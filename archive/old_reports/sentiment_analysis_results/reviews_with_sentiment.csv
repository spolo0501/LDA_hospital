6,review_13942,Cathy Miles,4,"I didn’t feel the need to write a review until today. I didn’t realize what a great hospital it  was until I was forced to go to another hospital. My father was taken by ambulance to John Hopkins Bayview despite us asking for him to be transported to Orleans street for care. At the Orleans street hospital the nurses and doctors were constantly in the room explaining what was going on with my father’s care. My father is bedridden and needs to be cleaned regularly and repositioned regularly. He was always clean and never once got a sore or even any redness after his two week stay. The hospital allows for a family member to stay the night with the patient and even has a family room with a refrigerator, ice machine and vending. The nurses are so friendly and always willing to help. Fast forward to his stay at Bayview. The complete opposite. He sat 32 hours in the ER waiting to get a bed to be admitted. He has a terrible pressure wound and another wound on his inside thigh from them putting an adult diaper on too tight. The nurses are rude. Every morning this week he has been soiled through the pads, all the bed sheets and covers and his gown. I asked to speak to the charge nurse, she never came. His room is full of medical trash laying on the floor. No where for a family member to sleep. My father has called us in the middle of the night to tell us he is soaked and he’s been pushing the call button for an hour and no one is coming. We have called and no one answered or they answer and say they will have the nurse call and then never return the call. I can go on and on.

From the moment I arrived until the day I was discharged, every single person I encountered—nurses, technicians, and all staff—treated me with the utmost respect, compassion, and professionalism.

What stood out the most was how attentive and caring the entire team was.

It didn’t matter what department they were from—every staff member carried the same positive energy and commitment to patient care.

50,review_12632,T C,1,"Years ago I saw a doctor at John Hopkins.  He was rude and arrogant, but he also didn't get the diagnosis correct. This happens and he was a sample of 1.  Doctor's are human - medicine isn't perfect, and so I didn't hold it against the hospital.  About 4-5 years ago, I went to a different department.  Over the doctor's objection, the scheduler's sent me to Bayview, which cost significantly more and delayed the procedure.  They did not inform me of the extra time or cost.  My doctor even asked why I went to Bayview when she saw me.

When I challenged the extra cost and explained that my doctor wanted me to go to Howard county, which would have been cheaper and faster, they refused to take the ""facility fee"" off my bill.  I had an attorney argue the case for me and finally the bill appeared to be settled to my satisfaction.  Four years later (today), they sent me to collections.  Even now, if I go to JHU's billing, I don't see the offending fee and my bill looks zero'd out as it has for the last four years.  I don't know if they are incompetent or malicious.

For me the critical thing is that they delayed my care over my doctor's order and then attempted to charge me more for their role in the delay in providing me treatment.  The fact that they appear to have sent me to collections 4 years later for a zero balance bill is just the icing on the cake.

Edit: I have called this number three times.  I end up in a voicemail box that is not set up.  I've called what I thought was the main patient relations number and they informed me that there is no way to talk to patient relations for the entire John Hopkins network unless you go through the individual Bayview patient relations first.  So, because Bayview patient relations doesn't have a voicemail box, you can't get to anyone higher up that has any authority to fix these issues.

Now here it is 2025 i come here for prenatal care,/ delivered my son here by c-section. OB team is great loved them all they did great by me . But my over all experience with some of the staff mainly dietary , which is a reason i will never come back nor recommend this hospital to anyone. The lady who answers the phone is very nasty and rude to patients who call to order their food like us patients need any type of negative attitude when we dealing and focusing on the health issues we got going on already. She’s mean for no reason and to have someone like that representing your dietary team speaks a lot about the hospital it self . I was known as Mrs pittman when i use to come here with my son Rashad Pittman before he passed. I will never come back here after my son is well enough to go home. Let’s talk about postpartum unit 8th floor. I was treated horribly, i had a c- section done and gotten staples, you talking about pain, when i bath no one helped me dry my feet or put socks on, it hurt me so bad to try and bend over i had to moan and groan and cry while doing it, i had to change my own bed , they never changed my linen i had to call for sheets to change my own. my trash and linen bin was full. I complained to the nurses to everyone to the point they actually got a attitude with me because i was not letting their neglect slide. I was not getting my pressure meds when i was supposed to be getting them , they would skip a day at times. I praised this hospital to everyone, i was so happy to be at the hospital who took great care of my 1 year old son , i am so embarrassed to praise them and having to walk out in pain because i couldn’t take no more, i didn’t sign myself out i just called my fiancé and said i had enough, i was in tears in pain and they didn’t care all they wanted from me was the key that gets me on to other units smh never again.

67,review_19271,Debbie Browning,5,"We are from Knoxville, TN and my wife had a stroke 2 years ago.  We came to Johns Hopkins last year for my wife to receive Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) from the Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (PM&R) center at Johns Hopkins.  The therapy worked well so we decided to come back this year.  Tomorrow is our last day of therapy.  We have been living in a hotel for the last three weeks.  Although it is very difficult to be away from home, our two visits to Johns Hopkins have been amazing!  First, I would like to recognize the ladies at the front desk when you check in.  They are always helpful and cheerful.  Millie, who does all the NIBS scheduling, is always there to help.  Next is Dr. Chao and Dr. Krasna.  They really care about my wife's condition and are always trying to help.  Last is the therapy staff.  They are amazing!! Daniel, Aara, Meredith, Nicole, Kristian, Erin, Leyna, Jacqueline, Megan, Elena and all the others who work in PM&R.  They are top notch!  Although it has been a difficult 2 years, Johns Hopkins will have a special place in our hearts.

69,review_44851,cinema v9,1,"Where to begin. From nurses and doctors having bad attitudes, being unfriendly, and telling you one thing then doing something completely different. Laziness.Nurses found it impossible to get medications on time or within a reasonable time. Not listening to my concerns. I was moved to 3 different rooms within the same unit. 2 rooms I did not have a bedside phone making food orders difficult as well as outside calls. One room was cockroach infested putting myself and my personal properties at risk. As well as the nurses refusing to enter my room due to fear of insects. Causing me to miss doses of medication all together or receiving medication as much as 1.5 hours late. I strongly recommend calling for medication early in attempt to receive it anywhere close to on time. Ask the cafe to read back your meal orders to have a better chance of accurately receiving what you ordered. I also strongly suggest taking notes including staff members names, detailed descriptions of interactions, and times and dates. I would not waste your time talking to senior patient experience representatives as they are rude and seem unbothered about patient concerns. While I was hospitalized I witnessed 3 separate patients leave against doctor's orders due to the disrespect and treatment from hospital staff. If possible do not come to john hopkins. Try Union Memorial or GBMC who both in my experience deserve a 5/5 for exceptionally friendly to patients.

Today, after speaking with a Concierge leader, I was informed that all the labs, patient charts, and medical records I submitted need to be translated into English. Why was this not communicated from the beginning? This critical information should have been made clear at the start of the process, not after months of back-and-forth.

To make matters worse, I was told that even if I provide the translated documents, it will take another 10 days to review them, followed by a six-month wait for an appointment. This is absolutely unacceptable, especially considering that my son is in pain and urgently needs medical attention.

What part of “my son is in pain” is not understood? At no point has there been any consideration for the patient’s suffering or urgency of care.

I have not been given an answer other than, ""FND functional neurological disorder"" and that he refuses to treat it until I do more and more tests for a POTENTIAL neurological problem.

This center will do nothing but waste your time, energy, and money. Do not take your loved ones here. UCSF is NOT what it used to be. They do not take your medical issues into accountance and will continue to do the testing that suits them. We are humans, not guinea pigs. When someone states and has medical proof they can't be shocked. That's means THEY CANT BE SHOCKED. No dose not mean, ""no"" at UCSF it means, ""wait till the patient is ready to say yes to whatever we want""

I could hardly talk because my body would not stop convulsing. The original Dr that saw me told me that I was probably having a reaction to the injections that my neurologist gave me st his office. He stated that I needed to be observed for 4-18 hrs. I arrived at the hospital at approximately 3:30 pm. They refused to help me up go to the bathroom. My sister arrived and she stayed until around 10:40. When she left she was assured that I would stay overnight. Fast forward to 1 am.

34,review_32358,Shane Zachery,1,"I was humiliated and threatened with security at Weill Cornell’s 8 North unit on Sunday, 07/06/2025 at 6:30 p.m. after using the restroom in my elderly father’s hospital room. I did not know that family members are not allowed to use the patient’s restroom. A nurse named Michelle (not assigned to my father) barged in without knocking and loudly scolded me while I was still on the toilet. I apologized immediately and explained I didn’t know—but instead of handling it privately, she stood there and continued yelling while I was in an extremely vulnerable position.

Honestly, I don’t have the talent to stay calm when someone opens the door while I’m sitting on a toilet and starts reprimanding me for something that clearly could have waited. When I raised this concern, the charge nurse on duty, Amy, responded, “What did you expect the nurse to do?” Wow. That’s not someone I would ever trust to lead a unit, let alone care for a loved one. Absolutely unacceptable.

They say they can call security if a patient’s family member gets loud—but who do we call when the nurse and charge nurse are the ones being loud, inappropriate, and lacking basic empathy?

45,review_59603,N C,1,"My 5-month old daughter was injured by the EEG technician, Junqi Zheng, and my MIL and I were verbally abused by her. Attached is a photo of the 0.5” scab on my daughter’s head where Junqi (the technician) scraped my daughter’s head so hard prior to placing the electrodes.

This is not the first time a complaint has been made about Junqi so I am frustrated that my family’s pain could have been avoided as it sounded like she should have been fired a long time ago. The fact that she knew nothing was going to be done about her poor performance is why I am writing this. I hope that no other family will be hurt by Junqi. She even said to me “go ahead, report me, here’s my ID. The camera isn’t on” (i.e the interaction wasn’t recorded so she knew she was safe). She is a drag on her team, patients and the Cornell network, and needs to be fired.

From the moment she walked in, she had a bad attitude. For example, she ROLLED HER EYES when I asked her two questions:
(1) how long the procedure would take, and
(2) whether she had to tie my baby’s hair in buns bc she was pulling so tight that it made her cry

At times, she was PURPOSELY HURTING my child. Junqi used a wooden Q-tip to separate my baby’s hair into sections and was scraping her scalp so hard with the wooden end that my baby was crying. She COULD HAVE USED THE SOFT COTTON SIDE to separate her hair into sections. She didn’t even have that much hair!

In addition, I asked her if we can use water instead of the suction to keep the tape on (the suction was making my baby cry even more) and she said “have you done this before” and I said “well we did a 1 hour EEG here at Cornell and they used water so was just wondering.” She ROLLED HER EYES and said “THAT WAS A DIFFERENT LOCATION.” Please note she COULD’VE SIMPLY LOWERED THE SUCTION LEVEL. The second technician did exactly that and explained that there are different suction levels. Why would you use the same suction level for an adult on a baby?!

When I asked for break because my baby was freaking out due to the pain caused by Junqi, leading my baby to scratch her face so hard it was bleeding, Junqi said “why are you here” and I said “well because she’s been having spasms”. Her response was “you can refuse EEG. You’re hurting baby”. I told her that I didn’t want to be there and wished my daughter was happy and healthy but that she was having spasms and she kept repeating “you can refuse EEG.” She thought this procedure was unnecessary, which is absurd and not her decision. And if anything, SHE had already hurt my baby creating a wound on my baby’s scalp.

This was the last straw and I told her if she was having a bad day, she should not take it out on her patients and that she didn’t have to be there. Her response was “ok it’s better for me to leave.”

Not only was my daughter injured, but Junqi wasted my time (I had to take off work to go to the EEG with my daughter) and many medical professionals time (from the NP to the nurses to the management team), her team’s time as her team member had to cover her patient, and 4 hours of my life as she did not complete the procedure and I had to wait that long for a new technician.

No actions were taken against this woman who hurt my child, no apology from her, and it is unclear whether she was provided training after this incident (i.e. use different suction levels based on patient’s age, don’t use a sharp wooden stick to separate a patients hair - use the soft side, don’t roll your eyes at patients, etc.)",Edited 5 months ago,2025-05-31,1,en,NewYork-Presbyterian_Weill_Cornell,NewYork-Presbyterian_Weill_Cornell.csv,2025-05-31,3508,-0.025594155844155822,0.4140313852813853,Neutral,-0.9921,0.107,0.861,0.032,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

They can hold your loved one here against their will, or the requests of the family - for as long as they want. We brought a friend suffering from depression and they held him for 3 nights.  He voluntarily checked in and was stable/sane the entire time. They offered ZERO therapy or psychiatric services except offering benzos for panic attacks. The cost for holding our friend against his will for 3 days was nearly $20,000. The entire time we were begging to
have him released and Dr Benudis said she will release him when she feels like it. They never discussed a plan of discharge or would give us any metric on what it would take to to have him discharged until the last day. Their job is to lock up the patient as long as possible and extract as much money as possible while
providing no medical services. It’s a JAIL CELL. A horrible facility and truly terrible doctors I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy. DR. Abigail Benudis was particularly terrible. One of the meanest and dismissive doctors I’ve ever spoken to. Incompetent and unavailable the entire time.

88,review_51147,K,1,"ER service is horrible. We were admitted to the ER the night before. By 3:30am they were confident the patient needed to be admitted to the hospital for a room. But no beds. So it is now 6pm, still in the ER without a bed. Staff makes themselves incredibly sparse. At one point, the patient needed a vomit bag since he was admitted for vomitting yet none were given as stand-bys. I rushed to the desk where no one was there. A nurse came with her back turned to me, I had to ask “ma’am” three times before she turned. At this point, the patient was already projectile vomitting on the floor. They did clean it up though- by sopping it up with towels. No custodian mopping any time after. There was also a half full urine sample behind our bed from god knows who. Each doctor that comes every 5-6 hours or so says something different or treats us like brand new. No one addresses the bedside family, and prior to the projectile vomitting we hadn’t asked a thing from staff. The patient also has something highly contagious, but that isn’t stopping them from cramming the area bed to bed with patients. I hope the old couple sharing the curtained area with us is healthy enough to not be immunocompromised. Oh wait, they are old and currently in the ER. Horrible facilities, horrible staffing issues. I have seen staff sitting around on facebook messenger (the same nurse who couldn’t be bothered to be addressed until projectile vomitting was audible), as well as several staff members sitting and scrolling tiktok. I get that there is a ton of downtime between test results, but for god’s sake just make these people do their rounds and talk to their patients so that they don’t end up projectile vomitting all over the floor.

my complaint was attended by the lady Kelly McCabe but apparently she misinterpreted my discomforts, she in her report dated October 15 of the year in progress I put her on the way to what she calls pain management by the nurse involved, and it is the opposite even though I told her about it. repeatedly that the nurse that day did her job in the best way and managed the pain in the best way she could, my discomfort was with the 5 doctors who during that stay were in charge of my health, they decided to remove the urine catater without evaluating the prostate, having on my chart a CT abdomen an pelvis with contrast dated September 7 that said that my prostate was enlarged so it was evident that my prostate did not allow my urine to go down alone, in its report also sealla who refuses to take ibuprofen on September 9 obviously had to do it I have kidney failure 3A and that drug is contraindicated but the Drs did not sin that detail either, another point in their report says that it was I who said that I wanted to urinate without the totally false cater urine and proof of this was that all the nurses were asked to please place the permanent catarer urine and they told me that no that the Doctors specified that they were going to urinate without the cater urine and proof of it was that was that all the nurses asked to do not to urinate without the urine catering and that they were going to put it on the doctor's. I had to urinate by myself and after having a strong discussion with the Dr who was in charge was that I agreed to put back the urine catheter proof of this this my discussion with her that must be recorded by requesting an interpreter from Spanish to English, another important point and to finish the Drs who in the end are the ones who make the decisions withdrew the initial catarer without 1- evaluating and checking that the prostate was still inflamed which made it impossible for me to urinate for me. same and 2- had changed the antibiotic 3 times, that is, they were not even ready to see if the antibiotic was the one to verify whether or not they should remove the catheter in principle and then to the horror of the pain of removing the urine without wanting to put the urinary catheter back fixed as at the end I pass after me arguing with the Dr in charge that night I agree to put it back, and I repeat it was I who told her everything about it, then do not tell me about the nurses involved that they did their best work, my annoyance is with the origin of that horror that were the bad decisions of the medical staff that...",Edited 10 months ago,2025-01-01,1,en,NewYork-Presbyterian_Weill_Cornell,NewYork-Presbyterian_Weill_Cornell.csv,2025-01-01,3252,-0.03685185185185185,0.357962962962963,Neutral,-0.9865,0.115,0.827,0.058,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

My mother is currently admitted and is getting absolutely unacceptable care.

If your family or friends are not in the ICU and having delirium and are at risk of falling DO NOT go here. They do not listen to you or properly document incidents that occur. My mother had issues of climbing out of bed during the middle of the night then they refused to put a 1 on 1 with her or allow my father to stay over.

They only changed their attitude once we were RIGHT and she fell out of bed which is extremely dangerous.

In addition to this they forgot to put her medicine patch on TWICE after getting scans. Doctors who examined her were confused where it was it, this is a critical medication that they missed and allowed her not to have for 12+ hours.

We have been working with patient services and nothing is changing. The only part of the hospital that world class is the ICU.

I'll say the manager on the floor has stayed in close contact with us to ensure that after the third scan that her medicine is put back on correctly (which still should be standard care) and one of the day nurses Ahmed did all he was able to do for us.

Only other highlight was the day nurse Jessica on the 8th floor but the night nurses were not equipped support with someone like my mother and put that on my father who stayed over and wasn't even supposed to be there (they made an exception).

27,review_20530,Karli Bossman,1,"Review for Dr. Christopher P. Eckstein, MD – Duke Hospital

I’m 21 years old and recently had a very disappointing experience with Dr. Eckstein. I was referred to him by my previous Duke neurologist, who treated me as a child for autoimmune encephalitis (AE). Since that doctor has since moved from NC, he recommended I see Dr. Eckstein because he is the head of neurology. He also mentioned that I could consider going to Mayo Clinic—and honestly, I should have taken that advice.

Despite my documented history of AE and worsening symptoms, Dr. Eckstein completely dismissed my concerns. He repeatedly said, ""I'm not saying you're crazy,""—but saying that multiple times made it feel like exactly what he was implying. It was condescending, unprofessional, and left me feeling unheard and invalidated.

I tried to explain that I’ve been experiencing episodes of severe headaches and intense neck stiffness that last for a week at a time—symptoms so painful that I can’t move my head, look up or down, or even turn my neck. I’ve had three of these episodes this year alone. Instead of taking this seriously or considering the context of my medical history, he told me it was ""just a headache"" and ""everyone your age gets those."" That is simply not true, and I know my body well enough to recognize when something is very wrong. He told me after we discussed my neurological symptoms he said my symptoms were residual anxiety and OCD from when I had AE as a child, but I couldn't possibly have that now because I don't look like I'm on deaths door.

He ultimately suggested I see a psychologist. While mental health is important, that recommendation felt like a dismissal of my legitimate neurological symptoms. As someone with a known history of autoimmune encephalitis, I expected to be evaluated seriously—not brushed off and told my symptoms were normal for a 21-year-old.

This appointment felt like a complete waste of time, and I left feeling worse than when I walked in. I would strongly caution others, especially young adults or patients with complex neurological histories, to seek care elsewhere if you want to be listened to and taken seriously.",a month ago,2025-09-28,1,en,Duke_University_Hospital,Duke_University_Hospital.csv,2025-09-28,2157,-0.07236928104575166,0.4999673202614379,Neutral,-0.5159,0.079,0.851,0.071,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

I had the unfortunate experience of visiting this hospital, and I can honestly say it was one of the worst I've encountered. While the doctors are skilled and knowledgeable, the rest of the staff leaves much to be desired.

The security department is particularly rude and disrespectful, making an already stressful situation even more difficult. It's hard to believe that such a crucial role in patient care could be filled by individuals with such a lack of empathy.

The kitchen staff was unhelpful and unpleasant, which only added to the frustration. The housekeeping staff was acceptable, but the overall atmosphere in the hospital felt negative and unwelcoming.

My son is undergoing treatment for cancer, a time when compassion and support are desperately needed. Unfortunately, the staff here seemed to have no understanding of that. The transporters who move patients around were also unfriendly and seemed to add to the misery rather than alleviate it.

This facility left me feeling more distressed than when I arrived. I would not recommend this hospital to anyone, not even to a dog.

After 6 hours on a gurney in the hallway of the ER a very kind cna found a room for her with some privacy.  We stayed in the ER all night with very nice nurses and a caring PA.  This morning we were told that she didn't meet their criteria to be admitted.  She was and still is in incredible pain and still stuck in the same locked up position.
Once we were told we were being discharged the urgency to leave the room became awkward.  I couldn't make them understand that my daughter couldn't physically get into her wheelchair and that we would have to roll her to the car on the gurney.  They immediately said that wasn't an option.  At this point I am so confused as to what they expect me to do. The sweet nurse was so upset because she didn't know what to do either.  She asked her manager and they agreed to push her outside on the gurney to the entrance where the ambulance brings patients to the hospital.  The manager was close to my age 56 and the nurse was quite petite so I was concerned about how we were going to pick her up in such an awkward position.  We get to the parking lot and they realize they need more help.  They enlist two other young girls and everyone has my daughter wrapped up like a burrito trying to shove her in the backseat.  They kept expressing concern about dropping her and I said please be very careful!!! She is paralyzed and a fall on the concrete would be awful.  The young nurse starting laughing loudly and said She’s paralyzed. Omg that's hilarious!!! I was so shocked and said what's funny??? She said omg. She's really paralyzed??? It was so uncouth and I know embarrassed my daughter who was already in a vulnerable situation.  They pushed and pulled and got her in the backseat still in the same locked position she had arrived in.  We left and came home.  We had to call EMS to help get her in our house.

Obstructions all the time. 10 years ago I was treated so well, drs and nurses were caring and I felt safe. But that is in the past, now, even if they do keep me they are cold, uncaring, and cruel. They don’t give pain meds for pain anymore because of the “War on Opiates”. Sounds like a good thing? Wrong! It is crazy. I agree we want to stop street use of opiates, but to stop using them for everyone else is crazy. My best friends daughter had sickle cell anemia. A very deadly, serious and PAINFUL disease. They treat is like dogs, refuse us pain meds when we need them, and give us antipsychotic drugs instead that make you feel like your having an out of body experience or that your Alice in wonderland! It’s insane. I thought it was just for us “druggies”- you know- people you take pain medicine for serious medical reasons(Not people on the street). But then I had my hair permed and the lady-78 yrs old had never had a pain pill in her life, had knee surgery. First they forgot to get her into physical therapy(this has to be done and started immediately or it won’t turn out well) for weeks, and she was in terrible pain. So much so she kept calling her dr saying i’m in so much pain. I don’t know what to do. I need you to help me. The doctor didn’t answer any of her phone messages. Finally set an appointment with her. And when she came in, the doctor said really snuggly so what is it you want? That alone to me speaks volumes.

The lady was in so much pain that at one point in time she had said things that let her husband to believe she may consider suicide. So he gave all of his guns away. This is a normal person who’s in so much pain. Her husband thinks she could possibly commit suicide.

One bill from the doctor and one bill for use of the facility. This makes no sense. Even after your copays your account sits dormant for weeks then the billing department calls to get authorization to apply those funds to something else after the fact. It takes about 2 months to get all of your final bills before you know what you really owe or are even paying for.

25,review_54755,Gina Lucky,1,"This death trap is the main reason my husband died. We took him on Christmas day and was given false hope of him getting a transplant. They scheduled him for testing in February. He was in and out of other hospitals until he was transferred to CC for his testing. His first week in the hospital, they gave him peritonitis from doing dirty dialysis. He was in so much pain that they started him on Dilaudid. Between the pain and medicine, he because delusional so he was transferred to ICU. They held the transplant over his head, telling him if he didn't switch to hemodialysis, they wouldn't consider him for a transplant. We agreed and they put in the port.  In his delusional state, he tried to pull it out. They strapped his arms to the bed for his own safety. He was claustrophobic though so this sent him into a psychosis. It was horrible watching him go through this. They wanted to install a drain in his abdomen to get rid of some of the infection. After over a week of him waiting for that, they overdosed him, had to narcan him and put him in a vent. They said he overmedicated himself because he had a pain pump at one point. Once they tired his hands down days before, they took away the pump.   Once he was stable from the overdose, they put in a drain tube, in a bile duct. When they tried to replace it, they nicked his gall bladder.  He finally came out of the psychosis but was never the same. He had to have anxiety meds, have the light on at all times and couldn't be left alone because of the trama he experienced there. They denied his transplant. He was in and out of a different hospital that was trying to fix his gall bladder.  He kept getting weaker due to not being able to walk around to get exercise and build his strength from the pain and infection from the gall bladder. He passed at home on July 14th, 2025.

While VIP suites and Premier Care packages are heavily advertised, regular patients and working-class families are often left waiting in overcrowded lobbies, facing long delays and limited resources.

This hospital was once seen as a cornerstone of community health, yet now it seems more interested in catering to high-income patients than serving the people who actually live here. The imbalance is glaring: fancy executive wings sit nearly empty while understaffed emergency departments struggle to meet basic needs.

It’s a clear signal that profit has overtaken purpose. Hospitals should prioritize equitable care, not exclusive services for the wealthy.

79,review_67468,Karli Bossman,1,"I would not recommend Dr. Jaime Ann Vondenberg. My experience with her at Cleveland Clinic was deeply disappointing and felt like a complete waste of time, energy, and money.

I drove all the way from North Carolina to Ohio to see her in November, hoping to finally get clarity and support for my ongoing health concerns. At the initial appointment, I shared that I had been treated for years as a child for autoimmune encephalitis, that I’ve had a positive ANA multiple times, and that I was experiencing symptoms like chronic fatigue and a red rash across my cheeks. I told her I suspected lupus, and she ran tests—eventually ruling it out. That was fine, but what followed was incredibly frustrating.

We scheduled a Zoom follow-up for February so I wouldn’t have to drive back, and during that appointment, she told me she didn’t believe I had any autoimmune issue at all—despite my medical history and repeated positive ANA tests. She also told me I should see an immunologist, even though she is double board-certified in both rheumatology and immunology herself.

When I asked about the facial rash—after a dermatologist specifically said it was not rosacea and told me to talk to my rheumatologist—Dr. Vondenberg brushed it off and said we should just try a cream because she thought it looked like rosacea. This felt dismissive and unscientific.

Later, I contacted her again after another doctor found elevated thyroid antibodies and wanted more testing done. I reminded her again of my history with encephalitis, and she told me to schedule another appointment. I did—even though it was over a month out—and when I finally saw her again, she was late and completely dismissed everything I had to say. She refused to run any more tests, and repeated the same opinions from our earlier conversations as if nothing new had been presented.

I don’t understand why she had me book and pay for another appointment if she had no interest in revisiting the situation or digging deeper—even when new labs were available and there was a clear history of autoimmune disease.

If you’re looking for a rheumatologist/immunologist who will actually listen, consider your full medical history, and take your concerns seriously, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere. This felt more like a routine dismissal than real care, and I left with more questions than answers.",3 months ago,2025-07-11,1,en,Cleveland_Clinic_OH,Cleveland_Clinic_OH_20251009_2224.csv,2025-07-11,2364,0.09242424242424244,0.35254629629629636,Neutral,0.9519,0.057,0.847,0.096,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

He sat down with me, became a human, and walked me through everything. Like intelligent, kind, genuine, authentic, and didn’t show a single desire to rush away from me, he saw I was anxious and he took time to explain to me everything. He did not owe me that level of one to one care but he stepped up and went above and beyond. I was worried about my kids and he did all he could to reassure me about the facts so far. Some people are meant to be doctors and Cleveland clinic seems to attract that top talent: shout out to Emergency room NP Sam who was on staff May 8th night shift  at this location. Anyway, it was evident in the speed in which I was taken care of, the kindness, literally having a doctor sit with you and walk you through scenarios if we do xyz.

Fast forward to now…. I brought my fiancé to the Clinic for her ascending aortic aneurysm and high blood pressure after several different doctors and specialists, again in Evansville, IN with no success! Are you seeing the issues here?

The doctors in Evansville have no clue how to treat their patients! The doctor she saw at the Cleveland Clinic knew exactly what her issues were and was able to readjust her BP meds, (she was on FIVE different medications with no success) and got her down to only three medications just once a day instead of FIVE medications three times per day!

The doctors, nurses, and other staff were absolutely AMAZING!!! Belinda McKinney in the registration office was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! She was SO CARING and so polite and friendly! She actually CARED about the patient! The staff at Deaconess Hospital in Evansville, IN DOES NOT CARE about the patients AT ALL!!!

The specialist doctor that treated my fiancé was so polite, knowledgeable, helpful, and professional! He actually CARED about her and wondered why she was on so many different medications for her blood pressure! He made her feel better about her aneurysm overall and putting her on less medications as well.

We are looking forward to working with the Cleveland Clinic and their team in the future. We’re DEFINITELY not going to let any more of the doctors OR hospitals, especially Deaconess Hospital in Evansville treat us again! They are absolutely HORRIBLE!!!

168,review_88349,Chris Myers,1,"Hello-We consulted with the Cleveland Clinic regarding my Wife's chronic Lyme infection after searching for help locally in WV. After two rounds of doxycycline, we started thinking that we needed to look outside of the area. She received her first Lyme diagnoses from a rheumatologist along with a couple others on this visit including ankylosing spondylitis. She tested positive for Lyme and was prescribed two weeks of doxycycline. She continued to decline, saw many physicians, and was ultimately misdiagnosed with MS as well as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. This same neurologist who diagnosed her with MS later agreed that she did indeed have Lyme, and it had triggered her ""MS"" after a spinal tap, serology testing and MRI's that revealed Lyme and the Epstein Barr virus. We then decided to consult with the big guns in Ohio since now she had two diagnoses of Lyme and had tried two weeks of doxycycline but was still in rapid decline. We were being told if she was still having symptoms after two weeks of antibiotics, then it couldn't be Lyme. Growing desperate we called and spoke with a very nice lady at the Cleveland Clinic and were surprised to find out they would ""treat"" my Wife. I cannot tell you how excited we were to finally get some help with this terribly common, but seemingly invisible disease. We made the appointment with the infectious disease doctor Chris Kovacs Jr., drove to Cleveland, booked a room and tried to sleep anticipating that everything was finally going to ""be OK"". The next morning, we arrived for the appointment at 7:45 and were impressed with the Clinic's ""Operation"" until we got in front of their doctor Chris Kovacs Jr. who broke our hearts and wasted our time and money. After listening to her case for approximately five-six minutes, he informed us that ""We don't have Lyme in WV and if she hadn't traveled to the northeast of the US then she hadn't been exposed to Lyme"" as to which I replied, ""I don't mean to be rude but, where do our dogs get it?"" he then said that my Wife ""definitely did NOT have Lyme"" and suggested that maybe she needed more attention at home after asking my profession, which is sales. Chris Kovacs Jr. then refused any testing for Lyme or co-infections and we left his office in tears wondering what just happened. We traveled back to WV and by luck ran into someone whose Mother had Lyme but was misdiagnosed with ALS. She was treated by a local doctor and her ""ALS"" went into remission. I couldn't believe what I was hearing and we got in touch with that physician who is now semi-retired and after proper testing, she finally got a more appropriate treatment for Lyme. This brave doctor reported the positive serology results to the Kanawha County Health Department. Now she is ""on file"" as having positive Lyme serology results and we have received Lyme Brochures from the Health Department published by the CDC, Lyme book markers, and vinyl yard signs that read with the warning ""Lyme lives here”. These were nice quality signs btw, if you are reading, please send more. I tacked ours up around the neighborhood. Apparently they track this sort of thing IF your doctor reports it through the proper non-insurance channels. She ended up getting treated with antibiotics including a PICC line with ceftriaxone. We are both very much still affected by Lyme today and if only our family physician had given my Wife $40-$50 dollars worth of antibiotics when she first presented, then maybe, just maybe I wouldn't be typing this at work right now. Any physician who denies Lyme can be a chronic infection should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of courage to help. They know the truth and Lyme needs to be given the credence that people deserve. It's a sad day when the insurance ""front"" tells you that ""You don't have Lyme in WV"". I'm surprised he didn't call it ""Lymes"". I would clearly give ""0"" stars if that was possible.

169,review_89643,Nkumu Mandungu,1,"Don’t believe the hype! Very good ancillary services/support staff, less than effective and relatively average to low skilled physicians with way below average investigative skills and diagnosis acumen! For an institution that is supposed to be amongst the best in the country, and best in cardiac care for several years in a row, I was sorely disappointed. Either they are buying their rankings or the ranking publications are simply skipping over the EP section… Once you get past the bells and whistles, e.g. massive state of the heart facility, concierge like service for foreign patients, etc… you quickly realize that this hospital system is mostly like any other, except it does an incredible job at marketing both its past and current exceptional achievements. These achievements  are carried out by a very limited few. In other words exceptional/thorough docs are in short supply in this hospital, like in any other. They just do a great job of marketing and advertising the accomplishments of a very select few physicians, who are the exception and not the norm. Note, you will likely not have access to these exceptional physicians as they are in high demand. Instead You will be farmed out to much less proficient physicians who are no different than your average local specialist… I dealt with the cardiology department, specifically its electrophysiology section… The staff/ancillary medical team were awesome; however the Electrophysiologist I dealt with, was poorly organized, not thorough and contrary to what their cardiac appointment staff advertised, did not deal with highly complex arrhythmia diagnosis and curative treatment… His approach did not entail any in depth investigative processes, e.g. review of prior incident QRS morphology, review of clues provided by prior and current imagery, etc… He did exactly what the avg to below avg EPs I’ve seen so far, have all done: (1) Focused on the primary symptoms that suited his skill set and (2) ignored any acute symptoms that fell beyond his expertise, while heavily relying on the medications vs. investigating the root cause(s)… (3) failed to enlist the help of more experienced colleagues. He did not address the root causes of the disease regardless of its progression and instead preferred to settle on highly curated symptoms’ treatment, while hoping that acuity or worsening would not be immediate… This of course nearly ensures that down the line, once the disease process has worsened, I will be back for more acute and expansive services… What a revenue model… I strongly recommend that (A) you do extensive research and identify which physician(s) has the skillset that is required, to not just “treat” you but to actually cure you/find and tackle root cause(s) of your ailment before going to this hospital. And (B) ensure that this physician can actually see you/is available. (C) most important: Ensure that they are thorough, which is largely the exception. WHY? It takes time and work, for which they may not get a financial return. Otherwise, you are wasting your time and money. Just stick to your local specialist. Do not let the appointment staff randomly select a physician/specialist for you, based on availability. The physicians who have high availability generally tend to be the least effective/least thorough ones; hence their open schedules… Oh and their patient complaint process does not entail a conclusive resolution mechanism, as the clinical teams are not obliged to take corrective measures or communicate those measures to the patient… which leaves you wondering why come back to this hospital… Bottom line: Don’t believe the hype. Do your homework. If you are not getting satisfactory answers, e.g. booking agents tell you that “all EPs treat complex arrhythmias” and the one they suggest is really good, don’t believe them… Insist on the one whose name you found through research or who was recommended by another patient with ailments similar to yours and who’s received treatment here recently. If this is not a possibility, go somewhere else/don’t waste your time and money.",Edited 7 months ago,2025-03-13,1,en,Cleveland_Clinic_OH,Cleveland_Clinic_OH_20251009_2224.csv,2025-03-13,4090,0.10885589978963468,0.42301587301587285,Positive,0.9622,0.041,0.887,0.073,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

171,review_29451,Megan Meier,1,"Well reading these reviews, it mirrors my experience. If I could leave a zero, I would. I fell for the thought this place was the best of the best. That I thought included quality care with good communication. I paid a premium price for trash services. Please do not waste your time, money or energy with this business. That is what it really is. Not a medical facility that actually cares about their patients.

I drove 4 hours for a procedure the doctor begged me to come back for because this is ""the best"", instead of getting this done locally. For the procedure, I was forgotten about twice, delaying this procedure over 2 hours and they even reset my locker code so I could not get my cloths to change and leave. The worker literally said, ""Oh your still here? I thought you were long gone and reset the lockers"". Once I got my cloths on, I came out to find my boyfriend in a dark waiting room; tv's were turned off (he had not idea where I was), all staff was gone and the janitor was cleaning the space. They closed that area down with not only a patient in the back, but a guest waiting with NO communication what's so ever. I did fill out their survey, hoping they'd reach back considering the situation. I have yet to get a response back from Cleveland about how they ""forget about"" patients.
I wish my experience ended there...it doesn't. Shortly after my first apt, I started a new medicine regiment this doctor prescribed. A couple days into this,  I received a very scary phone call from my pharmacy. He proceed to ask me how I was doing and specifically my heart/vascular system regarding the meds I was prescribed. Which was concerning as I am being seen for vascular issues causing GI issues post chemo treatment. I was given an anti-depressant that was suppose to ""help my stomach muscles to stop over working"" that has MAJOR side effects for vascular issues, including heart attacks. Which I was on the brink of going to the ER for chest pain. I have never had that kind of pain before. I also was informed that the ""high cholesterol"" meds he gave for helping bind food in my stomach do not play well together with the anti-depressant, causing further discomfort and issues to my GI system. The pharmacist was EXTREMELY confused and concerned what drugs I was prescribed and why I was given them. There are plenty of other options that could have been discussed prior to that combo (per pharmacists words). He then advised that I stop both meds right away and consultant a different medical professional.

Then to add more injury to insult, an MRA was ordered that ended up sharing exact opposite of what the doctor told me it would provide. Surprise surprise, it showed vascular problems, causing GI issues. The doctor then thought it was appropriate to send me a one line message on mychart. Completely ignoring these results went against what he previously said. I asked for a 5 minute phone chat right away as I can not get back into him in person till end of March to discuss meds and the results. I messaged Wednesday 2/26 morning and its now Monday 3/3 in the afternoon. No point of contact has been made besides some nurse Friday right before closing saying my message was received and the doctor would get back to me. I guess I am finally in line for a point of contact? There was no time frame or idea when any point of contact would be made. Wednesday 3/5 will be a week from my initial message. This doesn't even include any follow up on said meds are doing from initial apt over 2 weeks ago. Which is VERY concerning, considering what I learned from my pharmacist.

200,review_70209,Tonya Miller,1,I would not recommend Dr. Truong to anyone nor would I recommend Cleveland Clinic.  Her delay in care caused direct harm to a patient. My parents put their trust and my father’s life in her hands and with her negligent care she caused harm. My father has metastatic melanoma and had been referred to the Cleveland Clinic to Dr Truong in November 2024. He was supposed to start treatment in which the office failed to schedule. So we started to call the office and ask what the hold up was. By the time Dr Truong set up a telehealth appointment with my father it was in January. Keep in mind from November to January he had no treatment at all in which this allowed the cancer to spread.  Fast forward 2 weeks and still nothing had been ordered. My father was in a lot of pain so my mom took him to U of M ER in which they did CT scans and the cancer had spread significantly throughout his body since November. And I 100% blame Dr Truong for this. Her delay in care caused direct patient harm.  I do not recommend Dr Truong to anyone as she took an oath to care for her patients and failed miserably to do so. Now he will be getting his treatment at U of M and Columbus Ohio and all we can do is pray that her negligence doesn’t cost my father his life.,8 months ago,2025-02-11,1,en,Cleveland_Clinic_OH,Cleveland_Clinic_OH_20251009_2224.csv,2025-02-11,1253,-0.17500000000000002,0.5535714285714285,Negative,-0.9807,0.167,0.769,0.064,Negative,Negative (1-2★),True,True

This review is mainly about the accommodations for the families of pediatric patients here. My child had surgery that required a one-night stay for monitoring. We drove over an hour to be here at the Cleveland Clinic for this procedure and stay. They put us in a “room” that looks like an ER triage or quick care room. There is no pull out couch for parent(s) to sleep on. What is given was a small, torn up couch with zero space to accommodate one individual let alone two parents for an overnight stay. I’ve been to and stayed at many hospitals in the NE Ohio area with family members, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. This is supposed to be one of the world’s best hospitals. I am beginning to think that they purposely do this so patients’ families will purchase one of their overpriced hotel rooms for the night. I would have no issue with this if the patient wasn’t a 6 year old who needs her parents by her side.

They need to rethink how and where they situate families of pediatric patients. My daughter’s surgery and stay here will cost as much as a luxury vehicle.

248,review_76942,Dylan Holderness,1,"Many believe that Cleveland Clinic is one of the best medical centers in the world. I couldn't disagree more.. after receiving so much medical care in different states, CC is by far the worst. I moved back to Cleveland About nine months ago after receiving a lot of specialty care in Pennsylvania from (UPMC) and Colorado (Denver Health) both of which i was incredibly happy with and the many doctors that I saw over that time period. I worried about finding new doctors that I liked as much but tried to keep hope that I'd find ones I was just as happy with. Boy was I wrong. I've been to several doctors at Cleveland Clinic for most specialties, and each of them are worse than the last. They don't seem to care at all about their patients, only about prescribing the newest and most expensive non-generic medications for each condition. I had been on most of my medications for years because they actually worked, as well as insurance fully covering them. Now they only care about prescribing what's newest, most expensive, or that they make money off of. Even if it doesn't work or falls out of your price range they continue trying to convince you to take it. None of the work me, or my previous doctors did matters to them. Any meds you were previously on don't matter and will be stopped. I'd look anywhere else before giving Cleveland Clinic your time and your health.
I'm now constantly suffering after being taken off half of my meds. For example with my migraines. They don't even want you taking over-the-counter medications. Probably because they don't make the money from the drug company. I'd do anything to return to my old doctors and the state I was in with my previous treatments. Look elsewhere if you have any choice in the matter.
Its also very difficult to get an appointment for months or even a year+ and if you need help or refills on meds before you can get an appointment you're out of luck. I've pretty much given up on my medical care because of all this.

Well, haven't seen much of them. In fact we have only recieved one meal, missed three meals, missed my wife's prescribed pain medications that we were told she has to, have hospital dispense. They didn't!!!!! We have been told by more than 3 nursing staff that that is par for the course in building H. So, I run out to McDonald's, Burger King etc., to buy food for my wife, so she doesn't starve, under the watchful care of the Cleveland Clinic Staff. Just talked to orderly picking up and asked about tomorrow morning's breakfast. She stated that they don't take orders this late.  She has not left bed. No one has asked anything about orders. This place is atrocious. The worst hospital I have ever been to. Do yourself big favor, try ANY OTHER opportunities first. Cleveland medical clinic is way understaffed and overwhelmed with what they are trying to accomplish.  Cleveland Medical is a STAY AWAY FROM, at all cost hospital.
Now her pain meds are late again. Every person we talk to has some changing excuse. We told them her meds needed to be given at 4 am & 4 pm. First time was four hours late and was told that it was 8 am and 8 pm per the schedule.  Now tonight's nurse says it's 9 pm. This is not something to mess around with.  STAY AWAY FROM BUILDING H. These people do not give a darn about their patients. Well,  so much for day two. We'll, almost. A supervisor, by his words, should not be in that position. He's only 1 year hire. WOW. SERIOUSLY?? Your here to ask how you can help? Same thing comes to mind. You can't do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result. We've been through this already. We have stated our problems with the nursing staff. Orderly staff and even talked to the people behind the desk. SAME RESULT. NOTHING. We are stuck her trying to save my wife. It kills me to know that the first doctor WAS so strict about getting nutrition to her as quickly as possible, yet nothing. STAY AWAY FROM HERE.

Well day 2.5. Is off to a bit better start after discussion with supervisor.  Today, med are almost on time. Breakfast is coming about lunch time told by nurse. Wife's blood pressure is low 90/60. I hope this was expected after yesterday's shitty attention. I really don't think anyone here talks patient concerns to each other. I know they talk. See them standing chatting around each time I go out. It it doesn't better to day, we will go home and try to get into real hospital.
Okay now 1:00. No lunch. Wife was given low carb diet this morning. SHE NEEDS TO GAIN WEIGHT. LOOK AT THE CHART. NO ON READS. Asked nutritional nurse that came by. No she shouldn't be on low carb diet. No shit????? She blamed some other department. This Clevand clinic is a Death Trap.  Okay. They got this lunch meal here. It's nothing that she would have ever ordered. But it is something. Wow! Told the nurse April that the nutritionist said to let her know if we don't get meals. We told the nurse and she started giving me reasons why she didn't need to. I explained that we are suppose to tell her about missing or messed up meals. She said she is in contact.

I was expecting the outstanding care that Mayo Clinic plasters all over their advertisements but instead I was insulted, dropped as a patient then punished for raising a complaint. I have a chronic, mysterious condition that causes daily pain and even raised the suspicious of cancer. I waited months for an appointment hoping for answers.

I saw Dr. Lisa Speiser (Mayo Clinic Arizona Infectious Disease Department). During the visit she kept pushing me into a very invasive, dangerous procedure outside of her expertise. I told her that I almost lost my life this year due to procedure complications but it fell on deaf ears. Even worse, she dropped me as a patient after I asked a reasonable medical question through the patient portal. I have a full record of this conversation on file.

In that conversation, I politely asked her a question about new lab results ordered by another doctor. Her response was sarcastic, rude and she locked the message thread to prevent me from responding or continuing care with her! She refused referrals to other specialists when before she was handing them out on a whim (one of the doctors she referred me to told me he didn’t even know why I was sent to him – this visit was $1200).

Furthermore, Dr. Lisa Speiser ordered a service without my authorization or knowledge – I am glad I was sitting down when I saw the $900 claim.

When I complained to Mayo Clinic Patient Relations and requested refunds, they ignored me until I followed up. I then received a call from Melissa (no last name provided); she lied about granting a refund for the visit with Dr. Lisa Speiser and refused a full refund for the unauthorized service. She also lied that letters would be sent to me on this topic, to date I haven’t received anything (2 months after I filed the complaint). Furthermore she stated that the Medical & Administrative Leadership Team at Mayo Clinic reviewed my complaint, fully supported all conduct and would not discuss anything further. Melissa refused to discuss that I was left without care, a diagnosis and a potentially life threatening illness. When I asked for referrals to other specialists, she told me to call scheduling and do it myself. I feel that Mayo Clinic punished me for filing a complaint.

I regret wasting my time, emotions and health on this mess. Waiting for care that never came has only worsened my symptoms and for the “pleasure” of this experience they bill 4 to 6 times more than any other facility.

Completely awful, heartless and cruel way to deal with someone potentially dealing with cancer. Apparently this is the culture at this place since it was very clearly supported up to their Leadership levels.

To say that I will not be coming back would be an understatement. I am still in shock.",a week ago,2025-10-21,1,en,Mayo_Clinic_Arizona,Mayo_Clinic_Arizona.csv,2025-10-21,2841,-0.06722979797979799,0.4789608585858586,Neutral,-0.9985,0.215,0.726,0.059,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True
7,review_55950,Joe Hall,1,"The office of patient experience will leave you feeling exhausted and defeated telling you your only recourse is to file a case with the medical board against Dr Green. If you are unfortunate enough to need care from their Neuro team you had better have some amazing luck rolling those dice because if you get stuck with a doctor who will spend months gaslighting patients and staff ultimately calling me a liar that I never asked for an MRI in their 7T MRI machine you are stuck. I have asked to switch to another doctor with more integrity and care for their patients and the hospital refuses. When mistakes are made here they are never owned and the cost in borne by the patients and insurance providers. Never have I experienced such a basic oversight and mistake that is just brushed under the rug like my life doesn’t depend on it. I spent over a decade and millions of dollars in the care of Barrow only to switch over the Mayo as they made significant investment in the states largest MRI machine. Imagine my disappointment after spending an hour filling in the team of my medical history and needs and desire to follow up for imaging and continue my care with their state of the art equipment only to be placed in the wrong machine and then called a liar after months of back and forth and finger pointing between departments. You will cling to Hope waiting for an answer back from the Department of patient care only to receive letters telling you to kick rocks, expressing that your recourse is not them having better customer service or integrity but by you securing legal council and going after their state licenses. I feel like there’s a better way. I know there is, other hospitals are perfectly capable of it, but for some reason, this hospital is so adamant on protecting the lack of integrity of Dr. Green that they want to ride the horse to the glue factory. I am profoundly disappointed in this hospital and the lack of empathy and integrity that it has continually shown. How much state funding went to the building of these new facilities? Was it all private or did the taxpayer contribute to this at all? All I want is the care was promised. And now all I hear from my other professional friends in the medical field was I told you so about Mayo Clinic. I had so much hope for this hospital. So much so that I sent my dad to your main hospital in Minnesota for treatment after sacrificing a lifetime in the US military.

Mayo only seems to want to take on exotic or difficult cases that they can use to further their reputation online and stay relevant in the news!

My last endocrinologist was treating me for diabetes but I did not fit the traditional type 1 or type 2 forms.  I was having terrible hypoglycemia as well as hyperglycemia, and severe anxiety and panic at times.  The last endocrinologist advised that I get tested for more rare forms of monogenic diabetes. I went to see Dr. Westphal and she was incredibly dismissive of all my concerns and my symptoms. In her mind it was either an insulinoma or nothing else. She gave me notice that I had to be at the Mayo Clinic hospital in AZ (a different state from me) in one week for a 3-day fast - no food for 3 days while I get my blood taken every hour. My husband and I dropped everything to be there, but the staff seemed to not even know who I was or why I was there. They openly complained about her and that they had no guidance. She never even stopped in to see me except for about 1 minute at the end of the day as she had her purse and was leaving for the day. She ignored all of my diabetes symptoms - I was taking an extreme amount of water and peeing constantly while there. She kept saying that I don't have diabetes and refuse genetic testing. Ultimately during the 3-day fast, they gave me glucagon to bring up my blood sugar level since I was severely hypoglycemic. Since I do not have an insulinoma and she refuse to complete the genetic testing She did not know that I have MODY 12 diabetes -- a rare missense variant/mutation on the ABCC8 gene. This caused me to go into a partial seizure for over 15 minutes while at their hospital. The nursing staff and ER doctor there were amazing in their quick response to help me.
Afterwards the next day, Dr. Westphal came in to see me because she was not even there during the seizure, and she tried to dismiss it all is no big deal.  She tried to say that it was not a low blood sugar induced seizure even though I experienced it and had been repeatedly told it was by the nurses, ER doc and pharmacist there.  It was like she was trying to protect herself.  She told me to carry candy in my pocket when I go places. She kept saying that there's nothing wrong with me and that this is all normal.  I then saw a university researcher and medical doctor who within 5 minutes said she thought I had monogenic diabetes. I ended up getting genetic testing which confirmed this.  I was also diagnosed with celiac disease and moderate-severe systemic lupus, for which I now receive monthly infusions. Eating gluten was also causing my blood sugar levels to go all over the place. I could not believe the lack of empathy and the incompetence of Dr Westphal.  The only saving grace for the Mayo Clinic is the incredible nursing staff there. They were always on my side and had my back, advocating for me as much as possible. I would not advise anyone for care under Dr. Westphal.

101,review_86590,Lilia Kilmer,5,"Dr Henry Clarke did the impossible: he removed the botched knee replacement that quack from California had put in, installed a new implant properly, and in doing so, he restored my alignment and my ability to walk properly in the future. The entire staff at the Phoenix Mayo clinic is to be praised: the level of care I've gotten there in incomparable. It's a painful operation yet everyone there has gone above and beyond the call to inform me of everything, care for me and make sure I was as comfortable as I could be under the circumstances. I spent 2 nights in the hospital, I was discharged yesterday with a bag of meds and clearly defined instructions, and while I do have pain, I also have hope, now: I'm going to do my part in physical therapy and heal, and thanks to Dr Clarke and the Mayo clinic in Phoenix, in the spring, I'll be hiking again, my quality of life will return. Seriously, if you have any orthopedic issues, head straight to the Mayo clinic, you won't be disappointed. Best medical care ever, best staff, and holy footprints do they know their stuff.
EDIT: It's official: Dr Clarke is the botched knee whisperer 😂 I'm 13 days post op, walking without the walker and I started cycling today.  (It took 4.5 weeks with the previous surgeries) Knee bend is at 90 degrees and knee extension is almost at 180 degrees.  Also today I haven't needed painkillers.  Zero back or pelvic pain which had been plaguing me since the original surgery on this left knee. I can't believe my progress already, I am so, s stoked.  And grateful.

111,review_26438,CHRISTIAN WALKER,5,"UPDATE: 11/7/24-After my 3 week Post-OP tests/reviews I realized some things that I forgot to mention initially. First, thanks SO much to the surgeons for doing such a wonderful job, after removing the surgical tape my 5 scars looked better than expected. Second, thanks to the Donation team for the wonderful crystal donation card ornament and all take home gifts. Third, thanks to the IT team for helping to run a wonderful MAYO APP, without that application the entire system would not run as efficiently and flawless as it does, not to mention how well all my appointments were organized per hour and per day. I never had to wait more than 15 minutes for any of my more than 20 scheduled phone, video or in-person appointments over a 7-month period.  The finals words are for the housekeeping, security and landscaping staff personnel that do such an incredible job at both the Scottsdale and Phoenix locations. MAYO is AWESEOME!!!

""MAYO Nurse Fernanda"", let us start out with the words compassion and passion. Compassion for your patient, which is well above and beyond what MAYO Nurse Fernanda provided to me. Everyone else that also touched my life during the MAYO Clinic, MAYO Hospital, NLDAC and NKDO (Patty Graham) successful living kidney donation process that we all completed on 10/17/24. The deep personal and job passion that was shown to me, by all, during my visits for what I would have to say is, the most complete physical I will EVER have next to a NASA astronaut candidate, showed how much everyone cared about me and the kidney recipient, so we both come out on top of the world.

Having grown up with 5 nurses in my family and knowing the fact that the entire hospital staff cares for you, is the MOST important factor, the older you get, the more, how much more you realize how precious life is and how much harder goals like this are to accomplish, and it was done flawlessly and with flying colors. I never felt afraid once for my life or my safety during my multiple visits to the MAYO Clinic and MAYO Hospital, it also never would have happened without the help of all the wonderful people from NLDAC and NKDO that provided all the other essential information and guidance needed to make this donation successful.

If I forgot someone, I deeply apologize, but the following professionals, plus many others made it all possible: MAYO Nurse Fernanda, plus Nurses JC, Lacey, Katie, Rogers, ASU nursing students in training ""A"" squared, Dr. Nguyen, Dr. Cosentino, Dr. Moss, Dr. Beall, Dr. Washington, Dr. Lee, Dr. Khurmi and the entire surgical staff, pharmacists Danielle and Madison, CARE TEAM of Mark, Jeff, David, Nurse Shondra, Nurse Zach, Nurse Mark, Nurse Laura, Nurse Rachel, Nurse Candace, Ruth, Gloria, Tricia, Pamela, Cassie, Jed, Melinda, Sydney, Alba, Dr. Pooja and let us end this with a ROSE, Dr. Rose.

Everyone treated me like I was family, I would recommend with the highest regards, The MAYO Hospital/Clinic to anyone!!!

So after this point, I learned that I had a deadly infection disease.

The doctor said I could not have this drug as I would have to be hospitalized.  I had to opt for another drug which I reluctantly took home.  This drug did not cure the problem. Later, I received a bill when my insurance has always paid for treatment.  The billing agent texted the bill with no name or billing dept phone no.  Just the amount.

The worst emergency room experience I’ve ever had.

I came to UCLA Santa Monica ER on June 30, 2025, around 1:30 AM with dizziness, high blood pressure, and a severe headache. I was subjected to multiple failed and painful IV attempts by four different nurses. One of them even grabbed my arm roughly, showing no regard for my comfort or pain. My concerns were ignored and dismissed the entire time.

I was then hooked up to an IV without being given a call button, left alone in the room and unable to move. I had to scream for help through the door just to get anyone to respond.

This was negligent, unprofessional, and unsafe. There was no compassion, no basic care, and no concern for patient safety. I’ve filed a formal complaint with the hospital and with the California Department of Public Health.

What will make me switch to another system is the fact that billing is super expensive for what you pay for. Also, lack of parking at the hospital is a pain for patients when the lots are always full and when you do get a spot it’s expensive. Lastly, and the biggest issue, is lack of appointments. I have to wait months to see a doctor in various departments, which is longer than other hospitals/clinics I’ve been to. Even if you tell them an issue is critical (in my case, I have family history of stroke and I had symptoms of a mini stroke), they make you wait 4-7 months to see a specialist.

My requests for accommodation and a patient advocate were dismissed, and I was left unattended even after disclosing escalating hyperarousal, suicidal ideation, and while actively bleeding.

So the food will sit and sit and when the nurses bring the food in, it’s cold. Some days the food doesn’t come at all.

The second pregnancy has been actually worse, which I didn't think was possible.  They are billing me for my wife's pregnancy, and it has taken over three months for them to figure it out.  It has been re-billed three times, and each time is incorrect and takes 30-45 business days to get the next bill.

They do not want to sit there all these hours waiting for somebody to finally take them in the back there needs to be a different system. They need to revamp their whole emergency room. I have a suggestion how about they make an area where if triage thinks that the people that are less sick can go to and see a doctor and then that doctor there can determine if they actually need to go back into the ER. This would filter out the people that are less sick. I think it’s genius. Maybe they should think about doing it this way it would weed out the people that only maybe need an antibiotic or just have a cold and nothing else serious those people can get prescriptions or told they’re fine and go home.

80,review_76044,Darren Hill,1,"Review of Emergency Room Experience – April 28

I am writing to document a deeply troubling experience I had in the Northwestern Memorial Hospital Emergency Room on April 28.

I was brought in following a seizure. I was disoriented, in physical pain, and needed urgent care. Instead, I was labeled with a psychiatric condition and ultimately admitted involuntarily based on an inaccurate and unfair characterization.

According to my medical records, the psychiatric resident, Dr. Bowlby, cited “intense eye contact” as one of the reasons for diagnosing psychosis. I want to be clear: I have had this kind of eye contact since birth. It's simply how I look — and, ironically, this appearance has been further shaped by a long-standing and unaddressed medical condition involving facial bone loss and empty sinuses.

The ER team dismissed this. I had been seeking care for years at Northwestern for these physical changes, and rather than being evaluated or believed, I was labeled.

It is unacceptable to pathologize a person's appearance — particularly one they have been asking for help understanding and treating. It is even more damaging to use that as justification for forced psychiatric intervention.

I am asking Northwestern to reflect on how often subjective impressions — especially from residents under pressure — are given institutional power over someone’s life and chart. In this case, a seizure, and a visible anatomical issue, were overridden by discomfort with how I looked.",6 months ago,2025-05-01,1,en,Northwestern_Memorial_Hospital,Northwestern_Memorial_Hospital.csv,2025-05-01,1492,0.03508771929824561,0.4452380952380952,Neutral,-0.9611,0.135,0.798,0.067,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

After having a surgical procedure scheduled not once, but TWICE, having to make big sacrifices around the scheduling, they have dropped the ball.

If you are getting surgery, you will want to make  triple check that you are in fact actually covered and they have your correct insurance plan ahead of time! Get it in writing that they have verified your insurance and your information is correct immediately as their incompetent staff will inform you a few days prior to your procedure that you’ve had scheduled for 90+ Days! Also demand that their pre-op team schedules you 3-4 weeks prior to ensure you can actually keep your date!

STOP WAITING FOR THE 11th HOUR TO DO IMPORTANT TASKS THAT IMPACT YOUR PATIENTS. DON’T CONFIRM SURGERIES UNTIL YOU’VE VERIFIED PLANS!!!!

When we arrived at the hospital by ambulance, she was screaming in pain and just didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to do either. When they were checking her in, they asked her for her ID while she was in severe pain and acted like it was just a minor condition. They also couldn’t get the difference between internal and external pain, in which both need to be taken seriously. Her screams of pain were almost ignored. It was so serious that she could’ve died from multiple organ failure or developed pancreatic cancer. They then had the both of us wait in the lobby, where she was still in so much pain and needed immediate attention. I eventually had to call a friend nearby to advocate for her while the staff are the ones who are supposed to advocate for patients. Their communication is also an issue and it needs to be fixed.

Secondly,  the doctors never seem to be on the same page regarding the care of the patient.

Shortly after my retirement (4 years ago) I was diagnosed with radiation cystitis following the treatment for prostate cancer.

As a result of the miraculous, minimally-invasive robotic feat of Dr. Lee and his team our lives are back on track again!

Needless to say, my wife and I are so grateful that we were led to Northwestern Memorial.

In that moment, I had no idea how my story would unfold, but thanks to Dr. Patel and his extraordinary team at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, I am here today — alive, healthy, and able to embrace life more fully than I ever could have imagined.
Dr. Patel is incredible. From the very first moment, it was clear that he and his team were not only highly skilled, but also deeply compassionate. They treated me as more than a patient — they treated me as a person, a mother, a daughter, someone whose life and family mattered. Their urgency, care, and expertise were matched only by their kindness. Every nurse, doctor, and staff member went above and beyond to make me and my family feel supported, informed, and reassured during what was, without exaggeration, the scariest experience of our lives. I could feel that they were fighting for me as much as I wanted to fight for myself, and I knew I was in the best possible hands.
Thanks to Dr. Patel and his team, I recovered. I returned to work only six weeks later, something I didn’t think would be possible at the time. Since then, I’ve received a promotion, bought a new home, and even started a small family farm. Yes, after surviving a ruptured brain aneurysm, I apparently decided that goats and chickens would be the perfect addition to my life — and somehow, even in the chaos, it’s all been joyful and fulfilling. More than anything, though, I have been here for my daughters every single day. I’ve watched them grow, celebrated milestones, shared laughter, wiped tears, and read countless bedtime stories — experiences I almost lost forever.
Every single day is a reminder of the gift I was given. Dr. Patel and his team didn’t just save my life — they gave my daughters their mom back, they gave my family a future, and they gave me the chance to continue dreaming, building, and laughing (yes, even with goats and chickens in the mix). They combine world-class medical skill with genuine humanity, and I have never met a team so dedicated to their patients. Their compassion and care made a terrifying experience not only survivable but also, in many ways, life-affirming.
If you or a loved one ever need care, know this: Dr. Patel and his team at Brigham and Women’s are not just exceptional doctors — they are miracle workers who restore hope, heal families, and give people the chance to live fully again. I am endlessly grateful to them, not only for saving my life, but for giving me a second chance to keep building the life I love. No words can fully capture my gratitude, but I hope this gives some sense of the life-changing impact they have had on me and my family.
To Dr. Patel and every member of his team: thank you, from the bottom of my heart. You didn’t just save me — you gave me back laughter, dreams, chaos, and joy. You gave me back life itself.",2 months ago,2025-08-29,1,en,Brigham_and_Womens_Hospital,Brigham_and_Womens_Hospital.csv,2025-08-29,3173,0.19446520460671404,0.5088907947398514,Positive,0.9994,0.048,0.7,0.252,Positive,Positive (4-5★),True,True

27,review_44603,Anna Yelaun,1,"**If you’re considering a quadruple bypass surgery for your loved one—**PLEASE READ THIS FIRST. It could save a life.
I am writing this in heartbreak and outrage over what happened to my father-in-law. In mid-March, he was admitted to the hospital and told he urgently needed a quad bypass. His arteries were reportedly 80% blocked, and we were told he could have a heart attack “at any moment.” The pressure to agree to surgery was intense—from the doctors and, painfully, from us as a family. We were told this was a “routine procedure,” that he was a “perfect candidate,” and that this would give him a better, longer life.

That could not have been further from the truth.
Shortly after the surgery, he suffered a micro stroke—which should have been a red flag. Instead of investigating further, they rushed him to a rehab facility. Days later, he suffered a massive stroke that has now left him in a near-vegetative state, requiring constant oxygen, with a severe Stage 3/4 untreatable bed ulcer, and unable to return home. Since then, he’s endured even more trauma: additional surgeries like a tracheostomy that only worsened his condition and quality of life.

What we thought would be a healing process has turned into a nightmare. This surgery destroyed his life.
No one told us to get a brain MRI first. No one talked about prior mini-strokes. No one explained that his age or condition could increase post-op risks. We were just told to “trust the process.”
Let me be clear: Quadruple bypass is not a “safe” surgery for everyone. It’s not “routine.” It’s not “low-risk.” And no one should be pressured into it without full transparency and thorough testing—especially neurological evaluations. The system failed him. And it failed us.
Now we are left helpless, watching a strong, intelligent, beloved man fade before our eyes—all because we believed the doctors when they said this was the best option.
Don’t let this happen to your family. Do your homework. Ask the hard questions. Get second opinions. Get full-body and brain scans. And don’t let anyone rush you.

I was then notified that I qualified for the study and would likely be in group 2 pool, possibly even group 1 if people were disqualified. I was very excited.

72,review_10909,Assiya Amangeldiyeva,3,"Hi!
I would like to leave a review about our stay at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

We would like to our family's great gratitude to Dr. Khady Diouf, MD and her team for their professionalism, human attitude and care for us. Throughout my pregnancy, she looked after me perfectly. I trusted her as a specialist and I am very glad that she met my expectations, since this was my first pregnancy, and also because we have twins. She did her job admirably and I am grateful to her for that. I wish her to reach new heights and family well-being!

We thank the nurses Dana Wendy-Vermilya, unfortunately we do not remember the name of the second nurse, but she saved one of the twins when he began to suffocate during feeding, a very nice girl. Professionals, very kind and caring girls. They provided me with a lot of help after the cesarean section, namely, they took care of my condition and our twins.
Nurse Dana Wendy-Vermilya, taught me how to behave properly after surgery, took care of my comfort and took the kids away at night so that I would have the strength to take care of them during the day. Her care and affection were similar to my mother's, and I am very grateful to her for that. She showed and taught me how to properly care for babies, as this was my first experience of motherhood. She bathed the twins, which the other nurses didn't do. I wish her good health and family well-being!
The second Nurse is an excellent specialist who knows her job. She also showed me her care and professionalism. She took care of my twins, took care of them, and also took the children away at night so that I could get some sleep. I wish her career growth and all the best!

Many thanks to Stephanie's lactose specialist. A woman with a ""big heart"" who proved himself to be a professional, a great person and a very caring employee. She came to me after finishing her work, because she saw that another lactose specialist did not come to me (although she was supposed to consult me). I listened and conducted training on how to properly apply babies to the chest and checked everything. In the following days, she came to visit me and the kids, and also helped us to adjust the nutrition of the kids. I thank her for her care, for her human attitude towards me and my family, and for her professionalism. I am very glad that I met her. She is a great person, there are very few such people now! I wish her good health, excellent work and all the best.

I thank the entire team of anesthesiologists, pediatricians and surgeons who participated in our birth of babies! All are professionals and a great job has been done. I remember this wonderful day with warmth and a smile only from the good side. And these wonderful memories are thanks to the professionals in their field!

The biggest disappointment was with the nurses, especially on the day the babies were discharged. I was waiting for my husband in the nurses' room from morning to 4 pm to pick us up from the hospital. Since I couldn't take full care of the twins after the operation, I needed help. But the nurses did not help in any way, although they were sitting in the next room. It was very hard for me. They also did not explain to us how to properly put the kids in the car seats. We had to learn by ourselves through YouTube. No one conducted or explained how to take care of them at home.
For the first two days of my stay in the hospital, the nurses (I don't remember the names) took care of me very uncomfortable. They did not help and did not do their job to the fullest.

I wish the hospital management to pay attention to my comments and improve the service.",10 months ago,2025-01-01,1,en,Brigham_and_Womens_Hospital,Brigham_and_Womens_Hospital.csv,2025-01-01,3634,0.3190632284382285,0.5007444638694639,Positive,0.9997,0.034,0.699,0.267,Positive,Neutral (3★),False,False

They came and I asked to go to Lenox Hill Hospital but I was taken to this poor excuse of a hospital. I was seen by several drs and was asked each time what was wrong with me.  I could hardly talk because my body would not stop convulsing. The original Dr that saw me told me that I was probably having a reaction to the injections that my neurologist gave me st his office. He stated that I needed to be observed for 4-18 hrs. I arrived at the hospital at approximately 3:30 pm. They refused to help me up go to the bathroom. My sister arrived and she stayed until around 10:40. When she left she was assured that I would stay overnight. Fast forward to 1 am. Another Dr came in and told me that I was being discharged because they could not find anything wrong me. I was still experiencing symptoms and had horrible nausea and a horrible migraine. I had to dress myself and they wouldn’t help me to get a ride. Since I was still experiencing spasms, I was unable to put my shoes on because they were heels.

33,review_51426,Shane Zachery,1,"I was humiliated and threatened with security at Weill Cornell’s 8 North unit on Sunday, 07/06/2025 at 6:30 p.m. after using the restroom in my elderly father’s hospital room. I did not know that family members are not allowed to use the patient’s restroom. A nurse named Michelle (not assigned to my father) barged in without knocking and loudly scolded me while I was still on the toilet. I apologized immediately and explained I didn’t know—but instead of handling it privately, she stood there and continued yelling while I was in an extremely vulnerable position.

Honestly, I don’t have the talent to stay calm when someone opens the door while I’m sitting on a toilet and starts reprimanding me for something that clearly could have waited. When I raised this concern, the charge nurse on duty, Amy, responded, “What did you expect the nurse to do?” Wow. That’s not someone I would ever trust to lead a unit, let alone care for a loved one. Absolutely unacceptable.

They say they can call security if a patient’s family member gets loud—but who do we call when the nurse and charge nurse are the ones being loud, inappropriate, and lacking basic empathy?

This kind of treatment reflects a bigger problem. It’s no wonder others have shared similar experiences in their reviews.

44,review_26108,N C,1,"My 5-month old daughter was injured by the EEG technician, Junqi Zheng, and my MIL and I were verbally abused by her. Attached is a photo of the 0.5” scab on my daughter’s head where Junqi (the technician) scraped my daughter’s head so hard prior to placing the electrodes.

This is not the first time a complaint has been made about Junqi so I am frustrated that my family’s pain could have been avoided as it sounded like she should have been fired a long time ago. The fact that she knew nothing was going to be done about her poor performance is why I am writing this. I hope that no other family will be hurt by Junqi. She even said to me “go ahead, report me, here’s my ID. The camera isn’t on” (i.e the interaction wasn’t recorded so she knew she was safe). She is a drag on her team, patients and the Cornell network, and needs to be fired.

From the moment she walked in, she had a bad attitude. For example, she ROLLED HER EYES when I asked her two questions:
(1) how long the procedure would take, and
(2) whether she had to tie my baby’s hair in buns bc she was pulling so tight that it made her cry

At times, she was PURPOSELY HURTING my child. Junqi used a wooden Q-tip to separate my baby’s hair into sections and was scraping her scalp so hard with the wooden end that my baby was crying. She COULD HAVE USED THE SOFT COTTON SIDE to separate her hair into sections. She didn’t even have that much hair!

In addition, I asked her if we can use water instead of the suction to keep the tape on (the suction was making my baby cry even more) and she said “have you done this before” and I said “well we did a 1 hour EEG here at Cornell and they used water so was just wondering.” She ROLLED HER EYES and said “THAT WAS A DIFFERENT LOCATION.” Please note she COULD’VE SIMPLY LOWERED THE SUCTION LEVEL. The second technician did exactly that and explained that there are different suction levels. Why would you use the same suction level for an adult on a baby?!

When I asked for break because my baby was freaking out due to the pain caused by Junqi, leading my baby to scratch her face so hard it was bleeding, Junqi said “why are you here” and I said “well because she’s been having spasms”. Her response was “you can refuse EEG. You’re hurting baby”. I told her that I didn’t want to be there and wished my daughter was happy and healthy but that she was having spasms and she kept repeating “you can refuse EEG.” She thought this procedure was unnecessary, which is absurd and not her decision. And if anything, SHE had already hurt my baby creating a wound on my baby’s scalp.

This was the last straw and I told her if she was having a bad day, she should not take it out on her patients and that she didn’t have to be there. Her response was “ok it’s better for me to leave.”

Not only was my daughter injured, but Junqi wasted my time (I had to take off work to go to the EEG with my daughter) and many medical professionals time (from the NP to the nurses to the management team), her team’s time as her team member had to cover her patient, and 4 hours of my life as she did not complete the procedure and I had to wait that long for a new technician.

No actions were taken against this woman who hurt my child, no apology from her, and it is unclear whether she was provided training after this incident (i.e. use different suction levels based on patient’s age, don’t use a sharp wooden stick to separate a patients hair - use the soft side, don’t roll your eyes at patients, etc.)",Edited 5 months ago,2025-05-12,1,en,NYP_Weill_Cornell_NY,NYP_Weill_Cornell_NY_20251009_2228.csv,2025-05-12,3508,-0.025594155844155822,0.4140313852813853,Neutral,-0.9921,0.107,0.861,0.032,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

79,review_5488,Eric,1,"Review for the Psychiatric E.R. It is important to know that this is nothing more than a holding cell. They can hold your loved one here against their will, or the requests of the family - for as long as they want. We brought a friend suffering from depression and they held him for 3 nights.  He voluntarily checked in and was stable/sane the entire time. They offered ZERO therapy or psychiatric services except offering benzos for panic attacks. The cost for holding our friend against his will for 3 days was nearly $20,000. The entire time we were begging to
have him released and Dr Benudis said she will release him when she feels like it. They never discussed a plan of discharge or would give us any metric on what it would take to to have him discharged until the last day. Their job is to lock up the patient as long as possible and extract as much money as possible while
providing no medical services. It’s a JAIL CELL. A horrible facility and truly terrible doctors I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy. DR. Abigail Benudis was particularly terrible. One of the meanest and dismissive doctors I’ve ever spoken to. Incompetent and unavailable the entire time. Keep in mind they make the patient sign away their rights once they are admitted and we were LUCKY to get him out in 3 days.

88,review_28151,K,1,"ER service is horrible. We were admitted to the ER the night before. By 3:30am they were confident the patient needed to be admitted to the hospital for a room. But no beds. So it is now 6pm, still in the ER without a bed. Staff makes themselves incredibly sparse. At one point, the patient needed a vomit bag since he was admitted for vomitting yet none were given as stand-bys. I rushed to the desk where no one was there. A nurse came with her back turned to me, I had to ask “ma’am” three times before she turned. At this point, the patient was already projectile vomitting on the floor. They did clean it up though- by sopping it up with towels. No custodian mopping any time after. There was also a half full urine sample behind our bed from god knows who. Each doctor that comes every 5-6 hours or so says something different or treats us like brand new. No one addresses the bedside family, and prior to the projectile vomitting we hadn’t asked a thing from staff. The patient also has something highly contagious, but that isn’t stopping them from cramming the area bed to bed with patients. I hope the old couple sharing the curtained area with us is healthy enough to not be immunocompromised. Oh wait, they are old and currently in the ER. Horrible facilities, horrible staffing issues. I have seen staff sitting around on facebook messenger (the same nurse who couldn’t be bothered to be addressed until projectile vomitting was audible), as well as several staff members sitting and scrolling tiktok. I get that there is a ton of downtime between test results, but for god’s sake just make these people do their rounds and talk to their patients so that they don’t end up projectile vomitting all over the floor.

my complaint was attended by the lady Kelly McCabe but apparently she misinterpreted my discomforts, she in her report dated October 15 of the year in progress I put her on the way to what she calls pain management by the nurse involved, and it is the opposite even though I told her about it. repeatedly that the nurse that day did her job in the best way and managed the pain in the best way she could, my discomfort was with the 5 doctors who during that stay were in charge of my health, they decided to remove the urine catater without evaluating the prostate, having on my chart a CT abdomen an pelvis with contrast dated September 7 that said that my prostate was enlarged so it was evident that my prostate did not allow my urine to go down alone, in its report also sealla who refuses to take ibuprofen on September 9 obviously had to do it I have kidney failure 3A and that drug is contraindicated but the Drs did not sin that detail either, another point in their report says that it was I who said that I wanted to urinate without the totally false cater urine and proof of this was that all the nurses were asked to please place the permanent catarer urine and they told me that no that the Doctors specified that they were going to urinate without the cater urine and proof of it was that was that all the nurses asked to do not to urinate without the urine catering and that they were going to put it on the doctor's. I had to urinate by myself and after having a strong discussion with the Dr who was in charge was that I agreed to put back the urine catheter proof of this this my discussion with her that must be recorded by requesting an interpreter from Spanish to English, another important point and to finish the Drs who in the end are the ones who make the decisions withdrew the initial catarer without 1- evaluating and checking that the prostate was still inflamed which made it impossible for me to urinate for me. same and 2- had changed the antibiotic 3 times, that is, they were not even ready to see if the antibiotic was the one to verify whether or not they should remove the catheter in principle and then to the horror of the pain of removing the urine without wanting to put the urinary catheter back fixed as at the end I pass after me arguing with the Dr in charge that night I agree to put it back, and I repeat it was I who told her everything about it, then do not tell me about the nurses involved that they did their best work, my annoyance is with the origin of that horror that were the bad decisions of the medical staff that...",Edited 9 months ago,2025-01-12,1,en,NYP_Weill_Cornell_NY,NYP_Weill_Cornell_NY_20251009_2228.csv,2025-01-12,3252,-0.03685185185185185,0.357962962962963,Neutral,-0.9865,0.115,0.827,0.058,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

My mother is currently admitted and is getting absolutely unacceptable care.

If your family or friends are not in the ICU and having delirium and are at risk of falling DO NOT go here. They do not listen to you or properly document incidents that occur. My mother had issues of climbing out of bed during the middle of the night then they refused to put a 1 on 1 with her or allow my father to stay over.

They only changed their attitude once we were RIGHT and she fell out of bed which is extremely dangerous.

In addition to this they forgot to put her medicine patch on TWICE after getting scans. Doctors who examined her were confused where it was it, this is a critical medication that they missed and allowed her not to have for 12+ hours.

We have been working with patient services and nothing is changing. The only part of the hospital that world class is the ICU.

I'll say the manager on the floor has stayed in close contact with us to ensure that after the third scan that her medicine is put back on correctly (which still should be standard care) and one of the day nurses Ahmed did all he was able to do for us.

Only other highlight was the day nurse Jessica on the 8th floor but the night nurses were not equipped support with someone like my mother and put that on my father who stayed over and wasn't even supposed to be there (they made an exception).

My significant other was in patient following surgery; and the care on the floor was worse than any I have had or seen. Call buttons are not responded to for 10, 15 minutes. The noise outside the door (which never closed) is so bad that no one could sleep. The staff is all very lovely, but there’s not enough of them to go round. The room was so crammed and uncomfortable and just not nice. The bathroom could have been way cleaner.

Downstairs, it’s worse than the security line at Newark airport. An HOUR to get thru as a visitor. Absolutely ridiculous process. They don’t give you a pass for the number of days your family will be there, or even for multiple days at all. There’s no point to security.

The surgical process was impressive, on time, and professional. The rest was lackluster and didn’t feel good. I personally would avoid this hospital for any in patient stays because of what I experienced.

I was in patient up the street at THE HSS and it was like the Ritz. I absolutely adored them. They treated me with such concern and care. I had a nutritionist assigned to me from the first night.

Seven years later, I can say that the experience traumatized me and left me with even more issues than I had when I arrived. The staff here appears to have an obsession with attempting to diagnose its patients with any and every mental health disorder, and displaying one symptom one time is apparently enough grounds for them to do so - one of the nurses asked me if I sometimes find myself struggling to focus during school, and when I said ""eh, sometimes,"" her response was IMMEDIATELY ""we're going to look into an ADHD diagnosis."" Really? Having a singular trait of a disorder that isn't even prevalent enough to impact my daily life and functioning is good enough for you to try and diagnose me? They would routinely come up with a new disorder to try and ""look into"" for me - ADHD, autism, Asperger's syndrome, social communication disorder - not once stopping to consider that I was maybe just a teenage girl struggling to process a severe and very recent trauma. The way they all grasped at straws to answer the question of ""what's wrong with her"" made me feel as though the trauma and abuse I endured was my own fault as it CLEARLY must have been caused by deficits in my own brain, not the experiences I'd had or the environment I was in. What I needed was coping skills to process my trauma, NOT to have some arbitrary label forced onto me - which is exactly what they did.

The entire experience was seamless and surprisingly painless—from consultation to recovery.

Dr. Gorenstein’s skill and compassion truly changed my life. His expertise gave me the confidence to go through with a procedure that I had put off for far too long, and the outcome has been nothing short of miraculous. I now live with significantly less discomfort and far more confidence—something I never thought would be possible.

I also want to give a special thank you to Sabina Shpati, the Practice Associate, who was incredibly supportive throughout the entire process. She helped guide me every step of the way with care and kindness, making what could have been an overwhelming experience feel manageable and reassuring.

To anyone suffering from Hyperhidrosis—please know that there is help out there. I wholeheartedly recommend the center at Columbia. This surgery has opened a new chapter in my life, and I am beyond thankful to everyone who made it possible.

89,review_64530,N H,1,"THEY WILL KILL YOU! I was admitted to NYP hospital for aortic valve replacement. They put me on a PCA pump with dialudid despite warning that i do not do well with dilaudid and should not be given it ( worse, they ordered the PCA pump less than an hour after I was snapping selfies of silly faces and sending them to my coworkers/bosses, so I was in good spirits and not pain to warrant pain needing to be escalated to a PCA pump). Afterwards, I became oversedated while being on a PCA pump (as staff put the button in my hand and pressed it for me) and required multiple doses of Narcan but my mental state was still altered. I also had fluid in my lungs from the respiratory depression but pneumonia couldn't be ruled out so Dr. Groves prescribed Zosyn. However, this is noted in my chart as a severe allergy with the reaction being severe thrombocytopenia. Very rapidly my platelets dropped from 165 to 5. This intentional oversight led to severe thrombocytopenia, necessitating urgent intubation and a head CT scan to rule out bleeding or a stroke. However, Dr. Groves did not tell my sisters that he gave me the zosyn and tried covering up the reason for the CT scan and sedation. the CT showed that I had a stroke but no one told my family about this or started me on medication to prevent another one. I only found out a year after when I consulted a neurologist and she then started me on cholesterol medicine that is necessary as per guidelines. when I woke up from sedation  while I was in the hospital, and was told that I was given the medication, I was furious and felt so violated as I know it was noted in my chart previously. The complication significantly prolonged my hospital stay (including being restrained and sedated for multiple days that I won't ever get back) and led to a series of traumatic experiences. I developed a wound infection that required more surgery.
I started therapy shortly after I was discharged and continue to suffer from PTSD, major depressive disorder  and anxiety, all stemming from this experience. I also left my job because it was triggering and too hard for me (I worked as an administrator in a medical/surgical practice). I also use a walking stick because I continue to deal with dizziness and balance issues, new after this hospitalization.

Yes, I am alive but my life as I knew it before is gone. NYP you really messed up and I will tell you this, you have violated me and made me feel so powerless, but I will do everything in my power, no matter how little, to make sure everyone knows what you did and that you will not get away with this.

Also, stop harassing me over my balance. I'm not paying anything to you. You offered me $50K to settle when you billed my insurance $1.3 MILLION in the month I was there.

I understand this is the responsibility of the Information Technology team at MGH -- I wonder if they realize the gravity of such poor design.  I also wonder if they understand the importance of training the MGH employees who have to deal with this system.  If I was a senior citizen or someone of lesser tenacity, I would never have completed my task with MGH (to get care) because of this confusing, inadequate, error-prone calling system.  Do better, MGH Information Technology. It's a shame that this phone system is the front face of all the good, talented, hardworking people who work for MGH.

May 30, 2025:  As an update, my general practitioner's office (not with the MGH system) followed all the correct procedures, following my instructions provided by MGH's website, automated messages, and even a person, and it was still inaccurate.  When they finally faxed the correct number, the intake people couldn't find the fax!  So, my GP's office sent it again with special attention to a human I finally found willing to watch for the fax. I repeat again without being hyperbolic, this system is a travesty and a risk to people's lives. How can the MGH administration stand by this system?  Do you find it reliable?  Are you proud of it?  If not, are you doing anything about it?

I also tried to use patient advocacy and called them a number of times and they did *not* at all help me achieve an outcome.  In fact, I called several times and I did not receive a reply.

I shared this story with a friend whose wife is a *doctor* at the Children's Hospital and she, too, couldn't get in touch with a specialist!  So, my friend actually showed up in person at MGH to finally close the loop.  This is really sickening for MGH to let this happen.",Edited 4 months ago,2025-06-30,1,en,Massachusetts_General_Hospital,Massachusetts_General_Hospital.csv,2025-06-30,2332,0.05578754578754581,0.6036446886446887,Neutral,0.9474,0.058,0.843,0.099,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

Throughout the entire process, it was clear that my dad was in the best hands possible, and Dr. Ganesh’s calm and caring demeanor gave us all peace of mind.

The surgery and recovery exceeded our expectations. My dad was up and walking the very next day without any pain, which was truly surprising to him. His recovery has continued to be smooth, and two months later, he just keeps getting better and stronger. The day after the surgery, Dr. Ganesh was there to personally check on him, take care of the stitches, and ensure everything was on track.

I did not call to make the appointment, this office called me multiple times to make the appointment which should have set off red flags right there.

I literally got stuck with an over $200 bill just to schedule a surgery I DID NOT NEED. I was given zero options besides surgery, the ONLY reason I was being checked out for this was ignored, there was no mention of doing a biopsy and I was made to believe that the removal was necessary. Medical records for the appointment were not fully accurate, lipoma was stated to be considerably newer than it was.

2. The doctor was extremely rude snd impatient when I asked for the note to return to work to be adjusted to reflect necessary documentation my federal government employment requires, and even said she couldn’t help me because it was nearing the end of her shift and she had a lot still left to do.

3. I was in immense pain from a traumatic head injury and was discharged, very quickly (could barely walk), without any prescription for medication.

I had already paid for my bill, but in July, UCLA called me again, claiming I never paid.

I contacted the insurance company. They confirmed they did pay the claim at the end of June, but said the hospital never accepted the payment, so the funds were not processed.

I tried to help by asking if I could provide a transaction ID to UCLA for confirmation.

I’m now caught in a ridiculous loop where both sides expect me to be the coordinator, while refusing to communicate with each other.

While I was literally drafting this post, I told the insurance company that I am disappointed and mad. That got someone to escalate my case to their advocate team.

21,review_84686,Jess Edo,1,"Absolutely do not recommend UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center.

My original review is too many words. To read it I have attached it as pictures labelled pages 1-5.

I am a mother of two, and my experience at this hospital was traumatic beyond words. I’ve waited almost a year to share this because it’s still painful, but other families deserve to know what happened.

On July 24, 2024, my toddler had a febrile seizure for the first time. We were taken to UCLA ER. She tested positive for COVID, and her personal neurologist (from CHLA) advised me via phone that she was safe to go home for monitoring as a provoke febrile seizure was the cause. Despite that, UCLA insisted on admitting her—and what followed was a complete nightmare.

🔻 I was threatened with CPS for trying to care for both children:
I was 3 months postpartum with a COVID-positive, exclusively breastfed infant at home. I explained that I needed to breastfeed him, and he had a fever too. They refused to let me bring him in to the hospital and said that if I left to care for him and discharged my daughter, they would report me to Child Protective Services for medical neglect. I had no choice—I felt like a hostage.

🔻 No accommodations for breastfeeding or basic nutrition:
I was given a breast pump, but my baby does not take bottles, and I had no way to get the milk to him. Once checked into the room, they gave me crackers and sugary cereal—no real food for my daughter or I —even though I hadn’t eaten in hours. I was not allowed to leave to get food, nor could staff bring anything from the lobby. My daughter has a gluten allergy and they had nothing for her either.

🔻 Prescribed dangerous medication:
UCLA discharged my daughter with Diazepam and Keppra for epilepsy—despite no epilepsy diagnosis. Weeks later, in Australia, I used the Diazepam during another febrile seizure, and it caused respiratory distress. Emergency responders and doctors were shocked at the dosage—way too high for a toddler. My U.S. pediatrician agreed. I had to give my daughter rescue breaths for 15 minutes until help arrived. Horrifying.

🔻 Delayed discharge and conflicting communication:
We were told multiple times we were being discharged. But we weren’t—staff seemed to be stalling for a full 24-hour observation period without being upfront. A nurse even admitted doctors were ""lollygagging.” When I finally confronted the doctor in front of his students, we were discharged 30 minutes later. They knew this whole time I had a covid positive 3 month old at home who was not allowed in the hospital who had also not had my milk for almost a 24hour period.

🔻 Financial stress mishandled:
While in emotional crisis, I was approached about insurance. Turns out my daughter’s name was misspelled, which caused the issue. After correcting it, I asked about financial assistance—none was available, and our plan had a 30% co-insurance. Just what every overwhelmed parent needs in a moment of crisis.

🔻 Ignored by Patient Experience team:
I contacted the patient care department afterward. They promised to look into the counselor who threatened CPS and the medication issue. I sent emails and our $8,940 bill as requested—and was completely ghosted. No response. No accountability. I have my email thread as proof.

👎 This hospital lacks empathy, trauma-informed care, and safe medical judgment.
* They endangered my infant and toddler.
* They created emotional trauma I am still processing.
* They ignored my neurologist’s medical advice.
* They threatened a loving, competent mother with CPS.
* They prescribed a medication that almost killed my child.

For that reason it’s a nurse’s and Provider’s job to advocate for the patient. I do not recommend anyone to seek care here, you’re better off being dead. So many other doctors from other hospitals can also agree that anyone who gets care here passes. It’s the sad truth. Treating a patient to be comfortable till they pass is not ICU way! If you have a loved one who needs a transplant I wish you best of luck because nobody communicates in this place and they treat you dumb unless you know your stuff but overall still give you the run around.

79,review_6457,Pug Luv,5,"This hospital and medical center completely changed my life when NO other Doctor was willing or able to help! I am surprised that UCLA medical doesn’t have 4-5 star rating, but people usually write reviews to complain.  I am making sure to share my personal 5 star experience.  I have been to SO many doctors, surgeons, and hospitals for years to try to fix my body.  My condition limited my life in a way that caused me to spend over 6 hours a day in the bathroom.  I had no life.  My anatomy was completely disfigured and I could not perform basic human functions.  I was referred to UCLA because other doctors and surgeons had tried everything with no success.  I had given up hope and I was desperate.  I was finally given a referral to UCLA.  I met with Dr. Michelle Torosis (who is a Urogynecologist and excellent surgeon).  She made sure that I was taken care of from a surgical AND functional standpoint.  She was also very thorough in order to make sure I had the best possible outcome.  The surgeons, specialists, and nurses were SO KIND and understanding.   I have never been to a hospital where every staff member is so understanding, not judgmental, patient, and knowledgeable.  I am an RN, so I am very picky about the standard of care, but I was blown away!  During my surgery and hospital stay, the pain team specialists worked VERY closely with me because I am a chronic pain patient.  They went over and above to help me and they used up to date evidence-based  practice to help me.  All of the different specialties worked closely together to manage my care, so there were no communication issues.  The case managers are efficient, thorough, and very helpful.  They literally set everything up for my outpatient needs, and I didn’t have to worry about anything.  Also, this hospital is not like a regular community hospital or clinic.  You should expect the best level of care.  Let’s just say that I am recovering now and the results of my surgery are above and beyond what I expected.  Dr. Torosis, Dr. Fain, and Dr. Rossette are incredible surgeons and they are so kind.  Most surgeons have terrible bedside manner.  However, this was never an issue here!  As someone who is an RN and has been a patient in and out of other hospitals, I can confidently say that I wouldn’t want to go anywhere else.  Also, the nurses in PACU, PTU, and my floor nurses (Yo and Clara), deserve recognition.  The pain management team is top notch, as well.  Hopefully they all receive the recognition they deserve!

5,review_34776,Anne Berkowitz,1,"During my PRP appointment at Cedars-Sinai orthopedic office at 8635 West 3rd Street
Suit 990, Los Angeles CA 90047, the procedure for collecting blood involved the use of multiple types of collection tubes, handled in a way that left me quite confused and uneasy:
•	Initially, a yellow‑capped tube (Yellow Bio Tube) was used; however, the blood clotted in that tube.
•	Lab nurse Jackson (who was called in to assist due to my thin veins) then requested a red‑capped tube (Red Bio Tube), but the blood clotted again.
•	Nurse A (tall, long dark hair, Latina) then poured the blood from the red‑capped tube into the original yellow‑capped tube — without wearing gloves and facial mask and talking at the same time (a clear violating standard infection control protocols).
•	When the blood clotted again, Jackson asked for another red‑capped tube. At that point, Nurse A claimed there were no more red‑capped tubes available and brought over another yellow‑capped tube instead.

I noticed the second yellow‑capped tube appeared wet inside and asked why. Nurse A explained that she had just poured liquid out of it. As a result, suction was lost and blood could not be drawn. She then handed Jackson a syringe, but even that failed to produce flow.

At that point, Nurse B (short, appears pregnant) entered and stated that PRP requires blood to be drawn into a red‑capped tube, because it does not contain additives. When I asked why the procedure had started with a yellow‑capped tube and why blood had been poured from a red into a yellow tube, both nurses appeared rattled. Nurse B then contradicted herself, saying, “Yellow is fine. Yellow is the right one. I need those additives for PRP.” This sudden change in explanation made me even more suspicious and concerned.

Meanwhile, Nurse A claimed there were no more yellow tubes, Nurse B went outside the room and, within a minute, “magically” produced another yellow‑capped tube.

Finally, they switched arms and drew blood into that third yellow‑capped tube — the fourth tube used overall.

This sequence of events has left me with several pressing questions:
1.	Was my treatment still effective, given these inconsistencies?
2.	Was my blood contaminated, since it was transferred between tubes by hand — without gloves — and that plasma was later injected into my left wrist?
3.	What are the established patient safety protocols in the facility for PRP procedures?
4.	What qualifications and training are required for Registered Nurses at the facility? The apparent lack of consistency and professional handling has left me deeply concerned.
5.	Are those nurses trained to cover for one another when mistakes occur, rather than correcting errors to ensure proper patient care?

From what I’ve read, the standard of care for PRP blood collection involves using red‑capped tubes precisely because they do not contain additives that may interfere with plasma separation.

The inconsistencies in both practice and explanation — and witnessing blood being transferred between tubes bare-handed — raise serious doubts about the quality, safety, and integrity of the care I received. I left the appointment feeling uneasy and distrustful about the discipline, competency, professionalism, and trustworthiness of the clinic’s procedures.",4 days ago,2025-10-24,1,en,Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center,Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center.csv,2025-10-24,3281,0.02367965367965368,0.25792207792207794,Neutral,0.6477,0.082,0.834,0.084,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

In the middle of one of my tests the nurse had to leave because ""they need my to run over to Emergency, someone else will eventually come in here to finish your test"".  More waiting.  What a crazy place.  Avoid.  I will in the future.  Apparently they play whack-a-mole with their employees and patients.

There was terrible miscommunications between departments, no proper communication about patient health and condition. The doctors were confused and different doctors gave us different reasons for his condition. So they never treated him for the right diagnosis. Also to add the nurses in the neuro ICu was extremely rude. One nurse used words like kick you out several times to the family, even when we were crying at my brothers bedside after his death.Worst possible overall care I couldn’t have ever imagined.

83,review_8879,Victoria Kelly,1,"I’m a bit late in writing this review, but I had an appointment with Dr. Natasha Malkani at Cedars-Sinai last year, and unfortunately, it was one of the worst medical experiences I’ve ever had.

I sought out an endocrinologist to help manage a condition I had already been diagnosed with. I came to the appointment prepared—hydrated and fasting in case lab work was needed—and ready to discuss treatment options. Instead, Dr. Malkani was dismissive, rude, and uninterested in anything I had to say. After asking just a few questions, she told me she didn’t believe I had the condition I had previously been diagnosed with—without offering any alternative explanation. When I asked what she did think it might be, she simply shrugged. I asked if there were any labs we could run to get clarity, and she told me to come back in three months, offering no justification for the delay.

The entire appointment lasted less than ten minutes, yet I was billed not only for a full visit, but also for extended time. It was a deeply frustrating and disheartening experience, and I would not recommend Dr. Malkani—or Cedars-Sinai—to anyone based on this encounter.

For contrast, I recently saw an endocrinologist at UCLA who was thorough, compassionate, and genuinely interested in helping. They confirmed my original diagnosis and are now working with me to find an appropriate treatment plan.

90,review_9348,Sabrina,1,"Tanya Lyn Tivorsak I believe who seen me she was a caucasian woman tall and skinny. She lied to me about what was going on with me. She told me the imaging showed that I need to see a spinal doctor and that the pain I was feeling in my tailbone was due to my spine. She mentioned that she sees something but its nothing to worry about for now and that I should go to a spine doctor. She never looked at my tailbone or even much wanted to see me period. She had a nurse give me tylenol and a shot for pain. In which, she never mentions that I would take either. She also mentioned that I should continue to go to work and move around so my muscles wouldn’t tighten. However, she’d prescribe me muscle relaxers and pain meds. When the other nurse came with my paper work to be discharged. I believe her name to be Emily Grayson Pott she told me that Tanya Lyn didn’t prescribe me anything. So I went home still in pain for the next two days. It made me question everything because why lie to me when i’m in severe pain. I believe since I was an African American woman she didn’t want to give me proper care or attention as she did other patients that weren’t of my same race. I did go to another ER for a second opinion because the pain is very uncomfortable to where I can’t sit down properly or even bend down. The second ER told me I had a cyst in my tailbone. Which is very odd to me due to what Tanya Lyn Tivorsak mentioned to me that it was my spine. Had I not gone to a second ER then I would’ve probably never gotten the proper treatment I needed.

92,review_94350,Mikinzie Stuart,1,"This review is specifically for Nurse Gary in ER. I was waiting in observation to see a physician in a bed in the hallway. Gary told me that I would be waiting to see the physician. 2 hours later, Gary not once checked on me. Mind you, I was there for a kidney infection, and had to ask 3 different people (who kept telling me that they’d get my nurse) to finally get a water from some random woman working at one of the desks, which is important for the antibiotic I was on. And my pain was getting worse.

Thinking it was weird no one checked on me or gave me any updates, I asked again to see Nurse Gary. While I was waiting, I saw him chatting and joking with coworkers. I love that for him, liking your coworkers is important, but please check on your patients even if only to say “how ya doing? How’s your pain? Still waiting on the physician btw.” Gary finally strolls over and asks what’s up. I asked him what was going on because I hadn’t heard any sort of communication after 2 hours of laying in the hospital bed. I make it a point to be polite and pleasant with any sort of care provider because I’ve seen what kind of people they have to deal with sometimes, but he copped a condescending attitude reiterating that we were still waiting on the physician and cutting me off while I was trying to ask questions.

Meanwhile a very ill man in the bed in front of me started puking over and over again. I told Gary I was experiencing more pain but couldn’t handle the man vomiting anymore in the hallway and asked if I could leave because I was about to be sick myself. He said “yep,” not once offered to check on approximately how much longer the physician would be or to check on seeing if he could move my bed to a different hallway.

So I left without any treatment, still scared as I write this review that my kidney infection might take a turn for the worse. I have friends and family who work in ICU and ER, so I understand how difficult a job it is. But the lack of care, attention, bedside manner and empathy from Gary (on top of the man vomiting every 3 minutes) just sent me over the edge. Who knows how much longer I would be waiting for him to check on me while some guy is violently vomiting a few feet from me, and then be made to feel uncomfortable by the nurse’s attitude. It’s a joke that I got that automated text from them in the photo about caring about making me comfortable.

So if I get sepsis, that’s on you Gary. What a waste of a $150 copay, and 6+ hours of my life waiting for someone to give a hoot about my health (literally the profession you chose and get paid to do).",6 months ago,2025-05-01,1,en,Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center,Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center.csv,2025-05-01,2608,-0.06436507936507936,0.6674603174603175,Neutral,-0.9554,0.102,0.824,0.073,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

129,review_83262,Jhazzai Williams,1,"Re: Pejman D. Shamekh, MD

I came to this hospital (Cedar Sinai) located in Los Angeles, CA and I needed a liver biopsy, kidney nerve block and a possible pacemaker. They performed tests and never gave me a report of findings. I have high allergies and can only have morphine by IV and I have CHF. He kept discharging me before taking a test and immediately after tests and would not meet with me regarding results. He took me off of the morphine that works for me and replaced it with a liquid and I am having severe allergic reactions (burning all over my body,  severe pains in my abdomen, etc.). Someone said they may have stolen my morphine. The doctors have tried to discharge me 3 times and withdrew their discharge each time I appealed and said they made a mistake. I am now still in the hospital burning all over my body and doctors are ignoring me. I am Afro/Indian and by the doctors on his team's conduct, I am beginning to believe that they may have stolen my morphine and are causing racial profiling on top of that. I am suing. This doctor is very racist.

I have been waking up the past couple of days feeling like a wet mop and as if a truck has run over me, with constant bed sweating. I am also severely constipated since they substituted my Morphine with this cheap liquid under my tongue. I am constantly dizzy and it hurts for me to walk, and I didn't have these symptoms before.  I told them because I was born with severe allergies that I can't have any substitutes for my pain medicine and that the doctors who have treated me over the past 10 years have compiled a list in the medical systems as to what medications and types of medications that I cannot have that will cause me to have severe allergic reactions and it was ignored. I am still lying here very sick and again today, no doctor has checked on me to even ask what will make me better. I am still having severe allergic reactions and am very dizzy and in pain going on 3 days now and I'm still laying here with no contact from the doctor nor his team This is the second time I experienced this sort of cruel treatment in one year. The first time a real honest doctor made the registered nurses put my Morphine back in my medical treatment and rebuked them for playing the ""steal the patient's Morphine game"" because that's all I could have.",8 months ago,2025-03-02,1,en,Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center,Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center.csv,2025-03-02,2328,0.04267080745341615,0.48000000000000004,Neutral,-0.9962,0.163,0.809,0.028,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True
131,review_16402,Shannon Trotter,1,"It deeply pains me to write this review, especially considering how much I once trusted and admired Cedars-Sinai. In the past, I truly believed they had the best doctors, nurses, and care teams. When my father was tragically murdered, I felt they fought relentlessly to save him, and when I gave birth to my beautiful daughter, I was convinced I had the most capable and compassionate team by my side.

But ten years later, after moving back to Los Angeles from Orange County, the difference is staggering. It's hard to ignore how far this institution has fallen, and frankly, it’s terrifying to think that AI might soon be doing a better job than the current staff. The X-ray techs didn't secure me properly with the necessary protection, the nurses were downright lazy and dismissive, and the doctor I saw acted as if my health was more of a burden than a responsibility.

What was even more shocking was the state of the hospital itself. The bathrooms were filthy, and there was zero privacy in what they refer to as “the pit” — an area that’s uncomfortably shared with registration. It felt like I had entered a third-world country where basic healthcare was an afterthought — and yet, I’ve seen American doctors volunteering in other countries, offering better care with more compassion than what I experienced here.

This wasn’t just about a hospital being overwhelmed with patients. This was about a complete lack of professionalism, organization, sanitation, and, above all, compassion. The decline in quality care is not just noticeable — it's staggering. Many of us who were there that day felt the same way: the cold indifference from the staff, the total disregard for patient dignity, and the overall lack of accountability.

I once trusted Cedars-Sinai with my family’s health, but now I dread the thought of returning. It’s heartbreaking to witness such a dramatic decline in a place that once felt like the pinnacle of healthcare. Until major changes are made — and a true commitment to patient care is restored — I can no longer recommend this facility to anyone.

P.S. If there's anything I can do to help bring back the original culture of Cedars-Sinai, please don't hesitate to let me know. It's absolutely critical for humanity to stay connected, to feel, to care, and to demonstrate our ability to deliver with compassion and purpose. Regrettably, it seems as though your team is falling short, and it's time to reassess how we can reestablish a truly supportive and impactful culture.

If we the patients are there it's because we feel as though we need you, and we're trusting you with our health and our lives. Please do better because I know you can.

I then said you wont let me have all four sides up on the bed because it’s restraining him but you will tie him down if I’m not here.  Doesn’t make sense. They brag about these volunteers and CP and say they don’t have the man power but today I sit here and watch the CP sit at the computer desk for 80 percent of her shift. Really ! Watching on her cell phone,  And they don’t have the Coverage. Mind you I do 90% of the work during the day I changed my husband‘s diapers. I change his linens. I give him his bath. I change his bandage. All they do is come in and help me if I need them to help me turn them on his  side  all they do, and I have been doing this for  68 days 24/7.

164,review_67235,Sareen Char Kara,1,"One of the worst experiences here with Labor&Delivery, Postpartum, Anesthesia, and Birth Certificate registration departments. Staff are rude, negligent and do not respect your wishes. You will feel pressured to do a lot of things that are medically unnecessary and there is a lot of fear mongering tactics they use.

They are clueless and start stupidly asking you to make decisions that your doctor isn’t requiring. The nurses will pressure you to formula feed if your breast milk doesn’t come in soon after delivery.

The baby scales are not accurately calibrated. In turn they will send you off on a mentally challenging journey of telling you your baby is losing too much weight when it’s an inflated number to begin with because of all the IV fluids they’ve pumped you with while delivering. If you have a nurse named Leigh, ask the charge nurse to switch you. She is deceptive and will act like she’s there for you but she’s really just another crappy nurse who will pressure you to do things using the tried and true cedars method of fear monger.

The world needs to know this is NOT a baby friendly hospital because they take massive funding from formula giant Emfamil. They will force feed your child formula if need be. They are extremely pushy and a terrible hospital. Do NOT trust ever giving birth here.

Also, Providence St. John’s in Santa Monica is a better hospital especially with Anesthesia options! Cedars does not provide laughing gas which is something that would have been helpful given my circumstances. Cedars doesn’t make money off of it so they don’t offer it.

I have several OB/labor and delivery Anesthesia consults and I was told given my circumstances with my back they wouldn’t place a spinal block in a specific area and of course the attending anesthesiologist didn’t even try to look at all my back scans and Still placed it in the wrong spot. Causing me excruciating pain for 45 minutes while trying to complete the spinal block (which is 6 needles). My screams were heard all the way to the front of the Labor and Delivery unit from what the nurses told me while I was in the recovery room waiting for my postpartum room.

Lab Tech that came to my room to draw blood was extremely rude when I told her the test they’re trying to get blood from me for was already done. She got very angry and started yelling at me saying she was just doing her job when she didn’t know my chart and didn’t know I had that bloodwork done the day before!!

The people delivering food can be extremely rude when they come back to pick up your trays because you’re asking for more time! I wish I could make this part up. I was breastfeeding and I asked for more time because I wanted privacy and the woman picking up the tray Still shoved her head into my room behind the curtain and rolled her eyes when I said I need more time to eat! And she blurted out “FINE”…

Once it was time for birth certificate registration, my husband and I filled out the forms and added our child’s Suffix. The person didn’t do their job and didn’t add the suffix. And we didn’t see it on the verification letter. Later we found out the suffix needed to be added with an amended birth certificate. These people mishandled our paperwork so much. I had to push on the phone while postpartum to get a manager on the phone. Waited over an hour to get some sort of solution! Triple check everything they give you including all the fine print!!

AVOID giving birth here as much as possible!

184,review_40512,R S,1,"I have been a patient of a physician within the CS medical group for about 5 years. I have seen a continuing degradation of service from this physician and across the CS system as I have been referred out for other services. This includes a 3-4 month wait for tests which must be preceded by a consultation that typically takes a few to several weeks to secure. As  result of recent tests, I may require additional care. I had to insist on a referral to a specialist recently. That appointment took several weeks to secure. That specialist, after my urging referred me for an additional test. The results of that require a referral to another specialist and a more sophisticated test. After waiting for 2 weeks for the referral to be approved I called back to find it had not been placed in the system. That is now resolved and it took a week to connect with the specialists office who will perform this more sophisticated test. It is July 1, 2024 and I cannot see this second specialist for the required consultation which must precede the second test until October 22, 2024. None of this would have even been set in motion had I not questioned test results from February 2024. I do not know exactly where all the challenges exist. Perhaps some are staffing but the apathy exhibited by the physicians and the extremely long wait for consultations and tests are frustrating and reflect degraded service. Cedars Sinai is supposed to be one of the best medical systems in the world. Their departments, physicians and medical professionals also among the best. My experience day after day does not reflect that.

My response to CS - You are the problem. This is systemic.

Update: I submitted a comment as suggested in the owner response 6 days ago. No reply yet. It is now July 29 and there has still been no response to my online comments submitted as they suggested.

Update: It is now 8/24 and CS has still never replied to my inquiry. I recently contacted my PCP through CS Link with a question about a health issue. CS is now delighted to introduce me to CS Connect because my PCP is out today. Why does CS think they have a better idea of how a patient wants to receive care. This must be cheaper for them, cheaper for the insurance company or drive profits in some way. I continue to be disappointed and delayed in getting care from CS. They are terrible at service and customer care.

Update 11/18/24: The CS system continues to make it more difficult for patients to see their PCP. Once again I have contact my PCP regarding symptoms I am having and they are referring me to their Cedars Sinai Connect which passes me off to a separate group of service providers. I wonder why CS thinks after developing a relationship with a primary care physician a patient would want to be passed off to other professional that are unknown. They promote this as convenient and providing service...I wonder why they won't simply find a way to provide service through the PCP. I suspect this is about money.

I had collapsed twice walking out of my bathroom so my 12 year old daughter called 911. Thank God she was still awake at 1:30 am or I wouldn't be here. Laconia EMTS treated me terribly and thought I overdosed. The two men kept telling me multiple times that I need to ""stand up"" as I was crying on my kitchen floor curled up in a ball holding my head. Laconia EMTs kept asking me how much heroin I took and told me we weren't leaving till I told them how much. My son said ""My mom doesn't do drugs"". The EMTs snickered and said ""yeah ok"". I knew I was going to die in front of my children so I used every single ounce of strength that I had to get on the gourney. Yes, two men that easily had well over 50 pounds on me if not more, wouldn't place me on the gurney to get moving.
My whole stay at Mass General (all 17 days) was great. I was brought ice cream at 1 am when I couldn't sleep. Since I was bedridden, one nurse ""Grace"" even washed my hair while I was laying in the bed.
She even tried to get the knots out of my hair. She was incredible and such a sweet, caring girl.
I was moved up from the ICU to the floor above after 15 days, I was told I'd have more freedom without being hooked up to all the machines. I thought that meant I could go get a soda. I was stopped at the elevators and told I couldn't go off the floor. The woman at the desk who stopped me went out of her way and brought a soda to my room. This hospital and its staff are incredible. They saved my life as most people die before reaching the hospital. I'm incredibly grateful to be alive and the hospital staff made my ENTIRE stay more comfortable. I can't thank you all enough for all you have done for me.
Only complaint is one of the social workers. Not the one with the short curly hair..but the other one. She was so rude to my dad.

A 25-year review demonstrates that with rare exception I sought medical help elsewhere (major issues) after repeated attempts to secure them at MGH or I received sub-par services before seeking care elsewhere. MGH’s decline has become even more serious in basic every-day services as well. They can’t provide basic tests for MONTHS — something other local hospitals are providing in one WEEK!  Add to that construction traffic surrounding the Boston facility that will add 30 minutes travel time - complete gridlock. They no longer treat with doctors, instead with nursing assistants and nurse practitioners. If I wanted a less trained professional, I would go to a minute clinic. But MGH has a recruitment problem and has no doctors to treat its patients. This may sound outrageous, but I’ve heard they offer Teslas as a recruitment tool to attract talent!!!  How bad is that!!!  A total breakdown in care and they are enticing talent with a Tesla. Don’t believe the ratings - foreign countries aren’t even sending their patients to MGH any longer.

People's lives are in the balance of this system and it is nearly impossible to obtain accurate information (even recordings have inaccurate fax numbers).  I retrieved 4 different fax numbers for MGH Gastroenterology and 3 of them were inaccurate.  I had to contact Patient Advocacy to get support -- this took 3 phone calls, where with each, I was transferred at least 3 times.  How can anyone, especially someone who works in the business of people's health, think this is efficient or of high care?  I understand this is the responsibility of the Information Technology team at MGH -- I wonder if they realize the gravity of such poor design.  I also wonder if they understand the importance of training the MGH employees who have to deal with this system.  If I was a senior citizen or someone of lesser tenacity, I would never have completed my task with MGH (to get care) because of this confusing, inadequate, error-prone calling system.  Do better, MGH Information Technology. It's a shame that this phone system is the front face of all the good, talented, hardworking people who work for MGH.

May 30, 2025:  As an update, my general practitioner's office (not with the MGH system) followed all the correct procedures, following my instructions provided by MGH's website, automated messages, and even a person, and it was still inaccurate.  When they finally faxed the correct number, the intake people couldn't find the fax!  So, my GP's office sent it again with special attention to a human I finally found willing to watch for the fax. I repeat again without being hyperbolic, this system is a travesty and a risk to people's lives. How can the MGH administration stand by this system?  Do you find it reliable?  Are you proud of it?  If not, are you doing anything about it?

I also tried to use patient advocacy and called them a number of times and they did *not* at all help me achieve an outcome.  In fact, I called several times and I did not receive a reply.

I shared this story with a friend whose wife is a *doctor* at the Children's Hospital and she, too, couldn't get in touch with a specialist!

I wish I could score MGH lower than 1 star but that option is not available.
Last January I had a dermatologist at MGH remove several cancerous lesions on my body. So far so good. I started calling the Dermatology department at MGH in early October to schedule a follow up appointment in December. I was first told that my doctor had left the practice. Starting to go downhill.
I was then informed that MGH Dermatology was all booked out until JULY 2025! Nothing available for 9 months. I then contacted Brigham Hospital as they are a sister hospital and was informed that they too are booked out until July 2025. I offered to go to MGH Danvers and was told that they are also booked out until July 2025! Do you see a pattern here?
Then contacted MGH Patient Support services where a very nice gentleman told me would help. (Great!). Shortly following our conversation/e-mails, he got back with me to inform myself that there was nothing available until July 2025.
Is this any way  to run a hospital? I’m looking for a follow up appointment….not a surgical procedure.
If this doesn’t sound very suspicious I don’t know what does.
P.S. I was told by someone who works at MGH Danvers that they only had 3 doctors for the Dermatology Department and MGH has no money to hire more doctors.

I want to bring attention to a deeply concerning and inappropriate incident involving a member of the EVS crew, Karl Flowers. While at the hospital, this employee made sexual and inappropriate comments toward my underage daughter. This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, unprofessional, and predatory—especially in a hospital setting where patients and their families should feel safe.

Hospitals are meant to be places of healing and care, not environments where families have to worry about staff making offensive or harmful remarks. I strongly urge Rush Hospital administration to address this matter immediately, investigate this employee’s conduct, and ensure that appropriate actions are taken so no other patient or visitor has to go through a similar experience.

As soon as I can find out who I can call to audit this specific unit I will. I have never seen people who have so much pride and presumptuousness. Where u cannot even ask a simple question without them having a problem. Last time I checked that was part of the medical field...to answer questions, to make sure that families fully understand and to look at care on an individual basis. Meaning that you understand that what may work for one, may not work for all.

I will be filing multiple complaints, but knowing that hospitals keep issues internal and swept under the rug, a complaint within their own hospital is no where near enough. I hope the CEO sees this and knowing them it probably won't be important. But do understand that there are SEVERAL medical personnel (doctors, nurses, and front desk staff) that are not fulfilling the ideal role that you pay them for and there is a lack of consistency. They are nasty, sarcastic, and self rightous. They have to be told how to behave in regards to theraputic communication and doing-their-job, which should be concerning. Don't let that “one of the best hospitals” talk fool you. They have some disgusting behavior.

It's utterly heartbreaking that “professionals” could be that cruel in people's lowest point in life. Please by all means, don't let your loved ones be disregarded and shown a lack of sympathy. Don't let yourself be either. You have a right to be treated like a decent human being. You have a right not be told you're “receiving top notch care” to further disrespect and disregard your feelings as well as ignore their concerning behavior. Because guess what, there's always someone better. They are not the number one hospital in Illinois ladies and gentlemen, that place belongs to NORTHWESTERN.

WHAT A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!

RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL
CENTER WAS LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT!

The following information is somewhat personal but I will post it anyway because it may help someone who may need A NEW ATTITUDE about their relationship with a medical professional and practitioner.

MY DOCTOR OF 32 YEARS JUST RETIRED. THE FOLLOWING IS MY LETTER TO MY NEW DOCTOR FOLLOWING MY FIRST EXAMINATION.
****************

Greetings Dr. Moline:

Thank you for taking the time to consider my post examination overview and perspective.

On April 21, 2025, I had one of the best doctor examination and visit since my two day physical at the Great Lakes Medical Center and my physical for admission to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

“Nurse Carmen” and your wonderful staff were the major reasons why.

Dr. Moline, I found your medical practice and my physical examination to exceed my extraordinarily high expectations. Your examination was hospitable, educational, extremely professional and informative.

Your humorous delivery caught me by surprise and was a great addition to the entire experience. “You know, I like you”!

For the Record, I did have a medical interaction and event with my Lipitor Statin medication that I need to bring to your attention for memorialization.

After taking the Lipitor as directed with anticipated as advised side affects [not effects] for the first seven days I experienced mild, then more moderate symptoms of stomach aches and discomfort.

The discomfort level ranged from mild pain and all the way to like a boiler maker pre-stool expected experience.

The medication side affects notice provided adequate warning of what I was to expect!

I did stay away from grape fruit as cautioned, but I did consume an inordinate quantity and unnecessary quantity of Citrus tangerines as usual three times a day each and every day!

My stool felt like it was going to be in the form of diarrhea but to my surprise the firm and fairly normal stool literally had a splash of fresh bright red blood!

Without panic I studied the pharmacy print out for side affects. I also googled the active ingredients in Grapefruit that is found in all other Citrus fruits.

Taking myself off of all Citrus including my favorite Grapefruit flavor soda “Squirt” seemed to help and had the affect of resolving my challenge.

Due to the foregoing circumstance I elected to postpone the ColoGuard screening until later this week for Sunday. I did not want to contaminate any stool samples that would render any negative results.

I have also elected to eliminate carbs from my one meal a day weight management strategy for the next ninety days! I have scheduled my Weight Loss therapy for the first day after my upcoming visit with Carmen and her wonderful Brigade of Medical Professionals and Practitioner.

On the positive side I have an exhilarating feeling of joy and accomplishment in my body. I also believe that my tolerance for inflammation may have improved significantly or have been reduced   or eliminated all together.

Either way I believe that my “perfect ten” objective has been achieved!

Please let me know if there are any measures that I should be aware of.

Dr. Moline, thank you for your time, efforts, and professional support and consideration.

I can hardly wait for my follow up appointment in July.

The Associated Press would be impressed with my word count! HAVE A GREAT DAY!

You may use this information and memorandum in any manner that can benefit you, your staff and medical practice or my fellow patients. No Privacy Rights reserved.

MAY THE PEACE OF THE LORD CONTINUE TO GO WITH YOU!🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

The experiences in past years in RUSH keep confirming the fact that they care only about money and not much else. Multiple times providers do unnecessary procedures, resulting in massive billing later. Most of my interactions there, you feel like a customer and not a patient. And beware - billing at RUSH is times more expensive than anywhere else. MRI here is over $2300 - you can get the same done and read for $300-400. Minor manipulations that your doctor might do to you (seemingly as part of your visit) can result in - $5000-6000 bills. Be really careful at RUSH and best take yourself anywhere else. Majority of the effort at RUSH seems to be going into maximizing how much they can squeeze both from the insurance companies and you.

104,review_80227,Tammy,2,"I had a bone scan on 3/26. I’ve had multiple bone scans before, but this experience was different. A gentleman escorted me to the room where my scan would take place, but he did not mention that he was in training. There was also a woman present, but she did introduce herself, but did not explain her role.

Once the scan began, I was placed in the machine. After a few minutes, they took me out and then put me back in. When I asked what had happened, the woman said I had moved my head. However, I take these scans regularly, and I always remain still, my son was there and witnessed the entire process.

The trainee seemed confused while looking at my scan on the computer and she kept asking the other staff member questions, which became frustrating and uncomfortable for me. I wish they had explained what was going on beforehand instead of leaving me in the middle of an unclear situation.

Additionally, when the scan was over, the staff member was supposed to walk me to the exit. However, she stopped midway and just pointed out where the doors were instead. This experience felt unprofessional and left me feeling uneasy.

107,review_78828,Adriana Niva,1,"I gave birth here in 2022, it took me this long to finally leave this review. TL;DR - I was ignored and gaslit despite having no pain relief to speak of and had a horrible birth experience.

I went in to be induced (41 weeks), that experience was fine, they were fairly on top of things and I had good nurses.  All of my complaints come into play once I was moved to the active labor room.

They were supposed to help with changing positions and things to keep my labor progressing but really only one nurse said anything about it.  No one really gave consideration to my birth preferences that I shared with multiple people (such as not wanting to labor on my back which I ended up doing).  The contractions from being induced came on very strong so I decided to get an epidural.  The epidural did not work, they tried to “flood the area” to make it work but this was unsuccessful.  Other pain medication interventions that were supposed to be available (nitrous oxide and Fentanyl) were said to be unavailable due to a leak they had in the storage room and a national shortage.  I was not made aware of this until I was asking about them after, so though I was not at all prepared to, I delivered without pain medication and so many people were in and out I had to keep repeating that the epidural wasn’t working and other things like that I could not breastfeed due to my prior BMX.

Despite Rush claiming they were pro movement and pro your preferences, I was kept on my back (didn’t seem like I had a choice) and was argued with by a nurse regarding how long I wanted my son to stay attached to his umbilical cord.

3 other women went into labor at the same time as me.  The resident was very good, I really liked her I wish I remembered her name I just know she was a black woman.  I was progressing through active labor well enough (on my damn back), and then the doctor came in in a huge rush like a drill sergeant, told the resident what she was doing wasn’t helpful (even though it was to me but I was in too much pain to say anything).  She did not listen at all and was just trying to get me to push as fast as possible without listening to my body or limitations and when I was shaking and in a ton of pain she just kept repeating to hit the epidural button more and refused to listen/understand that the epidural was fully worthless to me (no matter what me or my husband or sister were telling her).  To the point where once I had given birth to my son and she was stitching me up, I could feel everything and was telling her that (I don’t believe she used any local because she still thought the epidural was working and I was being dramatic I guess).  So after wincing pretty hard at once of her stitches she said, “It is like a dull pressure?” (what you would feel with a working epidural) and I said, “No, it’s sharp and piercing, like a needle.” She got real quiet and you could just see it FINALLY sink in that I was feeling everything.

I was left with bad postpartum depression and slight panic episodes in those early days thinking back to my birth experience.",7 months ago,2025-04-01,1,en,Rush_University_Medical_Center,Rush_University_Medical_Center.csv,2025-04-01,3084,0.03446666666666669,0.48083333333333345,Neutral,-0.495,0.107,0.79,0.103,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

My mom who is 70 years old named Tosha Feliciano had two aneurysms in her aorta. So our first experience with Rush was the cardiology department which has an exceptional lineup of doctors and she was able to be paired with Dr. Michele Richard. A truly incredible surgeon that spoke to my mom with such kind love and care. She was able to repair both of those aneurysms flawlessly. To the surgery check-in staff on the fifth floor they are absolutely amazing. Vicki holds it down and absolutely has the best spirit. My mom ended up on the 12th floor and had an amazing nurse named Sara. The occupational therapy staff there is absolutely amazing. They’re on the 12th floor as well. Hospitals can be a really scary place, especially when you’re dealing with the person that you ultimately may love most. They showed her the care and love that. I feel that they would really give their family. I can’t recommend this hospital enough. We even had one of the former cardiology department heads named Anne, that made sure we also had the best care of the entire time. if your family member is having cardiology issues and is looking for a second opinion or you’re looking for a new cardiology department, I can’t recommend these doctors enough there.

My doctor, Veronica Flores, CNM, left and went home during the early hours, even though we had previously discussed which hospitals she works at so I could schedule my delivery accordingly. She had told me that at this hospital, she would be my doctor — but during labor, my doctor was changed.

The doctor who administered and inserted the epidural injection didn’t do it correctly. My right leg became numb, but it didn’t have much effect on my left leg, and I could still feel pain during my contractions. Unfortunately, I witnessed a lot of inexperience.

Dr. Deb came into my room only during the final hours of labor and kept saying that everything was going well. I asked for more epidural several times, but the nurses refused to give me any additional doses, and I was in severe pain. After enduring so much pain and difficulty, she finally told me that the baby’s head had not turned properly and that I needed a C-section — even though four hours earlier, she had told me that the baby had turned and everything was going fine.

After surgery and and ercp, I was left with an incapable nurse Nordica who read my chart to say I had a procedure in the morning so I couldn’t have any more pain meds because all the orders were for pills and the procedure required me to have nothing by mouth. I screamed in pain most of the night begging for help. My husband tried to advocate for me. Other staff came to check on me telling me to make sure I told my morning nurse my issue. Thankfully by 7am the surgical team came to check in me and were confused I was in so much pain, Thankfullu, by then I had a new nurse. Kristina came to check on me about every 45 minutes, trying to help me improve my level of pain. By noon I was finally able to eat and able to move without being so miserable. Next thing I know a nurse lead is coming to tell me I’m being discharged. I begged for the ability to stay. Asked my surgeon, ask the PT, and asks my nurse for advice.  all who recommended I stay. I cried to the nurse lead stating I just now felt stable and was afraid to go home with less meds than were available at the hospital. The Lead never gave her name and was very dismissing of my concern. My sister tried to help advocate, and then my husband. Eventually I was getting worked up and it was increasing my pain more. Thankfully another nurse came to try and help. However, a couple hours later I was told that a Dr.Dobson who I have no recollection of meeting was in charge and I had to go home, and we better hurry to the pharmacy before they close. When my husband picked up the meds I realized that the dosage was half the amount I car been given over the last couple hours. In a panic I asked again for help and was denied and further treatment. I’m a usually healthy person. I’ve only been in the hospital last to deliver my baby 21 years ago. I do my best to see my primary regularly, have labs and ensure I am taking care of myself.

Both of my surgical experiences here have been excellent, and I highly recommend the doctors at this facility. My anesthesiologist provided thorough and attentive care, especially considering my needs as a pulmonary patient awaiting a double lung transplant.
Dr. Rosen stands out as the best neurosurgeon I have encountered in Florida. His expertise, compassion, and ability to communicate in clear terms make him remarkable. Dr. Chohan, my former pulmonologist, also demonstrates outstanding knowledge and bedside manner, and both doctors receive my highest praise.
My primary care physician, Dr. Luis Barba in Orange City, is exceptional—his knowledge, skill, and genuine compassion set him apart. Dr. Bennett my pulmonologist at Fish Memorial is also fantastic, combining professional excellence with empathy for her patients. Dr. Hall, who performed my oral surgery, was communicative and caring, and his team ensured I was well-supported after the procedure.
The pulmonary rehabilitation team at AdventHealth Orlando provides thorough and encouraging support, equipping patients with tools to succeed while making everyone feel welcome.

257,review_10827,Chelsea Taylor,1,"I literally ran away from AdventHealth after what I can only describe as the worst hospital experience of my life.

I drove myself to the ER after having a really high heart rate for the past two days following a Seizure I had five days prior. I parked on the sixth floor of the parking garage and made my way down to the ER.

I arrived in the lobby for the ER at about 2:45pm, checked in and waited. The hospital was busy, but nothing crazy. I told the nurse at check in I had a high heart rate that would not go down and was recently told I have SIRS, a deadly condition if left untreated and that I recently had a seizure. They said someone would be with me. I waited for 30 minutes to be called to triage where I sat, alone, for another 45 minutes. Just as I was about to leave, the ER Dr. Donald T, comes and ask me what's the issue. I explain I have a brain stent and recently had a seizure and my heart rate will not go down.

He proceeds to tell me, ""you sure it's not a shunt"". I said, no it's a STENT, It was placed at that hospital and all of my records are with AdventHealth. His scribe points to her screen to show I have a stent. He then ask if I had been drinking or doing cocaine because that can raise your heart rate.

I did not find that funny as I don't drink because my sister died an alcoholic, he would know that if he read my chart.

He says he will run some test. He then tested me for ethanol & drugs.

I wait another 20 minutes and the nurse comes to take blood. I tell her I just was in the hospital and to avoid specific areas and that my veins are small. She makes two attempts and got a vein on the second, but blew a vein the first time.

She draws blood, & I'm told to go wait on the lobby for a room. I waited for three hours and within that time they had to redraw blood because it kept hemolyzing. By the time I'm called to the back I had been waiting for 5 hours.

I get to the back room and I'm in ER room 41. The nurse says she has to try to draw blood again because it wasn't a good draw the other times. No biggie. She draws, and it's a little uncomfortable. But she left and went on her way. As I'm sitting in the room my respiratory rate is dropping - remember I have a documented case of SIRS and it could lead to organ failure if not treated.

My respiratory monitor goes off for five minutes and no one came in.  I forgot to mention I have asthma and they know that because it's in my chart.

I'm frustrated at this point at the lack of care. But then I feel my IV starts to have a sudden pain. It hurts to touch, which can be a sign of a blood clot. I call for the nurse she comes about 20 minutes later and says, ""oh yea I'll have to leave it in and get someone to give you a new IV.""

She walks out and in that moment I made the decision to disconnect myself and leave. I left with IV in arm, my aunts a nurse my mom's a CNA, and I have plenty of friends who work on the medical field who can help me take it out.
I grab my backpack, overnight bag, and put on my sweater. I walk out the door and pass a nurse who said, ""are you leaving?"" And I say, ""I'm not staying somewhere that treats me like an after thought"".

I continue my walk from the ER room, through the lobby, passed cops and security, up two flights of stairs, though the conference area, to the elevator, get off at the 3rd floor to take the bridge to the garage, and from there get on the next elevator to the 6th floor of the parking garage. I passed hundreds of cameras, several staff members and that was it. If it weren't for my insurance restricting me to AdventHealth I would go anywhere else.

After three years of countless stays, they still don't know what's killing me. I've told them it's the brain stent they insisted on. Three years of just straight incompetence. I have given them so much grace. I've never insulted or cursed at anyone, yelled or mistreated anyone, but this was my final straw. As soon as I can I'm changing my insurance because AdventHealth, does not care about your health. They'll keep you for days with no care plan just to bill your insurance.",a month ago,2025-09-28,1,en,AdventHealth_Orlando,AdventHealth_Orlando.csv,2025-09-28,4093,-0.048654882154882145,0.3538540965207632,Neutral,-0.6624,0.077,0.855,0.069,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

The minute he walked into the exam room, I just knew immediately that I had made the right decision. He was so friendly, nice, caring and answered all my questions. His office was absolutely beautiful and his staff was so nice.I only waited in the lobby less than 5 minutes.  My surgery was performed Friday August 8th. At the Advent Women's Tower. The building at 5 am was breathtaking with the blue lights. Everyone was so helpful guiding us to the Surgery center on 2nd floor. The receptionist, security ,the nurses, the anesthesiologist ""3 of them"" calmed me and helped me to relax before my surgery. Dr. James Mayo came in and marked my face for the correct side and asked if I had any questions. Surgery went great, even though knowing my face might have scars, I felt Blessed. Dr. James Mayo got all the Skin Cancer and Although it was very close to my eye, I could see. That was my main concern of losing my eyesight. I lost my left eye to Melanoma in 1998.  I was very self conscious of how my face looked being rolled through the hospital lobby. The kind Gentleman pushing my wheelchair gave me a towel to cover my face. He kept telling me that I was beautiful and not to let the scars on my face define me. God Bless this man. Wish i I knew his name. It's been 4 days and my face has healed very nicely. Dr James Mayo did an excellent job. I highly recommend him to anyone needing plastic Surgery. In a month or so I don't think the scars will hardly be noticeable.

While I was getting set up for my MRI the technician told me they’ll look at my nerves, my organs, bones etc to hopefully get some answers after getting 4 ultrasounds, an X-ray and CT scan and not getting any results and being in tremendous pain but upon the results all he looked at was my soft tissue and another organ. Nothing about my nerves, bones or anything. It’s clear he just rushed through my MRI results. So still no answers and might have to fight for another MRI where the radiologist will actually do his job! Never been a fan of advent health physicians, radiologist for this exact reason.

Stop in to the ER here at Advent.
From the poking and prodding like you are a piece of cattle being ran though every machine they can charge your insurance for, to the horrible hospital food that keeps you sick in the first place, this place is a joke.

Why people continue to support this broken and failed medical system is beyond me.
You will be put through a million test, draw blood so many times it starts blowing veins out, all for what!? Take two of these and call me in the morning!?...
What happened to doctors doing more then letting techs run a gauntlet of test all to not fix the problem, they are not trained to heal, only to treat with Synthetic drugs, this system will only keep you sick.
If you value your time, your health, and sanity, avoid at all cost.

And lastly, if you get admitted into the ""Emergency Room"", that should warrant an emergency response.
Waiting two days to see a doctor and being starved the entire time to run test is more of a torture tactic than it Is a way to treat someone who is sick (and pregnant I might add).

497,review_14649,Johanna Acevedo,1,"Unfortunately horrible. My mother was wrongfully discharged twice. The first time on 7/20/2025 PT said she needed a rehab or 24/he home care. I am from New Jersey so it was a little more challenging for the case manager, so they discharged her without approving the rehab or services and told me I could go back to Jersey and they’d give me the referral. Well, she had another seizure and was admitted again 2 days later on 7/22/2025. She was discharged yesterday 8/1/2025. I found her a rehab in New Jersey that accepted her and was going to take her to all her chemo and radiation treatments, all they needed was the hospital (Adment Health Orlando) to get the approvals. Well they called me and said that I had been discharged without the case manager knowing and that they could now not give any approvals because she is not a patient. They discharged her without approving rehab or home care with her answering cognitive questions wrong, calling her hand a foot,obviously not ok to be alone, as ok to be alone and washed there hands two time and when I told the case manager that was patient neglegiance she said she was sorry and for me to go back to the ER to have her readmitted and charge the insurance even more money after hour 14 day stay to get the paperwork so she could be safely getting the nessary treatment! Isn’t that insurance fraud! She needs an approval for the rehab not to be seen again in ER, they had  “medically cleared her” the day prior. The reason we were still there was because the case manager was working with New Jersey rehab so I could take her right after the flight. I am going straight to a lawyer when we get home! Patient negligence, discharging my mom as if she could function by herself, when she can’t even talk and nothing for me to even be able to get her help, the paperwork doesn’t even provide anything for my job to even give me FMLA to be with my mom. Our experience was complete horrible on the Neuro floor. The ICU, 11th floor was very attentive and informative. The Woman’s side 10th floor also very nice and attentive. Ginsberg floor 1-th neuro, horrible! My mom was vomitting all over, I was freaking out calling the nurse, I hit the button  three times and they would say ok someone’s coming and no one would come. Shannon was very overwhelmed and I guess I experienced, I felt like I couldn’t leave the room. One specific nurse Katie was amazing! She most be from a different area! She was attentive, checked on my mom regularly even with my presence and would update me and reassure me! The case managers when the my were absolutely useless and should be in another business not with as assistance to patients because they were worthless with discharge planning both times she was discharged!!!!!! I will be seeking legal assistance, because I don’t want them to do these to anyone else and god forgive someone dies for there negligence!!!!!",2 months ago,2025-08-29,1,en,AdventHealth_Orlando,AdventHealth_Orlando.csv,2025-08-29,2900,0.10247266893262989,0.5389901764901764,Positive,0.9167,0.068,0.834,0.098,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

Florida Hospital Orlando should be ashamed of posting so many billboards, touting itself the best of everything when they cannot even demonstrate in an acute setting, more than a token or modicum of compassion, much less, skill in the health sciences.  Heck-- they DON'T even CARE HOW BAD, CARELESS, or how UNPROFESSIONAL their behavior was in their ER. From male nurses playing basketball with their trash into cans, to NO offers of warm blankets or comfort measures, unless my friend who accompanied me, requested these.  Once, when I aspirated a large dry Tylenol pill, which miraculously I was able to expel [eventually] by self Heimlich while my friend, the wife of another physician, made a scene at the nurses station, or in some measure, INSISTED on your personnel coming to tend me or a need of mine.  Horrible.  But, by Yirmayahu's (the navi, the prophet, Jeremiah's) words, you have forgotten how to blush."" However, it is probable that you never knew how.
By the way, adopting ""Advent Health"" instead of your real name, Florida Hospital, does NOT bring you into ANY valid simile of ""Like the Mayo Clinic."" I trained as a surgeon at The Mayo Clinic in the 1980's into the early 1990's-- you will NEVER be ANYthing like the precious Mayo Clinic.  As is the case of your innumerable Orlando area billboards, JUST because you profess something on a billboard, does NOT mean you will ever be what you declare.

528,review_19482,Kelsey Grigson,1,"I’ve been a patient of AdventHealth for close to 5 years (endocrinology, urgent care visits, labor & delivery, postpartum care) and I have never been more disappointed or disgusted in a hospital experience. I arrived via ambulance around 3am with what I thought was extreme and concerning chest pains. After 3 hours, my husband was able to finally convince a nurse to come check on me. She claimed that no one knew I was in the room (even though bloodwork had already been drawn and an IV placed) because I didn’t check in at the front desk. We explained I got there by an ambulance and her response was “oh, well this is embarrassing”. She continued to have zero sense of interest or urgency. By this time, day shift arrived and took over - thank God.

Flash forward I had to get emergency surgery to have my gallbladder removed. Up until I spoke with the head surgeon after surgery, every doctor/surgeon had the same story - as long as I reacted well after surgery, I’d be discharged by the evening. However that’s not what happened. The head surgeon refused to discharge me because he was afraid I would try taking care of my child because, as he said to my husband, “you know how woman are”. In my opinion, that’s such a lame, lazy and unprofessional excuse to keep someone so you can charge them an overnight hospital fee - which we all know isn’t even close to cheap! I absolutely respect and understand having the appropriate rest after a surgery, and that was the only thing on my agenda. Between his tone and side comments, it was clear this surgeon was only interested in the profit he could benefit from. Multiple nurses expressed they didn’t understand why I was being told I needed to stay because there was nothing indicating I needed to.

It was described to me that this was a serious and emergency situation and I got surgery took just in time. How anyone in a professional setting, especially a hospital, is so comfortable treating and speaking to their patient this way is beyond alarming.

Almost like a heart attack. They left my daughter in there and didn’t let her know exactly what was happening in which they should’ve done that.After the procedure they took me to do a catscan in which they took me to a room to wait with four other people. Everyone was gone, my family was worried on where I was and why I was taking long. 2 hours passed and I was still in that room with no one .

He grabbed a pen and marked my leg where they were going to do the surgery and he never asked if he could. He just grabbed and marked it very rough. After surgery all the nurses I had only came in to check on me once rarely twice everyday. In which that should never be especially since the doctors said I was pre diabetic. Almost all the nurses I had were very rude and very grumpy. I had a terrible experience there. I called them so they can come help me use the restroom. Called again no one came. My sick self after surgery had to get up myself and use the restroom. The cleaners didn’t even come and clean the room. They only grabbed and changed the trash. They seat in the shower was old and rusty. The bed sheets were stained and had a very nasty odor. They didn’t give me my meds every 4 hours. The nurses were very unprofessional and unorganized.

547,review_24173,Xochilt A,1,"I would leave no stars on this location. I came to the ER presenting with stomach related issues while I was on vacation. I ended up running for my life away from this place after they drugged me with a droperidol, a drug that has been banned from most hospitals across the country for its side effects. They didn’t tell me what they were giving me, or the risks or side effects. Nothing! I’ve since learned that they gave me a medication used for combative patients or for sedating just before a operation.
I was in and out of consciousness and when I would wake up, I would tell the next hospital worker that I didn’t like the medication and that I was afraid and I didn’t know how I would manage to get to my hotel. They didn’t help me or care no matter how much I tried to advocate for myself. I self checked out because I was afraid for my life and had to leave in a uber in the middle of the night, as a woman in an unfamiliar state and in and out of consciousness. I kept praying for God to help me to get to my hotel safely and I kept thinking about my family as I was in and out of consciousness from my uber. With Gods grace I made it to my hotel safely.
I then spent more than 12 hours with severe side affects from this medication that drove me to medical attention for my heart racing. Needing to throw ice water on my back, chest face to avoid passing out. Keeping my feet on the floor and needing to move from avoiding passing out. I’ve traveled back to my home state and now meeting with doctors and therapist because of what’s happened at this hospital. Please do not come to this hospital. Please do not come to this hospital.

Then after Xray in rom they realized tube was NOT placed correctly and was of NO USE.  Day 6 no food. Next morning swallow xray test and it was determined I could have food and oral meds, therefore tube was useless. Att this point I asked again to speak to GI Dr. who was in charge of my case.
No luck. Finally after contacting legal they sent a young lady to try and contact a GI Dr. After 9 hours they sent an ARNP who said she was on GI team.

635,review_9777,Paden Wallace,5,"I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Justin Beyer. From the moment he walked into the ER room, he was professional, compassionate, and incredibly knowledgeable. My daughter was feeling scared and unwell, but Dr. Beyer’s calm and welcoming demeanor immediately helped put both of us at ease.

He took the time to truly listen—not just to my daughter’s symptoms, but to our concerns as parents—and he explained everything in a way that was clear and reassuring. It was evident that he genuinely cared about her well-being, going above and beyond to ensure we felt heard and supported every step of the way.

643,review_34053,hannah gobin,1,"Please take a second to read if you are considering going here. I went here for an emergency room visit and the workers were very unprofessional. It took over four tries to even get the IV into my arm which then the medical staff failed to even attach the IV fluids to the needle in my arm. They even left the IV fluid bag on the FLOOR, absolute incompetence and unacceptable. The amount of times I was stabbed with a needle and the level of poor quality left me with a bruise that has lasted up to three weeks and I’m still waiting for it to fade. Before even treating me, they asked for my citizenship status which I have never dealt with in a hospital before as I was born in America. I went into the emergency room for a severe deathly allergic reaction and I felt as though the professionals lacked a level of cognitive function or empathy in general, and they acted as if my situation were casual. The nurse who was unsuccessful with placing my IV postponed my treatment to talk to a coworker who was leaving about her lunch… seriously? Thank God I had used my epipen on myself beforehand because I could not imagine my life being in the hands of the so-called “professionals” in the AdventHealth emergency room of Orlando, FL. I wondered why the ER was so empty, but it makes sense as that ER facility would hardly fall as people’s choice. Interesting to see where the priorities of these “professionals” lie. Unfortunately the American healthcare system is broken, but I believe AdventHealth does not try their hardest to give patients proper care and treatment. Avoid this hospital if you can.

I specifically asked for the earliest appointment which was 730am, and arrived 30 minutes early as they requested, then the tech couldn't start on time. When she did start placing the monitor s on my chest, she did not do it right and had to subject me to a second radiation exposure due to her ineptness.

The nurses had just changed shifts, which is exactly when extra attention should be given, especially with a vulnerable pediatric cancer patient. But somehow, no one noticed the infiltration, and no one took accountability.

Because of their negligence, my daughter ended up being hospitalized again, this time with an infection from the port. She had to suffer more pain, more fear, and more procedures all because the staff failed to do their job.

What’s worse? There was no apology, no explanation, and no disciplinary action toward the nurses who overlooked the issue. It’s clear that patient safety is not their top priority, and that the team is either too overworked, poorly trained, or dangerously careless.

This experience has destroyed any trust we had in Advent Health’s oncology care. We put our daughter’s life in their hands, and they failed her.

The hospital campus is beautiful, and the staff is incredible.

The transportation team was so friendly, and the food services team came every day to make sure I got the kind of food I wanted.

Dianni and the rest of the nursing staff were so nice — and, even more importantly, great advocates for me with the doctors. This was huge for me, as I was loopy, tired, and hurting after surgery.

Melissa from the physical therapy team should get a raise and a half. She was so kind and helpful. She gave great advice and helped me start moving on my own very quickly!

The physician team was incredible! I had a doctor in every day to update me on my progress and answer my questions. They actually spent time listening and thoroughly explaining my condition — I was blown away. I’ve never had another experience like that before.

Dr. Sookhoo and Nurse Practitioner Guambo deserve special mention. Each took time to explain the procedure and the recovery process going forward. I received a nerve block that meant my post-operative pain was essentially zero. The procedure seems to have gone well, and I am very appreciative of Dr. Sookhoo for putting in the extra work needed to ensure a good recovery.

Im not being listened to or helped by my surgeon or his team. DR. Richard Klien- Oncologist Reconstruction. Women are still being asked to tolerare ungodly amounts of pain with little to no support and ignored or treated like drug seekers when we ask for proper pain management that is individualulaized and not cookie cutter protocol that ends up traumatizing the indivdual person.
I left my first post op check up trembling in pain with zero information about how my surgery went and any further post op instructions.
This office looks and feels nice on the outside pre- surgery, but when your trapped after a double masectomy and expanders in your chest and no proper support for pain management you start to see the truth that this place is truly just one more nightmare Healthcare practice apart of the system that continues to ignore patients.
Im in bed trembling to write this cause pain is severe and I have nothing that actually helps me.
I made it clear along the whole pre surgery process that ive been traumatized by the medical community my whole life and they proceeded to be one more trauma for me to endure.
Even my back is in allot of pain where they did the nerve block. I shouldn't of felt any of that before or after the going out for the surgery.
Im told by Dr. Kliens staff that if its that bad, go to the ER as if I havent been through enough.
Im just here at home lost on what to do, in ungodly pain, avoiding the ER cause they'll just make it worse. They always do. And I get the stressful task of looking for a oncologist reconstruction surgeon who can better support me through my expansion process and implant surgery so Im not suffering in pain or stress or distrust at any time.

To my pre-op nurses Aurelia R. Joe B. Melody A. William Bristol thank you for being incredibly kind, patient, and compassionate. You didn’t just care for me medically, you also comforted me emotionally. You understood my fears, especially when I was overwhelmed and in tears. Your gentle words reminding me that I was in good hands with one of the best doctors meant more than you know. No matter how many times I asked questions or needed help, you never once made me feel like a burden. Your patience and attentiveness truly stood out.

To Dr. Robert Holloway thank you, sir, from the bottom of my heart. I’m so grateful that Dr. Gyang referred me to you. Your calm presence, kindness, and compassion gave me so much peace. You took the time to listen and never made me feel rushed or intimidated to speak up about my concerns. You gave me hope when I needed it most, and your reassurance helped ease my worried heart.

And to all the staff, my surgical team, and my anesthesiologist, thank you for taking such good care of me. You made me feel safe, supported, and truly cared for. I knew I was in good hands with an exceptional team.

737,review_45888,Dawn Brito,1,"I am deeply disappointed and heartbroken by the level of care my grandmother has received during her extended stay at this hospital. She was admitted back in December for swelling in her ankles—a condition that should have been treated with urgency, compassion, and appropriate medical attention. Instead, she has been shuffled around the hospital from room to room, treated more like a case number than a human being.
Over the months, her condition has dramatically worsened. She has developed several wounds during her stay, one of which was caused directly by the hospital staff. Shockingly, instead of addressing the wound with proper medical treatment, it was covered up with a bag—a clear act of neglect and an attempt to hide the injury rather than heal it. This is not just unprofessional—it’s inhumane.
What’s even more upsetting is that my grandmother walked into the hospital on her own, able to move and advocate for herself. Now, after months in their care, she is suffering not only from her original condition but also from new complications that could have been prevented. The lack of proper wound care, delays in treatment, and overall disregard for her well-being are unacceptable.
Our family trusted this facility to care for someone we love dearly, and they have failed her at every turn. No patient—especially an elderly woman—should be subjected to such prolonged mistreatment and neglect. We are now forced to explore further options, including filing a formal complaint and seeking legal counsel if necessary.
To any family considering this hospital for your loved one’s care: Please think twice.

Secondly, I will never use the call button if I ""ever""go back.  The nurses made me fee like I was aggravating them when I used it, and half of the time they never showed up.

I don't have anything more to say other than, more care and real concerned is needed at Princeton. Lack of communication was also an issue.

914,review_12812,Mattison Meury,1,"We were referred to AdventHealth for an ultrasound on our 6-week-old son’s head. We were told this was the only location that could perform pediatric head ultrasounds. After our experience, I genuinely don’t understand why. Nothing about this facility or staff was prepared for an infant.

We waited over 30 minutes past our scheduled time, which is hard enough with a newborn. The moment we were brought back, the situation became unacceptable. The ultrasound tech was rude, cold, and clearly irritated by our son’s cries. There was no pediatric bed or support. Just an adult table where we were told we could not hold him. Instead, we had to restrain his arms and hold his head straight while she slowly and forcefully pressed the probe against his soft skull.

Our baby was screaming in distress, and rather than show any empathy, the tech became more frustrated. When we explained that he doesn’t take to a pacifier, she offered to go find a hospital one anyway. Not to comfort him, just to silence him.

By the end of the procedure, our son was drenched in sweat, his face was beet red, and his screams had become so intense that no sound was even coming out. Not once did the tech pause to check on him or us. She didn’t even offer a towel to clean the gel off his head afterwards.

This was a traumatizing experience for our baby and for us as first-time parents. I cannot believe we were directed here under the assumption this was a pediatric-appropriate radiology facility.

He drank 4oz and she gave us 4oz more to go just in case. And when we were discharged and went outside I looked at the package and found out the expiration date. I should’ve gone back and showed them and talked to a supervisor, but I didn’t because I was so stressed and overtired that day. And I really regretted it!
So to all the moms out there, please! Please always check what they give you to your children, ask for expiration dates of all the medicine the nurses bring if it’s out of the package!

1123,review_28309,Monica Rodriguez Ojeda,1,"Terrible Experience – Would Not Recommend This Hospital

I have a family member who was originally admitted to the 10th floor (Orthopedic Unit). According to a nurse from that floor, her blood pressure went up, so they decided to move her to the ICU. Once she arrived at the ICU, they stabilized her within 30 minutes and told us there was no longer any need for ICU-level care. We requested that she be moved back to the 10th floor, especially since the care she received there was excellent.

We were told there were no available beds on that floor, but that she would be moved back as soon as one opened up. It’s now Monday—three days later—and she’s still stuck in the ICU unnecessarily.

The care in the ICU has been absolutely unacceptable. We’ve had to be there constantly because the staff has been so incompetent. One night, no one even brought her dinner. We had to look for a nurse ourselves and even help change her because she had been left in a soiled diaper. This morning, we arrived early and found her awake, without a diaper, and she hadn’t eaten. They had left breakfast at her bedside, even though she can’t get up on her own.

Her heart rate was at 200, and there was no staff anywhere nearby. We had to call a nurse from another hallway to get help.

This experience has been truly horrible. I would strongly advise against bringing your loved ones to this hospital. They are not attentive, and the level of care is completely unacceptable.",4 months ago,2025-06-30,1,en,AdventHealth_Orlando,AdventHealth_Orlando.csv,2025-06-30,1462,0.017916666666666657,0.5891666666666666,Neutral,0.7587,0.113,0.759,0.128,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

It wasn't till 3 pm when I went to the desk to find out what was wrong, they didn't know someone would come out to talk to me. It was after 4 pm when someone came out to talk to me.    Better communication needs to be handled in this type of procedure.    A heart procedure should be taken with care,   if there's an emergency someone needs to immediately come out to talk, it was already a stressful day for me.

If he had been told that one shot and my morphine would have worked perfectly. I was coming out of the anesthesia and was in no shape to communicate much that was coherent except for my pain. Once I was aware enough and communicated what needed to be to be done and a head nurse heard me things started to turn around. They did finally get ahead of my pain and for the rest of the stay I could tell what an outstanding facility this is. The staff must be hand picked and extremely well trained. The nurses that provided for my care were nothing short of incredible. Each one a consummate professional and seriously caring individuals.

The only complaint and concern that I did have was it on arrival while checking in I was informed that I had a almost $1000 balance for the procedure. I was not informed of this prior to arriving at the facility. I was informed the day prior by the doctors office that I had a balance with them however, this was just for the position Fee and not for use of the hospital and any additional services necessary for the procedure. The amount of money is pretty significant and to not be made aware of this prior to going to the appointment was pretty significant and feel that this is something that definitely should be addressed ahead of time as not everybody is able to agree to this type of commitment and may have declined the procedure after already taking time off of work and school to have it done.",5 months ago,2025-05-31,1,en,AdventHealth_Orlando,AdventHealth_Orlando.csv,2025-05-31,1548,0.18530864197530866,0.48703703703703705,Positive,0.9575,0.052,0.831,0.118,Positive,Neutral (3★),False,False

1292,review_40919,Juliana Ingram,2,"I came to the Advent Health Hospital ED on Rollins St. in Orlando on 4 separate occasions over a period of 7 months. I have been suffering from dizziness, tinnitus in both ears, ear pressure, head pressure, pain on the top of my head, and visual disturbances. I stayed in the hospital observation floor twice. I had tests but no one could tell me what was wrong. They sent me home just as sick as I was when I came in. No answers, no treatment. I came to the ED the third time. I had the same symptoms yet they didn't even put me in a room where I could lie down. I sat in a chair in a tiny room. The doctor gave me an EKG and sent me home with a prescription for a very low dose of Valium. It didn't work. I just came back to the ED for the 4th time last week. In addition to all of the dizziness and other symptoms, I had Sepsis, severe dehydration, and an asthma attack so bad I couldn't breathe. They admitted me but the hospital was full so I had to stay overnight in the ED to wait for a room. They finally got a room so I was waiting to go upstairs. A doctor suddenly came in my room and told me I was being discharged! They never even waited a few days until my blood cultures came back! I had more tests done for the dizziness but still they had no answers for me. I needed to see a neurologist. I was told one would come see me. Instead they sent me internal medicine doctors. I never got to see a neurologist. So again I was sent home sick with no answers. I have to wait another 3 weeks to see a neurologist in Ocoee. I think it sucks that no one would take more time to give me a diagnosis. Instead they sent me home time and time again.

1401,review_36028,Lisa Giampapa,1,"Very unsafe environment for your loved ones!! Do not I repeat do not leave them unattended if they can not speak for them selves

My daughter suffered an aneurysm and was heavily sedated on a vent so far  for 3+weeks

They are severely understaffed and have one nurse for 2 patients
But being neuro icu the patients are very high maintenance and many times if I need the nurse they are away from the station with the other patient.  Many times the situation is urgent i.e. the ventilator is alarming. The patient is agitated and needing assistance, keeping her from jumping out of the bed or pulling her tubes.

The fix to a lot of these nurses is to medicate or splint  their hands and add mittens

Why there is not patient care tech  assigned to this floor is beyond me. These nurses are very, very stretched and facing very severe burnout, which I’m sure leads to judgment issues.

Advent
health really needs to get their act together

The sink in the bathroom leaks and does not work properly. The guest bathroom next to the waiting room has mold in the toilet. The guest waiting area is ice machine and water machine does not work.

The first week I was here I had two issues with two separate nurses and they were actually infection risk issues and after having to make several phone calls, we were told that they wanted to earn our trust back and would only give us the best nursing care and that lasted for about three days then we got reassigned a nurse we had a concern about.  Every time my daughter makes progress we have a bad staffing day where she is not tended to appropriately and she suffers some sort of set back

She has pneumonia for the 3rd time since admission

The doctors change weekly and they all have a different approach and differences in focus of importance

Their lack of compassion for family members is shameful

There is no way I could ever leave my daughter alone and be safe from falling out of bed or extubations ( which has already happened) so as a result I have been essentially living here

I was told it was against policy for me to get a guest tray so I have even gone days without eating because it was unsafe for me to leave her side.  I have taken several photos of her hanging off the bed and no one is around.  I will be reporting this to cms as well

1442,review_98927,Fidel Carter,4,"My dialysis catheter fell out of my chest 5 days after I had it ""retunneled"". I sat up to eat breakfast and found the catheter in my hands with the two pins that enter the heart right there. My undershirt was blotcjed with blood. I called the ambulance and realized my cough the night befire was probably from the catheter dislodging. There was blood in my lungs and I had to have a new catheter placed.
I was pleased with the service I received at Advent Health this time. The medicine doctor was exceptional. He had the bedside manner of an era long forgotten. There's hope in the darkness of the kiling fields of iotrophic medicine. As a Dialysis patient i watch and sometimes hear people die in hospital, including twice at Advent Health. Once in the basement during dialysis and once inbrhe ICU. I've been close ( to dying) myself, About 5 times. There has to be a better way.
Transplants with bone marrow are the best surgical solution. That way you don't need toxic antirejection meds. I got a transplant at Florida Hospital aka Advent Health in 2015 after 4 years on peritoneal Dialysis.  In 30 days the Tacrolymus levels never rose to the level they wanted. Instead of realizing I needed an alternative, doctor Cyril Kouriakus raised the prescription until I was taking 12 in the morning and 12 in the evening.  Keep in mind that the side effect of Tacrolimus is kidney damage.
That's right.  You get a kidney transplant, and the medicine destroys what little function you have left. Yeah. I was able to pee before the transplant, but not afterwards. That means swolen legs, edema, including pulmonary aka potentially drowning in my fluids in my sleep. Pericarditis. Several liters of fluid in the sack around my heart was drained over the course of three days. The procedure looked like a coffee strw sticking out of my chest.  I lost 45 pounds in 45 days in the process. Like I said, I have faced death several times over the years as a victim of the system.
To prevent the pericarditis from returning, I was prescribed Colchicine. Yeah. Bad idea. Colchicine caused splenomegaly and low platelets in my blood. The result was a bout with death,  closer than ever before in June and July of 2024. The Colchicine was stopped and I started taking B12 in high doses. It was a Naturalpathic healer that gave the knowledge for me to heal. My loving wife found her. Keep in mind, I had 7 blood and platelet transfusions first.  All while bleeding from the sinuses and several small wounds including acne on my face and a scratch on my leg from my new puppy. I was Neutropenic. That hospital stay was at ORMC.",5 months ago,2025-05-31,1,en,AdventHealth_Orlando,AdventHealth_Orlando.csv,2025-05-31,2611,0.13833290043290045,0.4638207792207792,Positive,-0.2023,0.072,0.858,0.07,Negative,Positive (4-5★),True,False

The care was worse than any third world country. I had been on a clear liquid diet and fasting for a couple days prior, and was also vomiting…it took them until the day after the procedure, to even start me on IV fluids which is standard of care, and similar amount of time to get orders for nausea and pain meds (never even given in recovery) I lost 12 lbs in a week and now having issues with my blood pressure, all related to this. For clarification, usually I’m in the hospital two-three days post op, and basically back to 💯.

My room, 8225, was filthy. The toilet seat was broken off. Every time I had to go a had to balance my sick self so I wouldn’t fall off, there was a full container of OLD urine that has been left in a suction container, there was a SPRAY of BLOOD 🩸 OR FECES 💩 across ALL the ceiling tiles from one wall to the other. I had SEVERAL nurses who mishandled my IVs & the night nurse wouldn’t report it or do anything with it when I asked & passed it off to the day nurse who ALSO ignored it then left for 5 HOURS before I saw her again once THREE other nurses came in to place a new IV. I went through five IVs in 10 days. I was stuck 27 times not including daily blood draws. I have been in other areas of the hospital, whether there is not a breath of problem from the rooms or the staff or the nurses. I felt very neglected and even improperly medicated. When I was given my pain medication, I was given another medication that knocked me out and I was unresponsive and the nurses told me they were going to have to do a “sternum rub “ on me to try to get me to be responsive. I ended up leaving sooner than I should have because I felt scared after all of that had happened to me, and I feel like I am still recuperating at home when I should still be in the hospital. My doctors were amazing as always, but everything else was a great big giant awful experience that I’ve never experienced there before.

Makes suggestions to what to look for and the next steps to take for your health needs. When I first went to the Hospital needed a liver transplant 2.5 yes ago.

1649,review_12206,Alyssa Lakey,1,"Don’t let the glowing reviews fool you - this hospital is rife with incompetence. I went here while I was on vacation and having difficulty swallowing. I went in around 5 pm the first evening, they said in order to do a scope, I would have to stay overnight to “hold my place in line”. The ER doctor - Dr. Jerry - said they would “definitely” get me in the next day. They couldn’t give me a quote on how much it would cost because “Blue Cross Blue Shield (who I am insured under) always gives them fits on Sundays” for estimates. I decided to stay because it had been two days since I’d eaten solid food and I was struggling even with liquids, which was more concerning, otherwise I wouldn’t have gone at all.

They finally got me into a room, and my night nurse told me they would get me in first thing in the morning for a scope. Apparently, she was mistaken. The day nurse informed me that the doctors had 24 hours to respond to an order. Once again - I don’t live there, and I also didn’t want to stay two nights in a hospital because it’s going to be ridiculously expensive.

In the morning, someone brings me food - juice and jello. I didn’t touch it because even with my limited medical knowledge, I know that the usual protocol is no food and drink for 8ish hours before anesthesia. The nurse came in and asked if I’d been able to eat AND gave me a stool softener in juice (that I did not express a need for). It felt like a prompt, so I tried. I stupidly trusted that they knew what was best as it is their literal job. I didn’t have much (obviously, as I was struggling with swallowing) - a few sips of apple juice and probably less than a teaspoon of jello. I figured maybe since it was clear liquids it must be okay, and they wouldn’t be offering it to me if I wasn’t supposed to have it, right?

My grandmother called the charge nurse to check in on things because she was concerned for me being there all by myself, and after that, THEN they told me not to take anything else by mouth. EVERYONE that interacted with my care verbally acknowledged & knew that the plan was for me to be scoped from the minute I got there, and yet they allowed food to be delivered to me. They said they couldn’t scope me after that as I was an aspiration risk. My GI doctor when I got back home said for clear liquids, they only would’ve had to wait 4 hours, and I’d stopped ingesting anything around noon.

And on top of that, the day nurse almost gave me blood thinners because a vial had been left on his cart before he asked where they usually give it to me and I said they didn’t. He said “oh, they must have just ordered it”, (for an ENDOSCOPY? And when all my blood work looked normal?) and then looked at my profile and realized it wasn’t for me. He also advised that I shouldn’t take so many tums because it would give me osteoporosis, which is wild, considering a) I wasn’t taking them and hadn’t indicated such, and b) even if I had been, I was now here for the reason that I COULDN’T SWALLOW WELL. I think I would take my chances with osteoporosis over being unable to swallow.

I consider myself a pretty reasonable person - I do understand that hospitals are busy, and more severe situations take precedence. I wasn’t asking to be treated like a priority, just simply for clearer, more honest communication, so that I could have measured expectations and made decisions accordingly. I wasted time there that I could have been spending with the people I was on vacation with, or simply gotten an earlier flight home to be seen, which is what I ended up doing after it was all said and done.

Every single person that interacted with my care failed miserably at their jobs, but a special shoutout to Nurse Jan Michael, and the nurse over the observation unit whose name I didn’t catch (a white woman with cornrows) for being extra terrible.",6 months ago,2025-05-01,1,en,AdventHealth_Orlando,AdventHealth_Orlando.csv,2025-05-01,3847,0.03925364758698092,0.40747354497354504,Neutral,-0.3727,0.046,0.911,0.043,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

1652,review_64758,Lynda,1,"Advent Health Orlando is The Worse and Incompetent Hosptial and Incompetent LVAD does not help the heart and their Surgery Room is also incompetent for Left Ventricle Patient is The Worse Care that I have ever been at and Seen for My Dad Robert Leavy who was their Patient at this Hosptial had the worse care ever and he Lost his Life on the LVAD Device due to negligence at The Ginsberg Tower there and also due to the negligence of his Surgeon Dr. Scott Silvestry who does not work there anymore Never seen him after LVAD Surgery to get him the care he needed to live. My Dad's LVAD Team did not help him with his serious health issues. No one wanted to help My Dad Live and get better instead Advent Health Orlando made it worse for our family and I got to see My Dad's Health get worse and Deteriorate. Do not go to their LVAD Program one of the worse programs I have seen in my life for My Dad had good health in him and could of made it 2 Years but that was stolen from him because first off the Hosptial never told My Dad of his serious health conditon for My Dad Contracted The Most Serious Fatal Fungus Candida right after LVAD Surgery. No One was Concerned about it and gave My Dad a Clean Bill of Health like he never experienced a Fatal Candida Fungus. No Doctors at The Ginsburg Tower ever told My Dad and his Family that he has Sepsis the first time after LVAD Surgery. If you contract Sepsis you can get it worse the next time. No Doctor who came in to look at My Dad at The Ginsburg Tower ever told My Dad that this kind of Fungus Candida could come back and get worse and get Sepsis again if not looked at after Recovery. No Doctor looking at My Dad said it can go into your heart and lungs and brain and Kidneys as well.  No Doctor who came to look at My Dad said what kind of a fungus it was and how Fatal this Candida Fungus was and that My Dad after Rehab should have seen a Specialist to look at him to see if The Fungus came back. This is very Illegal what Advent Health Orlando did was withholding Medical History from My Dad and his family we could of gotten him the help that he needed but No Doctor ever came in the room and said Bob we just want to let you know you had a Serious Fungus called Candida after your LVAD Surgery which could come back even after IV Antifungual Treatments and it also this kind of Candida could Spread through your Lungs and Heart and Brian and Kidneys too if you do not see a Specialist. We are Looking out for you and want to make sure Bob you get the Best Quality of Care. We were Lied too and Mislead Thinking that The IV Antifungal Treatments were enough and My Dad was not set up with a Specialist from any Doctor that came into his room from Ginsburg Tower to look at him. My Dad always said he had serious shortness of breath even after The LVAD Surgery that it really did not make a difference in his left ventricle and help him breath better. Ginsburg Tower Discharged My Dad giving him a Clean Bill of health and discharged him and to this day I have No Idea if My Dad had Sepsis in him for it came back So Quickly and he fell and was weak from The Sepsis for it weakens your immune system and you can get another fatal candida fungus

When My Dad went to his visits with Dr. Pujan Patel the Worse cardiologist and Dr. Naveen Bellam and with Ashley Dupont RN they are all very liable in what happened to My Dad for they did not help him get  the quick treatment he need to live and get over Sepsis and Candida that he had in the Hosptial after LVAD Surgery. First off No of The LVAD Team or LVAD Corinator Ashley Dupont RN never told My Dad that he had a Serious Fatal Fungus that could cause Sepsis and since My Dad was having trouble breathing at the time he should of gotten a Echocardiogram but he was denied this by his LVAD Team which would of picked up Candida Fungus and it would of not become a Blood Stream Infection if they would of done this Echocaridogram but The LVAD Team told him No Echocardigram until 6-7 Months and that was too late he was already admitted with this Sepsis Fungal Pneumonia Infection",Edited 6 months ago,2025-05-01,1,en,AdventHealth_Orlando,AdventHealth_Orlando.csv,2025-05-01,4087,-0.00732490723562152,0.4821357709750567,Neutral,-0.9915,0.133,0.787,0.08,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

1663,review_17068,David Arthur,1,"Take a look at at this bill I received for a three hour emergency room visit after a bad case of food poisoning.  How in the world can a hospital justify almost $25k for a three hour visit? I get that I had a CTScan but to charge $15k for that, $6k for three hours in a room, etc? A single Azithromycin pill for $33? What a complete joke.

Did I mention that they insisted on doing the CTScan because I was out of the country about a month before and they thought maybe I could have been infected by something there.  Interesting… despite me telling them that both my dog and I got sick right after eating a specific chicken, they still insisted.  It makes sense since they can bill those ridiculous amounts.

Wait, I didn’t mention that a cash visit for the same thing would have been under $5k, according to them.

I think about all the people that don’t have the money to pay, don’t have the same insurance, have far worse situations, etc.  #AdventHealth, #adventhealthorlando  should be totally ashamed of how they are robbing people.  #BrokenSystem, #AbuseOfPower, #customerlast, #takewhatyoucan",6 months ago,2025-05-01,1,en,AdventHealth_Orlando,AdventHealth_Orlando.csv,2025-05-01,1100,-0.1794871794871795,0.5652930402930403,Negative,-0.9788,0.136,0.851,0.013,Negative,Negative (1-2★),True,True

I said the same expression that was said to 2 previous nurses in the same day. Then I get a young male nurse, said the same expression which only points out the pain I've endured. I was put on a suicide watch and. I've never in my life have in any way ever have been suicidal. I am demanding that his misinterpretation of my expression and the suicide watch to be taken off my record. We can do this amicably or legally. It is up to you...!
The man who committed assault and battery on a man who has been disabled for 8 years who is in the hospital with a spinal infection 6 weeks after a 10th hip surgery. That is 15 years minimum in prison. I never got his name yet will never forget his face. He does not possess the temperament to work in a hospital. His life is in my hands.

The ED admitted me after reviewing the care plan for my condition, we were all on the same page, be admitted, get pain management and wait for further poc from specialist. After 24 hours of my admission no specialists came to see me, nurses, attending physician, everyone knew we were waiting for the specialist. Attending even notated, saw patient, waiting for specialist.. after eagerly encouraging my nurse team to reach out to the specialist the specialist informed them that they signed off on me in the ED and that they weren’t coming for a consult. So now we are furious bc why are we here? So I demanded to be discharged, it takes nearly another 24 hours before I am seen by attending and we agree that bc of this mess I should go. Well Insurance denied all inpatient stay, providers and inpatient notes have been altered. This is a mess! I will not be on the hook for two nights at the hospital when everyone knew there was a mistake on their end! I’m beyond furious and still dealing with my severe condition.

1752,review_18237,Jorge Del Sol,5,"Good day,

If you are reading this review, you are deciding if Advent Health will care properly for you, a family member, or a friend.  My words help as you ponder your decision.

I was admitted to Advent Health Orlando, 601 E Rollins St, on April 2nd, 2025, to have a Spinal laminectomy and fusion procedure.  L3, L4, L5, and S1, a three-layer.  Dr. Baker and his team performed my surgery as planned.  From my arrival, preparation for surgery, during and after surgery were excellent.  This surgery is my seventh major surgery, which includes a total knee and shoulder replacement.  With this surgery, I had the best after-surgery experience.  I was elated with the nurses' concern for managing my pain with top-level care.  The room tech also checked on me to make sure things were in order.  I had follow-ups with the lead nurses.

Yesterday, Saturday, April 5th, was my last day at Advent Health.  Rhea was assigned to care for me.  When Rhea entered my room and spoke to me, I knew I would be in great hands.  Rhea was exceptional.  Her demeanor, willingness to care for a patient, and organizational skills are exemplary.  I never felt my pain more significant than a three while cared for by Rhea.  When Rhea arrived, my wife was also in the room and concurred with my sentiments.   After a few minutes, Michelle visited me.  WOW!  After meeting Michelle, I understood why the nursing team was so strong.  They are God sent.

Nothing is perfect.  I try hard to contain my emotions.  Unfortunately, my pain intensified to a level that my emotions overtook my logic, and for that, I am sorry.

I want to give much kudos to the following nurses, the nurse supervisor, and the nurse manager:

Shae, Alissa, Yaoska, Ivette, and Rhae - THANK YOU!

Reena - Lead Nurse - She tried her utmost best.  I felt that if she could physically have a way to remove my pain and discomfort, she would have.  Unfortunately, I just had to wait for the pain medication to kick in.  THANK YOU, Rheena!

Michelle, you are EXCEPTIONAL.  Your strength in the nurse team is demonstrated by how you carry yourself, work with the nurses, and care for patients.  I saw it firsthand.  THANK YOU!!!!

I have only positive things to say about my stay at Advent Health of Orlando, and I will highly recommend it to my family and friends.

If you can't treat patients with compassion, this isn't the career path for you.

They couldn't tell me why, so how am I not supposed to feel like this was plainly to discriminate against me? I wasn't given food until the second full day I was there. I asked for tylenol six times before I actually got it. I wasn't allowed to get phone numbers out of my phone to talk to my family and friends. I wasn't given my medication at first and it made my anxiety go through the roof. I never miss my meds. I didn't even get to talk to the psychiatrist until the day I was discharged.

Hope one of the doctors will not be as concerned to do surgery ""on a 75 year old woman"" soon after another surgery. I've had 16 surgeries without ever having a problem. I hate having to wait so long for a subsequent surgery....it just keeps me inactive for so much longer and it affects my other body parts.

However, she eventually  was moved to a private room for recovery with the hammering and drilling and very loud banging going on for several days. My mother experienced some delusional episodes after ICU and the staff called to wake me up 4am in the morning just to calm her down. As we all know a call like that usually means life or death. I strongly feel they could have control that situation differently instead of the family thinking the worse has happen. Some of the medical staff that come and go each day and night were very kind.

1891,review_86470,Carlos Ortiz,1,"My experience involved attempting to schedule an appointment with a neurologist. I prefer not to mention the doctor's name, as the issue is not with the doctor but rather with the appointment restrictions imposed by the Epilepsy Center, if we can call it that.
After multiple attempts to secure an initial appointment—due to AdventHealth repeatedly losing faxed documents—we eventually went in person to hand-deliver the paperwork. A week later, after numerous follow-ups and voicemails, we finally received a call to schedule the appointment. However, the AdventHealth representative informed us that if we visited their Epilepsy Center to see Dr. X, he would only address my daughter’s epilepsy and not her sleep issues or the anxiety caused by her seizures.
When I questioned this restriction, pointing out that all these issues were interconnected, the representative insisted that the appointment would be strictly for epilepsy treatment. Given this limitation, I had no choice but to decline the appointment, as our primary concern is treating my daughter’s overall condition, including the sleep disorder caused by it. I also reminded the representative that Dr. X specializes in sleep disorders, yet she reiterated that he would not address them.
I find it frustrating and disappointing that AdventHealth places such restrictions on doctors, preventing them from providing comprehensive care to their patients. When a condition like epilepsy affects an entire family’s well-being, it is disheartening to encounter barriers that limit access to holistic treatment options.",7 months ago,2025-04-01,1,en,AdventHealth_Orlando,AdventHealth_Orlando.csv,2025-04-01,1579,-0.028124999999999997,0.4078125,Neutral,-0.9584,0.126,0.825,0.049,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

I actually had to go back to the er for similar symptoms a few days later and found out that waterman in Tavares is now also advent health so I went there being it was closer to me. Same experience. My only complaint with waterman was one person attending the er waiting room who ran an EKG on me hit the foot which was what I was I was being admitted for and hurt tremendously and then acting like I was over reacting and slightly shaming me. She didn’t know I was there for that and I do not fault her but my only complaint would be better communication when you walk In the door. My entire rest of the visit was very nice and I very much enjoyed the way the doctors spoke to me in ways I was able to understand not being from a medical background and always asked what else they could answer or if I had questions.

1919,review_79869,larry opoliner,1,"Our recent experience with the Advent Hospital system was extremely frustrating due to poor communication, unnecessary delays, and a general lack of urgency from the staff.
I am a retired general surgeon.  My mother is 98 and fell and broke her wrist.  She was seen at an Advent urgent care and we were told she needed to be admitted to the hospital to be seen by an orthopedic surgeon, where she would be evaluated for surgery.  I asked for her to be sent to the Rollins campus but was told no, she had to go to the Altamonte facility, where she was admitted later that evening but not seen by anyone until an occupational and physical therapist “evaluated” her the next day.  Apparently, the orthopedic team was not interested in seeing a 98 year old woman themselves.
Following OT and PT evaluation we waited to speak to someone from the orthopedic team.  We were told by the nurse that he had been texting them and someone would see her soon.   That nurse would not call them directly.  After multiple requests, that nurse finally called a supervisor who, late in the afternoon, was able to put me on the phone with an orthopedic PA.   Once I was able to speak explain that my mother was living independently and had not major medical problems, he agreed that she might benefit from surgery.  Unfortunately, they only do that surgery at the Rollins campus so she would have to be transferred there for further evaluation.
After finally being transferred to Rollins for surgery, we experienced more delays. The hospitalist, who had to ”clear” her for surgery informed us that he was  at the Altamonte facility and it would be awhile before he could see her.  He did, however, without even evaluating her himself, insist that she needed to be seen by a cardiologist.  He proudly told us that he had put the consult in but also informed us that they had 24 hours to respond to this electronic request.  All this time she was kept in bed, without food or water (based on decades old medical guidelines), waiting for decisions that should have been made much sooner.

I asked the nurses if I could talk with an anesthesia provider or the orthopedic team, someone who could actually make a decision.   They said they would send a message.  When we asked if we could talk to someone who would actually call these people, we were visited by the charge nurse who said that she was not paid enough to call the doctor’s directly.  We never heard from the orthopedic team but the anesthesiologist said they could not see the patient until she was cleared by the hospitalist.
Cardiology nurse practitioner finally came by, asked the same basic questions that anyone with one day of surgical/anesthesia experience would ask and said that she was OK for surgery.  15 minutes later, the cardiologist came by and said the same thing.  The hospitalist came in around the same time, stood at the entrance to the room, never examining my mother and only entering the room when we told him my mother was hard of hearing.  It was only in the operating room when my mother was actually evaluated by the orthopedic surgeon.
The only bright spot in this experience was the surgical and anesthesia teams, who were excellent once she finally reached the OR. Unfortunately, everything leading up to that point was an exercise in frustration.
Main Issues We Experienced:
•	Poor communication among staff – Messages were ""sent"" instead of direct calls, leading to long delays.
•	Unacceptable delays in specialist evaluation – It took nearly two days for my mother to be seen by the right people.
•	Lack of urgency from the hospitalist – Decisions were made without evaluating the patient in person.
•	Unprofessional behavior from some staff members – Particularly the charge nurse, who refused to escalate concerns.
I would not recommend this hospital for anyone needing timely or well-coordinated care. The system seems broken, and the culture among some staff members does not prioritize the well-being of patients.",7 months ago,2025-04-01,1,en,AdventHealth_Orlando,AdventHealth_Orlando.csv,2025-04-01,3991,0.05866874527588813,0.4876228269085411,Neutral,-0.834,0.064,0.882,0.054,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

1980,review_8569,Jasmine McGill,1,"I had a terrible experience at this hospital. During my entire ER visit, I spoke with the doctor once. He did not bother to physically examine me, which is unacceptable to me. I got an x-ray done and a CT scan. After these scans were completed I didn't get to speak with the doctor and was told by the nurse everything was normal and I was ready to be discharged. While the nurse was explaining this to me, I mentioned that I had seen on my patient portal on my phone that I had a cyst that was discovered on my CT scan, which nobody bothered to tell me about. If I had not asked ""what about the cyst?"" nobody would have mentioned it to me at all! I've had this before years ago so it didn't worry me but I would have appreciated some type of transparency of my results. The bloodwork came back, with a bunch of levels abnormal and I had to ask the nurse my questions, which she answered ""yeah everything's normal, things can sometimes be off but that doesn't mean anything."" I honestly think this hospital is headed on its way for a huge incident in regards to liability and malpractice. They were extremely busy, I could tell, but the type of service I received here was unacceptable. I was reading my after care summary online just now and it says ""The plan has been discussed with the Patient. All questions have been answered at this time and they are agreeable with the plan of care for discharge."" NO QUESTIONS WERE ANSWERED. Its insane to me that they are writing things on official documents as if it happened, when it in fact did not. No plan of care was discussed and I didn't even see the doctor before getting discharged or after the results of any of my scans came out. If I did not have access to my patient portal where I can personally view the results of my tests, I would be unaware of my ongoing health. Shame on you guys that is absolutely unacceptable. I can't imagine the amount of patients who currently have conditions that should have been caught by ER doctor's here if they actually took the time to assess each patient's health as they should. So many patients most likely go home with conditions they have no idea about it because the doctors don't bother to mention it.

I waited 4 months for much needed colon surgery at Akron General which my primary care doctor said caused me to get a life threatening blood clot. I was told they had a shortage of doctors and I would just have to wait. In my opinion, the CEO is more concerned with profits and purchasing more and more hospitals and private physician practices. As a result, the quality of care is suffering. Supposedly, it’s a nonprofit organization, yet the CEO is paid over $4 million annually. Again, my opinion, but Cleveland Clinic is now just all about the $$$. There was a time when it was a patient first organization.

28,review_27496,Kc Myers,3,The cardiologist is wonderful! He takes the time needed to evaluate you as an individual patient. The billing here is a damn mess and you are doubled billed for everything. One bill from the doctor and one bill for use of the facility. This makes no sense. Even after your copays your account sits dormant for weeks then the billing department calls to get authorization to apply those funds to something else after the fact. It takes about 2 months to get all of your final bills before you know what you really owe or are even paying for. Pay attention to your billing too because doctors you never saw or were treated by are adding bills and you have to call to have it removed.

69,review_79860,Jessica Archer,1,"As a long-time resident of Cleveland, I find it disheartening to witness how Cleveland Clinic has increasingly shifted its focus away from accessible care toward luxury services for the privileged few. While VIP suites and Premier Care packages are heavily advertised, regular patients and working-class families are often left waiting in overcrowded lobbies, facing long delays and limited resources.

This hospital was once seen as a cornerstone of community health, yet now it seems more interested in catering to high-income patients than serving the people who actually live here. The imbalance is glaring: fancy executive wings sit nearly empty while understaffed emergency departments struggle to meet basic needs.

86,review_61369,Karli Bossman,1,"I would not recommend Dr. Jaime Ann Vondenberg. My experience with her at Cleveland Clinic was deeply disappointing and felt like a complete waste of time, energy, and money.

I drove all the way from North Carolina to Ohio to see her in November, hoping to finally get clarity and support for my ongoing health concerns. At the initial appointment, I shared that I had been treated for years as a child for autoimmune encephalitis, that I’ve had a positive ANA multiple times, and that I was experiencing symptoms like chronic fatigue and a red rash across my cheeks. I told her I suspected lupus, and she ran tests—eventually ruling it out. That was fine, but what followed was incredibly frustrating.

We scheduled a Zoom follow-up for February so I wouldn’t have to drive back, and during that appointment, she told me she didn’t believe I had any autoimmune issue at all—despite my medical history and repeated positive ANA tests. She also told me I should see an immunologist, even though she is double board-certified in both rheumatology and immunology herself.

When I asked about the facial rash—after a dermatologist specifically said it was not rosacea and told me to talk to my rheumatologist—Dr. Vondenberg brushed it off and said we should just try a cream because she thought it looked like rosacea. This felt dismissive and unscientific.

Later, I contacted her again after another doctor found elevated thyroid antibodies and wanted more testing done. I reminded her again of my history with encephalitis, and she told me to schedule another appointment. I did—even though it was over a month out—and when I finally saw her again, she was late and completely dismissed everything I had to say. She refused to run any more tests, and repeated the same opinions from our earlier conversations as if nothing new had been presented.

I don’t understand why she had me book and pay for another appointment if she had no interest in revisiting the situation or digging deeper—even when new labs were available and there was a clear history of autoimmune disease.

If you’re looking for a rheumatologist/immunologist who will actually listen, consider your full medical history, and take your concerns seriously, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere.

You can be in an urgent (not life threatening) situation and the apathy of scheduling an appointment to address the urgent matter is ridiculous. Over 2 weeks ago I called with an urgent situation, followed up with three different phone calls, and when I finally reached the office directly, I was told ""I'll pass it along to the team to see what they want to do."" Apparently, they wanted to do nothing since it's been a week and absolutely nothing has been done - no follow-up, no scheduling, nothing. I've had enough of this money mill. While Cleveland Clinic may have the best technology money can buy, if there's no concern or quality patient care and all you're treated as is a number, all the equipment in the world is worthless.

Fast forward to now…. I brought my fiancé to the Clinic for her ascending aortic aneurysm and high blood pressure after several different doctors and specialists, again in Evansville, IN with no success! Are you seeing the issues here?

The doctors in Evansville have no clue how to treat their patients! The doctor she saw at the Cleveland Clinic knew exactly what her issues were and was able to readjust her BP meds, (she was on FIVE different medications with no success) and got her down to only three medications just once a day instead of FIVE medications three times per day!

The doctors, nurses, and other staff were absolutely AMAZING!!! Belinda McKinney in the registration office was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! She was SO CARING and so polite and friendly! She actually CARED about the patient! The staff at Deaconess Hospital in Evansville, IN DOES NOT CARE about the patients AT ALL!!!

The specialist doctor that treated my fiancé was so polite, knowledgeable, helpful, and professional! He actually CARED about her and wondered why she was on so many different medications for her blood pressure! He made her feel better about her aneurysm overall and putting her on less medications as well.

We are looking forward to working with the Cleveland Clinic and their team in the future. We’re DEFINITELY not going to let any more of the doctors OR hospitals, especially Deaconess Hospital in Evansville treat us again! They are absolutely HORRIBLE!!!

173,review_56416,Chris Myers,1,"Hello-We consulted with the Cleveland Clinic regarding my Wife's chronic Lyme infection after searching for help locally in WV. After two rounds of doxycycline, we started thinking that we needed to look outside of the area. She received her first Lyme diagnoses from a rheumatologist along with a couple others on this visit including ankylosing spondylitis. She tested positive for Lyme and was prescribed two weeks of doxycycline. She continued to decline, saw many physicians, and was ultimately misdiagnosed with MS as well as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. This same neurologist who diagnosed her with MS later agreed that she did indeed have Lyme, and it had triggered her ""MS"" after a spinal tap, serology testing and MRI's that revealed Lyme and the Epstein Barr virus. We then decided to consult with the big guns in Ohio since now she had two diagnoses of Lyme and had tried two weeks of doxycycline but was still in rapid decline. We were being told if she was still having symptoms after two weeks of antibiotics, then it couldn't be Lyme. Growing desperate we called and spoke with a very nice lady at the Cleveland Clinic and were surprised to find out they would ""treat"" my Wife. I cannot tell you how excited we were to finally get some help with this terribly common, but seemingly invisible disease. We made the appointment with the infectious disease doctor Chris Kovacs Jr., drove to Cleveland, booked a room and tried to sleep anticipating that everything was finally going to ""be OK"". The next morning, we arrived for the appointment at 7:45 and were impressed with the Clinic's ""Operation"" until we got in front of their doctor Chris Kovacs Jr. who broke our hearts and wasted our time and money. After listening to her case for approximately five-six minutes, he informed us that ""We don't have Lyme in WV and if she hadn't traveled to the northeast of the US then she hadn't been exposed to Lyme"" as to which I replied, ""I don't mean to be rude but, where do our dogs get it?"" he then said that my Wife ""definitely did NOT have Lyme"" and suggested that maybe she needed more attention at home after asking my profession, which is sales. Chris Kovacs Jr. then refused any testing for Lyme or co-infections and we left his office in tears wondering what just happened. We traveled back to WV and by luck ran into someone whose Mother had Lyme but was misdiagnosed with ALS. She was treated by a local doctor and her ""ALS"" went into remission. I couldn't believe what I was hearing and we got in touch with that physician who is now semi-retired and after proper testing, she finally got a more appropriate treatment for Lyme. This brave doctor reported the positive serology results to the Kanawha County Health Department. Now she is ""on file"" as having positive Lyme serology results and we have received Lyme Brochures from the Health Department published by the CDC, Lyme book markers, and vinyl yard signs that read with the warning ""Lyme lives here”. These were nice quality signs btw, if you are reading, please send more. I tacked ours up around the neighborhood. Apparently they track this sort of thing IF your doctor reports it through the proper non-insurance channels. She ended up getting treated with antibiotics including a PICC line with ceftriaxone. We are both very much still affected by Lyme today and if only our family physician had given my Wife $40-$50 dollars worth of antibiotics when she first presented, then maybe, just maybe I wouldn't be typing this at work right now. Any physician who denies Lyme can be a chronic infection should be ashamed of themselves for their lack of courage to help. They know the truth and Lyme needs to be given the credence that people deserve. It's a sad day when the insurance ""front"" tells you that ""You don't have Lyme in WV"". I'm surprised he didn't call it ""Lymes"". I would clearly give ""0"" stars if that was possible.

174,review_86738,Nkumu Mandungu,1,"Don’t believe the hype! Very good ancillary services/support staff, less than effective and relatively average to low skilled physicians with way below average investigative skills and diagnosis acumen! For an institution that is supposed to be amongst the best in the country, and best in cardiac care for several years in a row, I was sorely disappointed. Either they are buying their rankings or the ranking publications are simply skipping over the EP section… Once you get past the bells and whistles, e.g. massive state of the heart facility, concierge like service for foreign patients, etc… you quickly realize that this hospital system is mostly like any other, except it does an incredible job at marketing both its past and current exceptional achievements. These achievements  are carried out by a very limited few. In other words exceptional/thorough docs are in short supply in this hospital, like in any other. They just do a great job of marketing and advertising the accomplishments of a very select few physicians, who are the exception and not the norm. Note, you will likely not have access to these exceptional physicians as they are in high demand. Instead You will be farmed out to much less proficient physicians who are no different than your average local specialist… I dealt with the cardiology department, specifically its electrophysiology section… The staff/ancillary medical team were awesome; however the Electrophysiologist I dealt with, was poorly organized, not thorough and contrary to what their cardiac appointment staff advertised, did not deal with highly complex arrhythmia diagnosis and curative treatment… His approach did not entail any in depth investigative processes, e.g. review of prior incident QRS morphology, review of clues provided by prior and current imagery, etc… He did exactly what the avg to below avg EPs I’ve seen so far, have all done: (1) Focused on the primary symptoms that suited his skill set and (2) ignored any acute symptoms that fell beyond his expertise, while heavily relying on the medications vs. investigating the root cause(s)… (3) failed to enlist the help of more experienced colleagues. He did not address the root causes of the disease regardless of its progression and instead preferred to settle on highly curated symptoms’ treatment, while hoping that acuity or worsening would not be immediate… This of course nearly ensures that down the line, once the disease process has worsened, I will be back for more acute and expansive services… What a revenue model… I strongly recommend that (A) you do extensive research and identify which physician(s) has the skillset that is required, to not just “treat” you but to actually cure you/find and tackle root cause(s) of your ailment before going to this hospital. And (B) ensure that this physician can actually see you/is available. (C) most important: Ensure that they are thorough, which is largely the exception. WHY? It takes time and work, for which they may not get a financial return. Otherwise, you are wasting your time and money. Just stick to your local specialist. Do not let the appointment staff randomly select a physician/specialist for you, based on availability. The physicians who have high availability generally tend to be the least effective/least thorough ones; hence their open schedules… Oh and their patient complaint process does not entail a conclusive resolution mechanism, as the clinical teams are not obliged to take corrective measures or communicate those measures to the patient… which leaves you wondering why come back to this hospital… Bottom line: Don’t believe the hype. Do your homework. If you are not getting satisfactory answers, e.g. booking agents tell you that “all EPs treat complex arrhythmias” and the one they suggest is really good, don’t believe them… Insist on the one whose name you found through research or who was recommended by another patient with ailments similar to yours and who’s received treatment here recently. If this is not a possibility, go somewhere else/don’t waste your time and money.",Edited 7 months ago,2025-04-01,1,en,Cleveland_Clinic,Cleveland_Clinic.csv,2025-04-01,4090,0.10885589978963468,0.42301587301587285,Positive,0.9622,0.041,0.887,0.073,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

That I thought included quality care with good communication. I paid a premium price for trash services. Please do not waste your time, money or energy with this business. That is what it really is. Not a medical facility that actually cares about their patients.

I drove 4 hours for a procedure the doctor begged me to come back for because this is ""the best"", instead of getting this done locally. For the procedure, I was forgotten about twice, delaying this procedure over 2 hours and they even reset my locker code so I could not get my cloths to change and leave. The worker literally said, ""Oh your still here? I thought you were long gone and reset the lockers"". Once I got my cloths on, I came out to find my boyfriend in a dark waiting room; tv's were turned off (he had not idea where I was), all staff was gone and the janitor was cleaning the space. They closed that area down with not only a patient in the back, but a guest waiting with NO communication what's so ever. I did fill out their survey, hoping they'd reach back considering the situation. I have yet to get a response back from Cleveland about how they ""forget about"" patients.
I wish my experience ended there...it doesn't. Shortly after my first apt, I started a new medicine regiment this doctor prescribed. A couple days into this,  I received a very scary phone call from my pharmacy. He proceed to ask me how I was doing and specifically my heart/vascular system regarding the meds I was prescribed. Which was concerning as I am being seen for vascular issues causing GI issues post chemo treatment. I was given an anti-depressant that was suppose to ""help my stomach muscles to stop over working"" that has MAJOR side effects for vascular issues, including heart attacks. Which I was on the brink of going to the ER for chest pain. I have never had that kind of pain before. I also was informed that the ""high cholesterol"" meds he gave for helping bind food in my stomach do not play well together with the anti-depressant, causing further discomfort and issues to my GI system. The pharmacist was EXTREMELY confused and concerned what drugs I was prescribed and why I was given them. There are plenty of other options that could have been discussed prior to that combo (per pharmacists words). He then advised that I stop both meds right away and consultant a different medical professional.

Then to add more injury to insult, an MRA was ordered that ended up sharing exact opposite of what the doctor told me it would provide. Surprise surprise, it showed vascular problems, causing GI issues. The doctor then thought it was appropriate to send me a one line message on mychart. Completely ignoring these results went against what he previously said. I asked for a 5 minute phone chat right away as I can not get back into him in person till end of March to discuss meds and the results. I messaged Wednesday 2/26 morning and its now Monday 3/3 in the afternoon. No point of contact has been made besides some nurse Friday right before closing saying my message was received and the doctor would get back to me. I guess I am finally in line for a point of contact? There was no time frame or idea when any point of contact would be made. Wednesday 3/5 will be a week from my initial message. This doesn't even include any follow up on said meds are doing from initial apt over 2 weeks ago. Which is VERY concerning, considering what I learned from my pharmacist.

203,review_1381,Tonya Miller,1,I would not recommend Dr. Truong to anyone nor would I recommend Cleveland Clinic.  Her delay in care caused direct harm to a patient. My parents put their trust and my father’s life in her hands and with her negligent care she caused harm. My father has metastatic melanoma and had been referred to the Cleveland Clinic to Dr Truong in November 2024. He was supposed to start treatment in which the office failed to schedule. So we started to call the office and ask what the hold up was. By the time Dr Truong set up a telehealth appointment with my father it was in January. Keep in mind from November to January he had no treatment at all in which this allowed the cancer to spread.  Fast forward 2 weeks and still nothing had been ordered. My father was in a lot of pain so my mom took him to U of M ER in which they did CT scans and the cancer had spread significantly throughout his body since November. And I 100% blame Dr Truong for this. Her delay in care caused direct patient harm.  I do not recommend Dr Truong to anyone as she took an oath to care for her patients and failed miserably to do so. Now he will be getting his treatment at U of M and Columbus Ohio and all we can do is pray that her negligence doesn’t cost my father his life.,9 months ago,2025-01-31,1,en,Cleveland_Clinic,Cleveland_Clinic.csv,2025-01-31,1253,-0.17500000000000002,0.5535714285714285,Negative,-0.9807,0.167,0.769,0.064,Negative,Negative (1-2★),True,True

There is no pull out couch for parent(s) to sleep on. What is given was a small, torn up couch with zero space to accommodate one individual let alone two parents for an overnight stay.

I went here when I was younger and switched elsewhere because of how rude the doctors were and because they made us get bloodwork at the appointment instead of getting it beforehand to then discuss at the appointment. I came back for a second opinion this year and saw Dr Karen Murray. I brought up a rare condition I wanted to be tested for because doctors just could not figure out what was wrong with me. My mom had printed over 1,000 pages of my medical records and she didn't even glance at them and she didn't do an exam. She laughed at me and said I do not have said condition. She recommended a follow up with psychiatry. A few months later and I have a feeding tube due to her negligence.

248,review_57764,Dylan Holderness,1,"Many believe that Cleveland Clinic is one of the best medical centers in the world. I couldn't disagree more.. after receiving so much medical care in different states, CC is by far the worst. I moved back to Cleveland About nine months ago after receiving a lot of specialty care in Pennsylvania from (UPMC) and Colorado (Denver Health) both of which i was incredibly happy with and the many doctors that I saw over that time period. I worried about finding new doctors that I liked as much but tried to keep hope that I'd find ones I was just as happy with. Boy was I wrong. I've been to several doctors at Cleveland Clinic for most specialties, and each of them are worse than the last. They don't seem to care at all about their patients, only about prescribing the newest and most expensive non-generic medications for each condition. I had been on most of my medications for years because they actually worked, as well as insurance fully covering them. Now they only care about prescribing what's newest, most expensive, or that they make money off of. Even if it doesn't work or falls out of your price range they continue trying to convince you to take it. None of the work me, or my previous doctors did matters to them. Any meds you were previously on don't matter and will be stopped. I'd look anywhere else before giving Cleveland Clinic your time and your health.
I'm now constantly suffering after being taken off half of my meds. For example with my migraines. They don't even want you taking over-the-counter medications. Probably because they don't make the money from the drug company. I'd do anything to return to my old doctors and the state I was in with my previous treatments. Look elsewhere if you have any choice in the matter.
Its also very difficult to get an appointment for months or even a year+ and if you need help or refills on meds before you can get an appointment you're out of luck. I've pretty much given up on my medical care because of all this.
I hope this advice helps someone. Wish I would have known before trusting my health conditions with them.

And it actually happened twice, inhaled the same thing months later for it to mess me up again. and we did a small test of me exhaling hard into a small machine and the person conducting the test said I was doing great, then Rabeea comes back into the room saying the test was done incorrectly and we got nothing. So theres miscommunication there

I communicated to them I'd be leaving the state in a month. I know that's asking a time restriction on them for their already busy schedule but that doesn't justify ghosting me. She said i'll do 2 tests then well have a followup visit. I did those 2 tests and never heard back. Even 2 hours after the first visit I call and email her assistant Saenz and got a message saying she wont be in office for like a week.

No followup visit was ever scheduled. And im still here coughing. I had one shot at getting treatment and having it taken care of by workers comp before I had to move, and I wasted it on these people. Now i have to start from scratch out of pocket in a new state

On 8/8 an appointment for an ultrasound & mid- wife I arrived at 10/10:15 am for a 12:30 scheduled appointment, an oversight on my end. However with less than 10 people in the practice, they ENSURED to have me wait till my scheduled time while people were sitting and standing around conversing about non work related topics. On this day I didn’t finish everything till after 3pm, causing me to miss an appointment I had scheduled for 2:30 elsewhere, all I received was apologies
Today on 8/24, the final straw, I arrived at 8:46 when I had an 8:30am scheduled appointment and was instructed to use the kiosk which didn’t work for SEVERAL people who stepped off the line. One lady stepped off and jumped back in front of me, causing me to now check in later & be late for my appointment. The ultra sound techs then decided to call individuals who check in after me and have me wait almost TWO HOURS just for my name to be called for an hour ultrasound.……… I do not feel advocated for at this facility, they are scheduling more individuals than they can handle and they are excessively short staffed!!!!
Oh, and let me add, while I was late for the 8:30am appointment I have an 11am same day with the mid wife again and it’s currently 11:30am and I’ve not been called yet!

69,review_35718,Baron Z,1,"I’ve lived in the U.S. for 23 years — 20 of them in New York — and I never thought I’d come back here and feel this unwelcome in the city I once called home. I currently live in Colorado, and I came back to New York on vacation with my daughter to visit my mother. On the night of June 24, 2025, I started having discomfort and tightness on the left side of my chest, so I went to this hospital hoping for care and safety. Instead, I felt invisible.

No one really acknowledged me. I was left sitting there in pain, feeling worse by the minute. I get that ERs are busy — I truly do — but the lack of basic human decency was shocking. I kept waiting and waiting, barely getting checked. And when they finally discharged me, I was still feeling awful.

Before leaving, I asked my nurse — a woman covered in tattoos — if I could please stay just 30 more minutes to feel stable before stepping out. I wasn’t drunk or high, I was just feeling physically unwell. But instead of any empathy, she coldly told me I could only stay for 15 minutes, and if I didn’t leave, she’d call security. Really? That’s how you treat someone who’s asking for help?

When I stood up to leave, she gave me the fakest “Feel better” I’ve ever heard. It was like mockery. I looked at her and thought — one day, you’ll get sick too. One day, you’ll be scared and vulnerable. And maybe someone will treat you the way you just treated me.

I don’t like to say this, but as an Asian man, I couldn’t help but wonder — would I have been treated differently if I looked or spoke differently? Was it bias? Was it just cruelty? I don’t know. But the whole experience left me feeling humiliated and heartbroken. I came seeking care, and I left feeling worse than when I walked in.

99,review_19654,don,1,A pathetic place.. please do not go there.. I am here in New York for just 4 nights and unexpectedly my 10 year old daughter started vomiting yesterday. Since I am on travel I thought of getting some medication to settle her. It was nothing but vomiting without any other symptoms and since I knew nothing about New York on the way to St. John’s Cathedral I asked my taxi driver to take me to a place to see a doctor. My goodness I ended up in this place and they took her in and put a canula right away saying she has symptoms of appendicitis and has high BP. They did blood test and took a urine sample and was about to do an ultrasound scan. I got the smell of the thing right away and I know what’s about to happen. I somehow stopped them doing the ultrasound and even having the urine sample in hand they decided to discharge my daughter after I explained them that I’m here for something for nausea that might be obvious after 15 hours of flight two days before or worst case scenario a mild viral infection. So they came up with a bill of 1350 USD. Fortunately I had money to settle that and came running away. They prescribed her a single medication initially I thought something for nausea or stomach issues but at the pharmacy I found it’s just paracetamol. It ruined my entire day and the travel too. I know I did a terrible mistake to go there without any search. They started giving her saline and stopped that right away and discharged. When I asked them to at least finish the saline they told that amount they have given is enough.. pls guys beware of them.

127,review_24613,Sasha,1,"This review is about my brief Birth experience at the Main Mount Sinai Hospital at Klingstein Pavillion.  I was scheduled for inductions/ TOLAC on December 8th 2024.

The process of my inductions was pretty standard, I got IV, I hooked up to EFM machine, and sonogram to confirm baby was head down. For pregnant people who cervix are long and high and previous csection, my options are few: Cook Cathether ( mechanical dilated cervix) in combination with pitocin. I agreed to only a cook catheter before starting pitocin.

From Dec 8th 1120pm to Dec 9th approximately 411am-418am, Hospital Resident MD Cersonky removed it and informed me that my cervix was 4cm dilated/ 70% effaced/ -4 station. I was so excited because that meant I had few centimeters to go and baby will be here.

But...After third cervical exam performed by Dr. Warner MFM fellow stated "" Your external os is 4cm/ but your internal os is 2cm"" my mood immediately deflated. The nail in the coffin was when MFM Attending Dr. ONA provided the most unsafe options, 2 options specifically: Break my water even though my baby head was not engaged or re-insert cook catheter with pitocin remaining at 10. I declined both options. However, I opted to stop Pitocin and continued use of movement in labor with my doula.

After that encountered, I lost trust in the medical team. There no apologize at that time. I was pissed-- I was mislead to believe something that wasn't true. As a Labor & Delivery nurse it made see how patients who aren't aware or even had birth education courses could get taken advantage of. Seeing this all proved me, that moment, I needed to advocate myself, the same way I do for my pregnant patients.

That's what I did!

After discussion with my husband and doula, I decided to stop my induction at Mount Hospital and leave an environment where my Birth Plan wasn't considered.

I'm grateful, I went to another facility to restart my induction.",9 months ago,2025-01-31,1,en,Mount_Sinai_Hospital,Mount_Sinai_Hospital.csv,2025-01-31,1933,0.0678935185185185,0.34738425925925925,Neutral,-0.9304,0.074,0.891,0.035,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

Blood work came back & showed my kidneys were just fine. That same resident who put in my chart & kept saying that I had kidney failure told the nurse to give me a “IV bag”. When I asked her what was it she was giving me she stated “I don’t know”. I refused. The same nurse comes back in again & said “it’s for your heart”. I told her there’s nothing wrong with my heart. She then comes back in again and she says “well the doctor (the same resident) said if you take this medication he’ll let you go home”. When I refused again I told her to bring me the resident who was telling her these things.

Within Mount Sinai Hospital ER by far, I have experienced the worst service of all times, I would not classify it as ""care"" at all. The ER was absolutely understaffed with nurses who were overstacked with workload, to the point where nurses were 2-3 hours late to their commitments.

Judging by the juggling that the nurses had to do to cope with the understaffing, I would not blame them for constantly being distracted by conversations about nails or bitching about a certain someone they commonly hate. If only we saw more work out of care rather than hear random gibberish about random people from the employees' end, our time at the ER probably would have been more fruitful.

For a night-long session that costs over $500 dollars, we do expect some service other than see what's your style or lingo. We want service in exchange for money. The second you are clocked in, you gotta work.

Now I see that things I have heard about health care are basically right.

28,review_89108,Iziegbe Okungbowa,1,"I was extremely disappointed with my experience at the Methodist Hospital OBGYN in Cypress. I had been in pain and bleeding since May and came in hoping for answers. I explained all my symptoms to the doctor and even brought the MRI disk and ultrasound results from another hospital. Despite this, the doctor didn’t perform a pelvic or uterine exam—she only pressed on my stomach and lower abdomen. After briefly reviewing my MRI, she told me I needed emergency surgery and scheduled it for the earliest available date, which was two weeks later.

The day before my scheduled surgery, I received multiple calls from the billing department demanding $4,000 upfront or my procedure would be canceled. I was devastated. I had been suffering for months, and the doctor herself had stressed how urgent the surgery was. I tried to set up a payment plan and explained how unreasonable it was to call someone one day before such a major procedure demanding that kind of money. They did not care and ultimately canceled my surgery.

To make matters worse, when I asked for my MRI disk back to show my next doctor, the nurse told me it was lost and suggested I go back to the imaging center to request another one from the hospital I got it from. Mind you, they were aware I got this done in Lagos, Nigeria. This was careless and deeply frustrating. Meanwhile, my mom was flying in the next morning to support me, unaware that the surgery had already been canceled.

The whole experience was stressful, devastating, and revealed how little compassion the hospital showed. The staff came across as more concerned with money than patient care.

80,review_66105,Karina DaSilva,1,"My husband was seen in the ER at Houston Methodist on Fannin yesterday, and we left feeling completely dismissed and deeply concerned about the quality of care he received. After eight days of unexplained high fevers, we came in hoping for answers and help. Instead, we encountered a number of issues, starting with a major patient safety concern.

At one point, my husband was taken to a room because they said he was being admitted, only to later find out they had mistaken him for another patient. That is completely unacceptable and incredibly alarming.

To make matters worse, the ER doctor, Dr. Benjamin Godfrey, was rude and dismissive when I began asking questions. I was simply trying to advocate for my husband and understand what was going on. He has been sick for over a week with no explanation, and we were told everything looked “normal.” When I asked if he could be kept for observation, Dr. Godfrey cut me off mid-question and abruptly said “no,” stating we didn’t meet criteria, without offering any meaningful explanation. He was short and condescending, as if my questions were a challenge rather than a concerned wife trying to help.

I also asked if more testing could be done since we still don’t know what’s causing the fever. Even he admitted he was concerned about the unknown origin, yet said additional tests weren’t necessary. How does that make sense?

We left with no answers, no treatment plan, and a complete loss of trust in the care we received. Between being confused with another patient and being treated like our concerns didn’t matter, this visit was unacceptable.

The doctor (an older male) did not even look into his throat but instead put a flat wooden stick in his mouth to see if there was a cough. No cough. Didn’t even ask for my brother for any other side effects he was having. They dismissed him home with pain medication and nothing else. 3 months later my brother is up in Pennsylvania, throat pain still going strong and now bumps all over his body. After checking into a hospital there with little money to offer, these doctors went above and beyond to find out his body was fighting an infection he had for 3-4 months, which is now finally going away after they prescribed him the right medicine, his throat pain is almost gone now and the bumps all over his body (he had for a month) are gone. Somehow Houston Methodist looked over this infection and if it weren’t for him checking into that hospital in Pennsylvania, things could’ve turned out worse. Now I would like to know how small town doctors in Pennsylvania were able to spot an infection in the body that “the best hospital in Houston” couldn’t even find? Didn’t even put ANY efforts in checking my brother and actually finding out what was wrong with him and dismissed him with a strep throat. Even LBJ is more willing and helpful than Houston Methodist.

I work in Willobrook Methodist and when my mother was there better care she received. My mother was in Hospital on Methodist fanin almost over 2 months . I spend most of time arguing with nurses and director  on how the nurses wouldn’t not come and check on mother not come do her bad she was in icu she developed bed sores because nurses wouldn’t not rotate her every 2 hours like they was supposed too. My mother passed away and I spent most of time arguing with the staff on how to care for a patient in ICU. My mother was intubated but was able to write and tell us nurses were mean to her. It is so disappointing that we trust this doctors and nurses but yet end of day the care is horrible. I took notes names etc daily on who I spoke too etc WORST HOSPITAL!  One day they say she’s ok next day they say her liver dead honestly this was the worst experience ever losing my mother . I also think yall should train nurses on when putting patients on RESTRAINS ON HANDS  THEY SHOULD LOSEN THEM UP SO BLOOD CAN FLOW MY MOTHER DEVELOPED BLOOD CLOTHS ON HANDS BECAUSE NURSES HAD THEM SO TIGHT.

118,review_52948,C Riley,1,"To Whom It May Concern,

My name is Courtnie Riley, and I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding a recent interaction I had with a member of your Case Management team at Houston Methodist Hospital in the Medical Center.

I received a call from Gail, who identified herself as the Director of Case Management on 4/23/35. She provided information that was both inaccurate and dismissive. Despite previous conversations with other hospital staff who indicated that the medical team would explore my mother’s condition further to identify the underlying pathology behind her repeated hospitalizations, Gail abruptly informed me that we needed to come pick up my mother and handle everything on an outpatient basis. We do not believe that it is safe for her to be discharged at this point, and we are simply asking for a comprehensive evaluation before making such a serious decision.

Gail continuously interrupted me, spoke over me, and engaged in unnecessary banter when I attempted to express my concerns. As a concerned daughter advocating for my mother’s health and well-being, I found her tone and behavior to be rude, condescending, and completely lacking in empathy or professionalism.

When I asked to speak with her supervisor or even just to be given a name and contact number, she refused. She instead told me to speak to someone in guest relations, even after I made it clear that I wished to speak directly with her superior. She then hung up on me. I attempted to call back, and she still would not provide any information.

If I had to rate my experience with the Case Management department based on my interaction with Gail, it would be a 0 out of 10. Her conduct reflects poorly on the hospital and undermines the trust families place in Houston Methodist during vulnerable times. It is not just what you say—it is how you say it. And in this case, Gail’s approach was completely unacceptable.

I strongly urge hospital leadership to review this matter and hold staff accountable for the way they communicate with patients and their families. I am still requesting to speak directly with Gail’s supervisor and would appreciate a follow-up on this issue.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

127,review_17612,Jo Lou,1,"This review is for Houston Methodist’s Billing & Customer Service only. The billing for services received at this hospital can be a nightmare. They won’t let you receive care unless you pay your estimate upfront which is understandable but good luck having them fix anything.  If it’s not in their normal checklist to check it can be frustrating. My patience in trying to get a problem fixed has been going on for almost two years now.
Also, lab services received at their doctor’s office in the Med Center have a different billing department and the balances don’t show up in MyChart. I had to flip back to receiving paper bills because the billing in MyChart is confusing and surprise bills from doctors that practice there but have their own billing service.

136,review_43490,Randall Wilhite,5,"My recent surgery for a left bicep and distal tendon repair at Methodist Hospital in Houston was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment I walked through the doors until my discharge, I was treated with extraordinary care and professionalism at every turn.

The pre-surgical team was remarkably thorough in their preparation, answering all my questions with patience and clarity. My surgeon demonstrated both technical expertise and extraordinary skills, taking time to explain the procedure and expected outcomes in detail. The anesthesia team was equally impressive, ensuring my comfort while carefully monitoring my condition throughout.

Another thing that truly sets Methodist Hospital apart is the nursing staff. Their attentiveness, expertise, and warmth made a potentially stressful experience remarkably smooth. They anticipated my needs, managed the entire surgical process effectively, and treated me with dignity and respect at all times.

Even the administrative staff handled insurance matters and scheduling with efficiency, care and kindness.

The facility itself was immaculately clean, comfortable, and well-organized. Every aspect of my care appeared to be coordinated seamlessly among all departments.

Methodist Hospital has clearly cultivated a culture of excellence and compassion that permeates every level of care. My experience exceeded all expectations, and I'm profoundly grateful to every individual who contributed to my successful surgery and recovery.

151,review_88094,Kallie Swider,1,"I was not taken seriously nor given the proper medical or legal advice. No police report was filed. My blood and CT scan results were never reported to me by a physician. I saw one doctor during the three times I was admitted, and I was never discharged. Instead of addressing my concerns, they covertly tried to admit me to a mental health clinic—having me change clothes, put on a diaper (which I refused), wand me, and state clearly, “We are not admitting you into the hospital.”

I was “seen” by numerous nurses and “police officers,” yet across three ER visits, I was not helped. My condition—severe sleep deprivation—only worsened. Despite repeatedly stating that I was being trafficked, I was denied the help I needed. A department doctor even told me, “You will never get sleep medication at a Houston Methodist hospital.”

I eventually began violently hitting my head against the wall while a myriad of people watched and did absolutely nothing. A nurse detained me, throwing me into a room, though they did release me when I asked. I repeatedly voiced my issues—again and again—to people who did nothing. Then, I was simply allowed to walk out, having received no actual help, only endless dismissal and condescending attitudes. I was forced to follow up with my GP just to get the medication I needed.

The first night I left, I asked a nurse for something to help me calm down and rest in the hospital before taking any kind of psychiatric evaluation. They refused. I was then told, “You will be discharged from this hospital if you do not take a psychiatric evaluation. If you do not take this evaluation, you will have to leave.” They refused medical care for over five hours despite clear evidence and a diagnosis proving that the issues I was reporting were real.

They left my blood tubes in the room with the trash. They had me sit in a chair for most of the time—I had to ask for a room with a bed. At one point, I had to threaten to call the police just to stop them from trying to admit me into a psychiatric ward.",7 months ago,2025-04-01,1,en,Houston_Methodist_Hospital,Houston_Methodist_Hospital.csv,2025-04-01,2035,0.026504629629629628,0.4088624338624338,Neutral,-0.874,0.083,0.857,0.06,Negative,Negative (1-2★),False,True

180,review_30286,VH,2,"Methodist Hospital price gouges for procedures, and as such are part of the healthcare system crisis in America.  The fair pricing for the oncological surgery procedure I needed in August 2024 in Houston was around $13,880 (this includes surgeon, facility, and anesthesia).  Methodist was charging $70,392 (this is what they report to insurance companies) with a self-pay discount of 50% $$35,196 - which is what you pay if you pay for the procedure yourself.  Even with the 50% discount, the amount is more than double what fair price is. I gave them 2 stars because you could tell the individual employees were really trying to get a better discount so I could get the surgery and they cared, but when they went higher up the chain the main person said ""this is what the hospital charges and if she can't pay it she'll have to go somewhere else."" I went with Baylor St. Luke's which offered fair pricing. They have a brand new facility and I really loved my surgeon and staff. She is very intelligent, competent, and has a very calm demeanor (Dr. Hoppenot).

I don't have regular health insurance, I have a medical sharing plan called ""Sedera"" offered by my workplace.  They are trying to be a solution to the system, the only thing about using them is that you need to do a lot of legwork and obtain quotes from these facilities if you need something paid upfront (and they'll only reimburse fair pricing, not price gouging), or you also pay for smaller office specialist visits then they reimburse you, so I've been able to really see the underbelly of the medical system trying to get all these quotes for my surgery.",9 months ago,2025-01-31,1,en,Houston_Methodist_Hospital,Houston_Methodist_Hospital.csv,2025-01-31,1622,0.3137212121212121,0.5532587412587412,Positive,0.9833,0.029,0.849,0.121,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

Went to the Houston Methodist Hospital as recommended by telemedicine. I arrived at 2:00am, the nurse did blood work and CT scan, but the doctor never came to see me. From 6:00 to 7:00am they said that there was a shift so another doctor was signing in. After asking a few times where is the doctor they said that the shift takes time and that the Dr will come to see me eventually. The Dr. Came to see me at 10:00am (8 hours later and because I kept asking). They gave me medicine and I was able to swallow at 11:30am. But, the Dr. wanted to do an endoscopy to make sure nothing was in the tract. After the endoscopy, at 4:00pm I ate solid food. I was able to swallow since 11:30am when they gave me the medicine. But then they put me again to wait in a room and they came at 7:00-8:00pm to tell there is another shift and that the Dr left and that know I need to wait until next day to be discharged because the Dr is not here.

There is no communication with the patient about the real intentions. They just say you need to wait or there is a shift happening. Im ready to leave since 12:00. They wanted to do the endoscopy, ok, Im ready to leave since 4:00. Why are they retaining me. Will this overnight stay be free????

I was DX with a very rare subtype of AML in 2011.  After 3 failed rounds of chemo I had the choice of them keeping me comfortable until I passed or take part in a clinical trial.  Since either could kill me why not try one more chance so I chose trial.

57,review_43517,Payne Barksdale,1,"I’m writing to express my deep concern and disappointment with my mother’s recent overnight visit to your hospital. Unfortunately, this experience along with several previous encounters has left us extremely unsettled.

My 70-year-old mother was admitted for a 3-night, 2-day stay to monitor her response to a new heart medication. She has a history of irregular heartbeats, and over the last two years, her heart health has declined significantly, partly due to medication changes. Initially, she had an extra heartbeat. Now, her heart has weakened, despite treatment.

During this visit, her care involved multiple doctors, including Dr. Rodger (Sr. Resident), Dr. McLaughlin (Attending), Dr. Armson, and Dr. Arps/Joly (EP). My concerns lie in the inconsistent approach they took. My mother was given different blood pressure medications (Dyazide and Triamterene), which deviated from what she takes at home and led to her heart rate falling into a dangerous zone.

She was started on Sotalol, which quickly caused severe side effects, leading to its discontinuation. The next choice was 800mg of Amiodarone an extremely high starting dose rather than starting low and monitoring her body’s response. We were told that the higher dose would allow her to be discharged with medication, while the lower dose required another overnight stay. That rationale makes little sense to me, especially when her safety is at stake.

The constant medication switching and what feels like “medical guessing” has caused great stress and uncertainty. We stayed longer than we were told, and no real solution was provided. I’ve sought second opinions, but nearly every provider refers us back to U of M, which is said to be the best. Yet our experience does not reflect that reputation.

My mother deserves a clear, safe, and consistent care plan. We deserve better communication, more thoughtful treatment decisions, and a medical team that truly listens. I hope this feedback is taken seriously for the sake of all patients, not just my mother.",5 months ago,2025-05-31,1,en,University_of_Michigan_Health,University_of_Michigan_Health.csv,2025-05-31,2031,0.06350468975468974,0.3693145743145743,Neutral,0.9876,0.069,0.788,0.143,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

U of M will NOT code it as an ASC for insurance purposes and will bill you the cost of hospitalization which is a very substantial dollar difference. Your paperwork from U of M will say it's being done at a ASC but they will say it doesn't matter, they consider all of their services to fall under hospitalization. Under my specific insurance plan and the outpatient surgery I was doing, the cost difference was $250 (ASC) vs. $33,000. U of M let me know 10 days before my scheduled procedure what the cost was going to be; we have been waiting a year to do this surgery so cancelling/finding another ASC to do this was unfortunately not a solution to us. This surgery was fertility related. U of M said they would take my complaint and let higher up know because I was right and agreed that it was misleading however, they couldn't do anything about it because that's not how U of M bills.

95,review_14226,Mirrion W.,3,"My recent visit with my son has been less than pleasurable. At 2:30am my son was taken to the ICU, Im a single mother with another child who is 6 years old. We arrived to the ER at 4:00pm. Once he was taken to the ICU, I was repeatedly questioned about leaving or having someone pick her up and how I need to understand that if she stays that night it won’t be acceptable in the future. While I understand the policy, It was 2:30am! No one in the ER even let me know he was being admitted until I asked what was going on at midnight, so it just seemed highly unreasonable to be pressuring an obviously tired mom with a sleeping 6 year old and a child that is moving to the ICU to leave or find someone to pick up my 6 year old so late in the night, then once the exception was made rather than just letting me know she can stay for the night, I was asked again “so there’s absolutely no one who can pick her up”, well she can stay to night but moving forward this can’t happen again. #1 I’m not a child, #2 what shouldn’t happen again is the sheer lack of communication, If the care team actually took the time to stop and explain what was happening perhaps I could have secured someone earlier. The whole visit, I had to request updates, the care team would come in and act like I wasn’t there with the exception of the PICU doctor Steve. My son was barely given a pillow or blanket during his first 8 hours there. Because he was heavily medicated, and tired, he had an accident and rather than putting the blankets in the soiled area, they were left in the chair where visitors sit. When I brought this to the supervisor Rachelle, she said but they weren’t touching him….. There were multiple condescending remarks made by the care team and when I spoke to her about the incident with my daughter, she thought it was acceptable to tell me to get it out of my head that I’m being judged and I just need to let my guard down. My son has come to U OF M on many occasions and I’m generally happy most times but on this occasion the behavior and care was simply lackluster. I’m unsure if there is a staffing issue, perhaps people are overworked but respect while doing such an important job should not be compromised.

Now it is probably taking so long because they are really observing the scans or at least I hope that's what they are doing, but they need to communicate a lot more, ive maybe seen the doctors 4 times since i've been here.

Also havent eaten anything for 13 hours because they said I need to have a clear stomach and I asked one of the doctors to check if I could eat but they never came back.

I would take your medical emergencies to a different hospital unless you are in a rush or need care right away.

EDIT: <12 hour visit, actually impressive how slow they are working, this is not making sure anymore. They HAVE to be just talking or something.

EDIT TWO: Finally leaving this hospital after staying for 13+ hours. There is a sign that says ""Give Respect, Get Respect"" which is a useless sign because you can tell the passive aggression in their voices when they talk to you.

In conclusion, take your medical emergencies elsewhere unless you have a whole day to give and get barely anything done.",11 months ago,2024-12-02,1,en,University_of_Michigan_Health,University_of_Michigan_Health.csv,2024-12-02,1138,0.09365079365079365,0.41155202821869497,Neutral,0.949,0.038,0.857,0.105,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

122,review_70494,Briana W,2,"Spent an entire day in the ER for them to tell me they have no idea what's wrong with me. They gave me a referral for a specialist, noting the wait can be long so I should probably look for an outside provider. The wait is EIGHT MONTHS. So I ask for the referral to be sent to an outside provider, as THEY instructed me to do. I am told they cannot do that. The referral is only for their own specialists. I must wait EIGHT MONTHS.

This is after another terrible communication where they told me I cannot see a PCP for SIX MONTHS for a follow-up for an urgent care visit. Someone told me since the PCP can't see me, the OBGYN should be able to. I called the OBGYN and they told me they don't do that and acted like I was crazy for doing something THEY told me to do.

You clearly have a number of problems in this health system. 1) You cannot actually see patients. If you can see them in 6 to 8 months for an urgent issue, it is the same as not seeing them at all. 2) You clearly have communication and policy-knowledge issues, since I keep being instructed by your staff to do something that someone else says I am not allowed to do. 3) The ER wasn't helpful in telling me they didn't know what the issue was and made of point of saying ""it's not their job to diagnose,"" and since I wasn't literally dying on the floor, it's not their problem to solve. I was there for eight hours for practically nothing to be done except a blood draw and the doctors shrugging their shoulders at me. Seeing someout outside the ER, as you suggest, would make more sense if I COULD actually see a doctor in this system outside of the ER, but obviously I cannot unless I want to wait nearly a year.",Edited 11 months ago,2024-12-02,1,en,University_of_Michigan_Health,University_of_Michigan_Health.csv,2024-12-02,1683,-0.01666666666666666,0.4400793650793651,Neutral,0.0721,0.036,0.921,0.043,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

45,review_32230,jabeen syed,1,"My father was diagnosed with stage 4 oral cancer at this hospital in January 2024. At the time, aside from some difficulty opening his mouth, he was otherwise in good health and full of life. Sadly, he passed away in June 2024—just five months after starting treatment here.

According to his death certificate, he died due to respiratory failure. But as someone who was by his side every step of the way, I truly believe his health rapidly declined after he began chemotherapy and radiation therapy—treatments that, given the severity and progression of his cancer, were unlikely to improve his condition. Yet, these were the treatments strongly advised by his medical team.

I understand that every illness is complex and outcomes can be unpredictable. I also believe in God’s plan and that some things are simply beyond our control. But I also believe that in moments like these, the guidance and decisions made by doctors are critical. In my father’s case, I feel that he was given the wrong advice—treatments that did more harm than good. Watching him suffer through the side effects of aggressive therapy, only to lose him shortly after, was heartbreaking.

I’m not a medical professional, and I don’t pretend to have all the answers. But I share this in the hope that it encourages reflection among those in the medical field. Please consider each patient’s quality of life and unique situation when offering treatment recommendations. Sometimes, the best care is not the most aggressive option—but the most compassionate one.

This experience has been incredibly painful for our family, and I hope no one else has to endure the same.",6 months ago,2025-05-01,1,en,NYU_Langone_Hospitals,NYU_Langone_Hospitals.csv,2025-05-01,1641,0.07592592592592592,0.49779541446208114,Neutral,0.4399,0.158,0.688,0.155,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

I recently went to Penn in the ER. The wait was not bad they got me back in about 20mins despite the waiting room being pretty full. I was in the ER then the ICU then a regular admitted room and through all of that every Dr and nurse that treated me were all amazing. They were very compassionate and sympathetic they gave me excellent care and resources. I Don't remember everyone's name but Luana🌟 the Er nurse was amazing as well as the Dr in the Er I forget his name though sorry I think it began with an N like nicosta or something close to that he was so sympathetic. And the Drs and nurses when I was admitted were so wonderful, Stephanie🌟, sarah(?), Alex🌟, Agnes, Joana(?), and Luke🌟 the medicine Dr was amazing he really listened to my needs and accommodated me accordingly I never felt overlooked or under treated during my stay like I have at other hospitals. Jennifer and Jeff were so helpful as well. Even though Penn hospital was at capacity while I was there you would never know it by their treatment. It's worth going out of ur way to go to this hospital if u Don't live nearby because u will get better care and they are ahead of other philly hospitals with their cutting edge research and treatments. You will get better care here than other philly hospitals like Nazareth and Jefferson and even templei have been to all of them in the past year and I choose to go to Penn even though its out of my way to get the best treatment and the best care from their team of Drs and nurses. I apologize to those whose names I forgot.

OLD REVIEW (FEB 2025)
Whatever you do DONT let them ""hold"" any of ur valuables because it's likely you won't get them back. I gave them my money, cards and a few other things to lock up and keep ""safe"" only to find out at my discharge that they ""couldn't be found""🙄🤔🤨
And I'm really upset to have to give them only 3 stars because of this issue because most everything else was good. I came in thru the ER and they got me right back despite having a full waiting room because I was having chest pains and shortness of breath I was afraid I had a heart attack. Immediately I could see the place was very clean which says a lot because this hospital is HUGE so that's no small task to keep clean. The nurses, CNAs and Drs were good i wish could remember all their names but I was there for almost 2wks and saw a lot of them Davida RN, Kylie RN, Margaret RN, Keisha? CNA, Annabelle the social worker, and there was a couple Drs I can't remember their names but especially one asian Dr on the addiction team I had long conversations with he really took the time to try to understand what is going on with the current drug epidemic. I'm sorry to the ones whose names I forgot.  The food was great, I actually GAINED weight there instead of losing weight like usual during hospital visits. The food services workers were top notch especially Joan (I hope I'm spelling his name right) and miss Vera were both very friendly. Joan even took the time to assist a nurse with a patient who was having a bit of an episode. He deserves a raise because he goes above and beyond.
They could be a little more giving with the amount of pain meds they give out but that's all hospitals anymore really.

I would like to extend a special commendation to my nurse, Amy Cornal, RN. Her care was exemplary in every way. Not only did she provide excellent medical attention, but she also showed a level of compassion that deeply moved me, especially the night before my stress test.

Understanding that I would be fasting, Amy created a detailed plan to ensure I would be as comfortable as possible and avoid hunger and headaches. She thoughtfully brought me coffee and a sandwich as soon as it was medically permissible. This gesture was so kind and considerate, and it meant the world to me.

Amy consistently worked hard and went far above and beyond my expectations. She is a wonderful representative of the high standards of your hospital. I would give her performance five stars—or even ten stars if I could!

Please recognize Amy for her incredible work and compassion. Thank you for fostering an environment where such dedicated and thoughtful professionals thrive.

Sincerely,

As soon as you walk in, you’re greeted with an extremely small waiting room for a Hospital of this size. Crammed packed like sardines in a can. There are flies everywhere. Receptionist and staff yelling names. No type of patient confidentiality or HIPPA protections. They’re asking personal medical information in plain open site. Treatment area is also open to all(unless they have you in a room) with no sense of  privacy or urgency. These Red chairs they have people sitting in waiting for Labs in the hallways is unacceptable. For this to be a new facility, they definitely didn’t plan their Emergency Department properly. It’s giving public Hospital vibes. Penn medicine needs to do better. Definitely not impressed.

I spoke with 2 specialist and one transplant surgeon in the Liver transplant division of the hospital. I also spoke to the many assistants and PA’s of those specialists. They were all great and within a few hours of meeting me put all their heads together and came up with a game plan for me and my family. They were awesome. Getting back to the surgery, I was told everything went great and to just listen to your doctors and nurses. Well that I did and it was almost painless. I would personally like to thank my physicians and their teams, please forgive me for not knowing all the name. . Dr Hoteit, Dr Abt, the RI doc who consulted with us in the beginning. And all their team members, especially Leah. Also want to thank the Anesthesiologist and his team also. I had an epidural placed and it made all the difference in the world. Now to the people who cared for me from Wednesday to Saturday every minute I was in there. Jean was who I woke up to and she was literally a site for sore eyes.  Here are the other competent, professional nurses I had were Andrew, Angela (2 shifts) and Mia. Obviously they are all different people but all of them were really compassionate, professional and committed. I retired from emergency services and my daughter is a nurse. I was so happy to be treated by people who I know have been through the ringer many times still have the kindness to do the job with a smile on their faces and that desire to help and serve others. Can’t say enough, it was awesome! Also can’t say enough about the hospital itself. It’s a state of the art place and the rooms are amazing and spotless. Anyway just had to put my two cents in on this and thank you for making a really nerve racking situation go as smoothly as possible for me and my family. Thanks again!

Although communication with the doctor's are limited, I had full faith in the doctor's decisions and their knowledge on how to treat him and save his life. I was the one approving procedures and treatments on my dad's behalf and when I finally did get a call from the doctor they made sure to explain the situation thoroughly to help me understand what was happening and what the plan of action was going forward. When he was finally moved from the ICU after 50 days, the nurses carefully removed all of the pictures and decorations we had hung up for him, moved them to his new room, and re-hung all of the pictures up for him to see and enjoy. As an added bonus, the rooms that aren't in the ICU are beautiful. They are huge and include things like an actual pull out bed, a huge tv, a mini fridge, a beautiful bathroom, and his view from the room (not in the ICU) is stunning. I don't know how much the bill will be, but I couldn't put a price on my dad's life and his comfort.

71,review_94315,Celeste Logue,1,"I am writing to formally express my concerns about the substandard care and medical management provided to my mother during her stay at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). The following issues are of grave concern:

1. Overmedication and Lack of Proper Consultation: My mother was overmedicated with heart medication, without proper consultation with cardiology. Instead, a medical resident was involved in providing care that I believe to be negligent.

2. Unnecessary Restraints and Injuries: The nursing staff unnecessarily restrained my elderly mother, resulting in visible bruises on her wrists. This treatment was not only unjustified but also inhumane.

3. Inadequate Nutritional and Hydration Care: Despite my mother being able to eat, food was withheld for over a week. Additionally, her IV hydration needs were not met adequately, which contributed to her suffering.

4. Denied Transfer Request: I requested that my mother be transferred to Thomas Jefferson Hospital, yet my request was denied by Penn without a valid reason.

5. Improper Hospice Referral: HUP sent an unnecessary hospice referral despite my mother's non-terminal condition. Efforts to reverse this referral were unsuccessful and further compounded her distress.

6. Lack of Action from the Department of Health: I reported these concerns to the Department of Health, but unfortunately, no action was taken to address the situation.

My mother endured horrific and inhumane treatment during her time at HUP, and it is deeply troubling that her needs were not met in a manner that respects her dignity and well-being. I urge you to thoroughly investigate these matters and ensure that proper corrective actions are taken to prevent such negligence in the future.

My mother sadly died under the care of Penn Medicine Hospice. She would have been alive today, if not placed against her will on hospice and given meds not aligned with her medical needs.

8,review_13265,Jake Danishevsky,5,"I began my journey with Hackensack about a year ago. At first, they reached out several times, but I wasn’t yet mentally or physically ready to move forward with a transplant. Then, around five months ago, in February, I made the decision to reactivate myself on the list. The calls resumed, though initially not for the right match. I knew I needed a kidney transplant, but I also knew I had to be patient and make sure everything aligned with what I truly wanted long-term. After multiple consultations with their staff and doctors, we agreed on a plan—and then the calls paused again, as they waited for the exact criteria I had requested. And then, it happened—the perfect call came in. It was exactly what I had been waiting for, and the process officially began.

Hackensack had always been my first choice, but even then, I underestimated just how incredible this facility and its people truly are. From start to finish, everything—from the quality of information, level of service, and care—was flawless. They listened, they understood my unique needs, and they treated me not just as a patient, but as a whole person. This is what true healthcare should look like.

From the moment I walked into the facility, I was met with kindness, attentiveness, and a level of professionalism that exceeded all expectations. Just when I thought they had reached the peak of patient care, they went even further. I’m someone who has a very difficult time with any medical procedure—I can faint just hearing about them. When I say I need sedation even for the smallest things, it’s not a preference—it’s a necessity. They not only respected that but anticipated and accommodated it with care and empathy at every step.

The check-in and check-out processes, follow-ups, and every interaction along the way were handled with the highest standard of care. The doctors are approachable and genuinely listen. They answer questions with patience and provide reassurance and clarity. I feel truly blessed to have been cared for by such a remarkable team. While I would love to name each doctor, nurse, and staff member, there are simply too many to mention. From the medical team to the food service, pharmacy, and even the cleaning staff—everyone was exceptional.

Thank you to every single person who played a role in my care. I am deeply grateful and look forward to continuing my recovery with Hackensack by my side.

(Update 10/28/2025) - October 9, 2025 — Today marks my three-month kidneyversary, and while I’m celebrating it back in the hospital, I’m filled with gratitude and optimism. This past month has been quite a rollercoaster, but I truly feel blessed to have such an incredible team of medical professionals and a facility dedicated to my care and progress. I’m in both their hands and God’s hands—and I fully trust the process.

A few weeks ago, I developed some fluid buildup, and on September 25th, a drain was placed to help remove it. It wasn’t easy carrying it around, but it was a small price to pay for recovery. I was thrilled when my doctor removed it on October 2nd. Shortly after, I developed a hematoma in my abdomen, which lingered for a few weeks—uncomfortable, but again, just another small step in the journey.

When my creatinine levels became unstable, the team ordered a biopsy on October 3rd. By October 7th, the results showed a very mild rejection. Without hesitation, they had me admitted right away to begin a three-day course of IV anti-rejection medication. What amazes me most is how proactive and attentive this team is—they never leave anything to chance. Every concern is addressed immediately, and their 24/7 support gives me peace of mind knowing I’m never alone in this process.

12,review_32024,Michelle Emme,1,"TLDR: DO NOT step a foot into this negligent hospital. I came in at 11:00 pm to the ER and waited in the waiting room for 3 hours before I was taken in. The receptionist at the front was terrible; she didn’t let me finish telling my symptoms before she sent me to get an EKG (with a woman who didn’t even look at me or acknowledge me). After the 3 hours, i was in, they put me on a stretcher IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALLWAY where about 10+ other patients were, and were basically ignored all night and no one tended to them. I wasn’t seen for another hour, and after the doctor asked for my symptoms and a urine sample, he left, and i didn’t see him again until 5 AM. Then another woman came for insurance information, and finally about 2 hours after a nurse came to take care of me. She was the only thing that made anything better, and was very kind, walking me through everything she was doing. However, I assume it was busy because she disappeared for about 2 hours and left me hooked up to liquids and on valium. Many nurses passed by and no one stopped to help me or talk to me. I was never put in a room, i was left in the hallway for hours. I had an IV of liquids, and so i had to use the bathroom often. There was no one there to unhook me. The very few nurses around kept talking about how they didn’t want to be there, and gossiping /laughing amongst themselves. All that needed to happen at that point was to unhook me from the fluids and take my vitals. It took ANOTHER 2 hours for anyone to see me.

13,review_89723,Hansen Villatoro,1,"Too long, don't want to read? Hackensack University Medical Center's Neuropsychology Team fails its most vulnerable patients with ADHD and Adult Autism. Steer clear of ER care for autistic/psych patients and go to Englewood Hospital instead.

I am rewriting this because my first review did not capture the high-risk factors Hackensack Meridian Health ignored, or could have asked about.

On paper... I should have been prioritized or at least seen.... I already had a “North Bergen Pediatrics” marker on my chart within the legacy primary care systems' HMH had usurped.
I am super super high-risk and in need of neuropsychology at UMHC, and on Medicaid. I came with five medical referrals: four from outside doctors (Englewood Health Neurology, an independent PMHNP, a Holy Name NP and their MD supervisor) and one internal referral from HMH Palisades Primary Care. My family history is pretty high-risk: my mom has schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, my dad has suspected autism.

Despite that, I hit a wall. Calling the number for Hackensack University Medical Center never reaches the actual office. It goes to an answering person, that only ""takes a message"" When a nurse finally called back, I was told: “We aren't accepting any outside referrals, you must already be referred from within.” When I asked for help, the call was hung up on. Every other route I tried was the same story: no Medicaid accepted, or pay thousands up front out of network.

Yet even despite that, other patients had easily posted reviews for the same doctors that were “not accepting outside referrals”, and got care days-weeks, even months after I had called.

Patient Experience contacted me twice. Both times were the same intake and the same apology. No solutions. No accountability.

Here is the part patients need to know. There is a split between the HMH Neuroscience Institute neuropsychology team and the private neurodevelopmental clinics run by some of the same providers, like Elizabeth Kera, PhD, the head of Neuropsychology. Those private clinics do not take insurance and cater to families who can pay high fees. Yet HMH's own directory still lists those private clinics as numbers to call, while most other doctors only list the Neuroscience Institute or those same private clinics as the contact point.

In practice, it looks like this: wealthier patients pay privately for an autism evaluation first, then use that diagnosis to access follow-up care within HMH and bill insurance or Medicaid. Patients like me, who cannot afford the private assessment, are blocked at the front door.

Hackensack Meridian Health, specifically the neuropsychology department at HUMC, did not prioritize or help an autistic/ADHD patient with clear risk factors and multiple referrals. It felt like a two-tier system that rewards people who can pay cash and shuts out those who cannot. I cannot say or comment on the experience of even stepping into the place to get care; and I hope this review can help others steer clear.

If it is so hard to even receive care for Autism/Neurodevelopmental disorders at this place, imagine how it will be to bring Autistic patients for care in other places at HMH (ER? other care? I don't trust it now....) it's really shameful to me and others to see how HMH neglects it's most needy population.",Edited a week ago,2025-10-21,1,en,Hackensack_University_Medical_Center,Hackensack_University_Medical_Center.csv,2025-10-21,3313,0.04988304093567252,0.3564035087719298,Neutral,0.9922,0.077,0.786,0.137,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

The hospital staff are trying to minimize this threat as people arguing but nothing justifies it especially the damage that came with the threat from Walter.

How is me saying you’re not going to speak to my mother any sort of way threatening? We still have to go there for her post op appointments and we’re expected to be comfortable walking into a hospital that allows someone to threaten a patient and their family member? That is not only a crime but illegal for him to do.

The ER was a disaster and they had me go from waiting room to waiting room. I was sitting upright in a bed for maybe 20 min max and then back to the waiting room. They gave me so many different meds and IV drips and nothing was helping. In the end, they basically gave me a drug that made me feel loopy, but didn't help alleviate the nausea and discharged me. Then they charged me $7500 for making me sit in a cold waiting room for 7 hours and giving me a bunch of IV fluids so I don't die. I left the hospital not feeling any better than when I first got there. Not only that, billing has been an absolute nightmare. I had 2 insurances which they weren't billing properly. I called them 8+ times only to have the phone outsourced to the Philippines and they didn't know what they were talking about. They kept telling me to wait 4-6 weeks for a resolution between each call. Long story short, they sent me a bill, I financed the balance with Commerce bank. A couple months ago, they refunded Commerce bank the full amount financed and I received a refund from Commerce for the amount I paid so far.

75,review_55645,Shanerri Champion,2,"So for starters i'll start off with the cons :
For the most part the staff / nurses & surgeon
were very passive aggressive toward me being in excruciating pain. I had an emergency Gallbladder removal which is very painful to recover from. I know that there has been a few cases of people having a fast healing process from this surgery but I am not one of them nor am I the first or last! My abdominal area was completely sore to the point where I couldnt move that much even if I tried. I expressed this to the doctor and instead of him being empathetic towards my pain he made a mockery of it. Saying ""well usually people heal very quickly"" and that he knew someone that went to the work the same day. Kudos to them but respectfully , I dont give a damn that is not how you treat a patient , period!

Secondly , I was greeted literally the day after my surgery with a loud nursing assistant that was yelling at me to get out of bed and to sit up in a chair. I've done a lot of research on this procedure im damn near obsessed with the ""ends and outs"" because its my new reality! Yes , moving and allowing my body to get some type of motion is important! However, why was I being spoken to as if I didn't just have a surgery done (an organ taking out of my body). Then , to make matters worse she offered no assistance to help me get out of bed at all! All she did was slap a white cottony binder to support my body across the room!

Thirdly , I think its very important to mention that I am a Black woman and yes this plays a big part on how im treated. No matter how kind or receptive I am I'm still unfortunately met with harmful micro aggressive BS! Another thing I also expressed to them is that my current living quarters has a eight flight walk up with no elevator! Guess what! They had me walk up a whole bunch of stairs for ""physical therapy"".

Lastly , The surgeon discharged me without my consent. I know that insurance plays a big part in this which is why I do have it! ;  But these clowns didnt even put my card in the system! So the whole entire time I was listed as a non insured patient. I told him that I am a single woman and I just need a few more days to heal and he went right along and discharged me ! No sentiments or anything! My whole experience after surgery just seemed very robotic and sad. Also , I have to mention that I was told prior to the procedure that I wouldn't be rushed out and that they would totally understand if I needed more time.

Now lets get into the Pros:

The pros are the hospital room looked very much like a hotel. Big window to enjoy sunrises and sunsets, big flat screen TV , Impeccably clean room and a bathroom that was inside of my assigned room as well. Also , the TV had a variety of channels making my stay somewhat bearable. Another pro was the food. It was  definitely edible and they had a feature that allowed you to order food up once you scanned the QR Code.

Aesthetically my room didnt feel like a hospital room at all I felt like I was in a 3-4 star hotel that had a hospital bed in it. I appreciated that!

Also , the first nurse I was assigned to was very caring and had a real personality. Unfortunately, I was in too much pain to get everyone's name but ill definitely be doing a full YouTube video on my experience and including the surgeons name for sure! I also plan on talking to a patient advocate tomorrow.",3 months ago,2025-07-30,1,en,Hackensack_University_Medical_Center,Hackensack_University_Medical_Center.csv,2025-07-30,3387,0.07489816194734226,0.438764341305325,Neutral,0.9784,0.089,0.793,0.118,Positive,Negative (1-2★),False,False

They couldn’t get the port in the normal spot so they ended up placing it in her neck. Shortly after they began chemo her eye swelled shut and they couldn’t figure out the cause or how to treat it. She then started to complain of having trouble breathing. All the doctors brushed it off telling her it was normal and it was anxiety. It got to the point that she couldn’t get out of bed without having a massive panic attack because she could not breathe when she stood up. They gaslit her and told her it was all in her head and to push through. She then died suddenly in the middle of the night, and the hospital did not want to perform an autopsy. Instead they asked us to sign a form to test her for Covid that basically said if she tested positive it would be ruled her cause of death. We refused to sign and instead pushed for an autopsy that we would pay for. The autopsy revealed her cause of death was fluid in her chest cavity, multiple cups full of it, that led to her heart stopping. So for weeks she complained she could not breathe, they gaslit her saying it was in her head and upped her anxiety meds, and then she ended up dying from their lack of intervention.

87,review_92720,Ana M,4,"Review from visit on July 2023. Everyone, literally everyone was very nice, helpful, super kind and caring. I am greatful and super thankful for Dr. Ditkowsky (supervising DR) and his team amazing, including Dr. Patrick (Resident DR) they were an AMAZING TEAM, I was super fortunate to have gotten them as my care team during my visit.

I also did notice how Dr. Ditkowsky treated his group of Resident Doctors, with such respect, kindness and trust.

There were 3 things I disliked about my visit:

1: My discharge forms state my BP was 170/65 (never! In my life had my BP gone over 130, I am always on the lower side) when the last ER TECH/Nurse took my vitals both my husband and I saw it at 120/65, the ER TECH wrote in a piece of paper too.

I walked in to HUMC my initial vitals show my BP at 107/(over something I can not recall) and for it to shoot to 170 during my ER visit, that is not normal, the that fact that it was overlooked, is upsetting. How could I be let out of the hospital with a BP that was at 109 when I walked in and shooting up to 170 within hours?

What makes me more upset, is that it is now noted in EPIC as part of my BP history and it is not accurate at all for future providers treating me at this hospital or any offices affiliated.

I understand this could have been an honest error, they probably put someone else’s BP in my chart but they should’ve realized this big error and fixed it promptly.

I am assuming it should have gone through MULTIPLE eyes prior to me being discharged, the ER TECH (took the vitals), nurse should have supervised it, treating Doctors should have triple supervised it prior to being discharged, unfortunately it was to late when I noticed, I was in my car and going back home (although I though about returning to the hospital and making them aware).

2: This I am 50/50 on but my bloodwork was drawn at 4:00pm, the nurse put it behind my bed in case the DR ordered blood work which I know they didn’t (or at least it was not mentioned to me).

I checked behind my bed around 11:00p (which was supposed to be my initial discharge time) my blood was still behind me.

I ended up getting discharged at around 1:00a due to excruciating pain I experienced during the initial 11:00p discharge attempt.

How does my discharge papers have blood work results when at 11:00p my blood work was still behind me…..on my bed?

This is why I am 50/50, maybe the nurse took it after 11:00p, realizing it was never sent for testing. But to be honest, I am not 100% sure being I did not check after.

Reading the blood work today, I compared it with a recent bloodwork the week prior, some off the numbers that should be off (that have been off and abnormal for months) were normal.

3: I was taken from the ER waiting to Area E where I was put on a stretcher and wheeled over. The poor ER ETCH did not know where to put me (it was a Monday and super, super busy) finally we found a spot! she put in front of the door of the “Shock, Trauma and Resuscitation” department.

As the night continued a lot of the rooms became available but yet no one in the hall was being moved to these available rooms.

But I figured there are probably a lot patients in the ER waiting area and it is easier to put them directly in a room than transferring the patients from the halls to the rooms having to update the charts, can cause confusion between the nurses and Doctors.

When I left at 1:00a, I walked a little and notice A LOT of rooms empty, the ER waiting area died down a lot and it was much less busier for the nurses in Area E, that would have been a great time to make these patients in the hall way much more comfortable to vomit, complain loudly about there pain, cough etc. in a much more private room.

But again, the Doctors and Staff were extremely amazing and I am super happy with the care, compassion, bed-side manner and kindness of everyone!

88,review_41548,Anna D,5,"I would like to express my deepest gratitude to HMH Bariatric and Women’s Health for the exceptional care I received throughout my recent surgical journey.

I underwent robotic gynecologic surgery performed by Dr. Adam Shoman, and I can confidently say he is one of the most skilled, compassionate, and dedicated physicians in the country. From my very first appointment, Dr. Shoman took the time to listen, explain, and reassure me. His calm demeanor and expertise gave me complete confidence and peace of mind.

His incredible team mirrored that same excellence. From the clinic to the hospital stay and all the way through discharge, I felt genuinely supported and cared for every step of the way.

In the PACU, Nurse Victoria was a comforting and nurturing presence. Her kindness and attentiveness during my immediate recovery meant so much to me. On the surgical floor, Nurses Mary and Jennifer were outstanding—proactive, knowledgeable, and deeply compassionate.

A special thank you to Maggie, Daniella, and Ismenia, the nursing assistants who stayed by my side during the most difficult parts of my recovery. Their patience, care, and encouragement helped me more than words can express.

If you are seeking minimally invasive gynecologic surgery, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Shoman and his team. Their expertise, warmth, and patient-centered approach make all the difference.
Thank you .

94,review_28827,Monique mckenzie,1,"Let me start by saying as a medical professional myself, this is by far the worse hospital, very disappointed with how I got treated a week ago. I went to the ER on 6/11/25 with labor pains, they checked and I was 3cm dilated, I was given Tylenol  IV and IV fluids and was sent home regardless of me telling them the Tylenol didn’t work, I was sent home in pain. On Friday 6/13/25 the pain got so intense, my doctor sent me back to the ER, given Tylenol again and again I told them it’s not working and I was still 3cm dilated. No one listens to me and as a FTM, I was hoping to get a better care.
They were going to send me home until my baby’s HR starts dropping, my doctor told them to monitor me overnight. I asked them if I can get something stronger because obviously no one believes that I was contracting. Epidural wasn’t offered, they told me I can Morphine and because i trust these professionals and I was in so much pain, I took it and that’s the option. Unbelievable.
Saturday 6/14/25, I woke up with more intense pain, I felt like my water broke, I asked the nurse and she said “no it can be from the cervix check from the night before “. I was so uncomfortable, the pain was 1min long. The NP came in to do a 30 mins US for fluids, while I was in pain.i kept asking them for something for the pain, nothing was offered, they told me to wait on my doctor to come in to see me. I’m crying while writing this right now.
I waited and waited in pain. NOTHING. I went on the toilet, I saw mucus plug with some blood, again I don’t know what this means so I asked the nurse and she kept saying it’s from the cervix check. I found myself pushing on the toilet when the pain starts, the nurse told me to lay in bed and my doctor walked in same time, cervix check me right away, the baby’s head was right there. I went straight into another room to deliver.
My point is this was negligence, and my pain was dismissive.

Then she was moved to the 3rd floor first night was fine and the 2 day I started exercising her right side and tried to get her to talk she was on a bed pan for over 2-3 hours. Her albuterol mask was on her bed laying there.  Which should be changed.  I sterilized instruments so I know about this stuff.  I let the nurse know hey my mom is sitting in urine and diarrhea she had another nurse come in and change her I helped her clean my mother. Then her oxygen dropped and I’m sitting waiting nobody came so I put her oxygen on and suctioned her mouth because I’m a dental assistant I don’t mind helping.  My neighbor went up and noticed nobody was turning her.  ICU was great always on time.  So I ended up staying everyday for hours to see what was happening again left in diarrhea.   I started to clean it cause every nurse was in a room nobody was around.  This is not okay.  I told the charge nurse and she was very sorry.  I can tell these nurses are extremely exhausted and frustrated some nice some tired get them help.  Also some guy dropped his glove on the floor and then proceeded to put it on to check my mother down there.  Like my life is in shambles.  I sit in her room from 12pm to midnight and I barely see the nurses I have to grab them and I feel so bad cause there is not enough nurses 5 pt’s to 1 nurse??? That’s insane.

My husband underwent a heart catheterization on February 20/2025, that was preauthorized by our cardiologist, covering all expected procedures. However, during the procedure, a clot was discovered, and a stent was necessary. I promptly requested post-authorization for this additional procedure, which was granted a month later.
Instead of accurately processing the necessary claims with the correctly authorized CPT codes, the billing/coding team submitted completely different codes for the same procedures, resulting in a denied claim from our insurance. Even after the doctor submitted a request to correct the CPT codes, it feels like they were met with a wall of indifference. To make matters worse, we have now received a statement demanding an outrageous $17,490! This overwhelming amount for a procedure that was supposed to be covered has caused us immense stress during an already difficult time. I understand that billing can sometimes be complicated, but the apparent lack of communication and disregard from the billing department is unacceptable.

At one point, the doctor openly admitted to forgetting to discharge us on time. The nursing staff, unfortunately, seemed even more careless.

When my dad and I brought my unconscious mom to the emergency drop-off area seeking urgent medical attention, we were met with hostility and disbelief. The security guards and ambulance staff screamed at us, saying we couldn't park there, despite the critical situation we were facing.

For 3 to 5 agonizing minutes, we pleaded for help until some nurses finally came out to assist. This unacceptable response from the security and ambulance personnel highlights the need for better training and awareness in handling emergencies with compassion and urgency. Their behavior was not only unprofessional but distressing during an already stressful moment.

That being said, I must express my gratitude to the nurses and doctors who eventually stepped in to provide care for my mom.

136,review_29060,Gustavo Goncalves,1,"On February 14, 2025, I visited the Emergency Room at Hackensack Meridian Health Pascack Valley Medical Center for high blood pressure. The staff performed an electrocardiogram (ECG), a flu test, and checked my blood pressure. My visit lasted just one hour.

A month later, I received a bill for $3,066.81, which was shocking given the minimal services provided. When I called for clarification, a representative named Kevin simply stated that it was ""the law"" and that I had to pay—without offering any explanation. I later spoke with a supervisor, Stephanie, who provided no real assistance beyond sending an itemized bill. To my disbelief, an additional charge of $1,166.00 was added shortly after, bringing the total to $4,232.81 for a one-hour visit.

Nearly two months later, the hospital administration has done nothing to address this issue. Instead, they continue to send payment reminders, ignoring any concerns about the outrageous charges. The lack of transparency and accountability is alarming.

143,review_73274,Julanne NIkanorov,1,"Just an overall bad experience with my Dad.  This is supposed to be one of the best hospitals. What a joke.  The ER is like a 3rd world country.  Just shameful to see people in the hallway in beds with zero privacy because rooms are all taken up. The floors are filthy.  I'm surprised with all the money this hospital has that they can't provide a bigger ER to accommodate the population. The care he received in the ER wasn't great. Seems like you have to beg to be admitted for workup. My Dad first presented with abdominal pain (very bad) and CT showed hydronephrosis and he has an extensive history of cancer. They sent him home with Opioids! That's their answer.  He came back a week later with same pain - told him he had to follow-up with urologist and gave him antibiotics for a UTI.  3rd time's a charm with these guys - finally admitted him!!  Turns out he had stage IV colon cancer to his urinary tract!!!!  Time was precious here and they ignored him.  He should have went for cystoscopy IN HOUSE the first time and this would have been discovered sooner. Doctor's don't care here. They walk in all high and mighty in their white coats to make a buck.  Dr. Guterriez's oncology team doesn't have great bedside manner. His nurse called me to discuss his care and I got yes/no answers - seemed like she didn't even want to be on the phone - not a good vibe at all. I also witnessed an asian doctor who saw my Dad on the weekend while I was visiting.  He was just the fill-in doc for the weekend and knew NOTHING about my Dads case!!! Don't you review the record before entering a patient's room?!?!  He started asking questions about what's going on, are you on chemotherapy?, etc.  So unprofessional and not prepared.  The one day my day had to go to radiation, he was wheeled to the elevator and could not get on for 45 minutes because construction workers were moving things from different floors. Aren't patient's the priority here?!  Just awful.  The nursing staff for the most part was great - these professionals deserve so much more. Overall, I would never recommend this place to anyone.

then my mother asked for help to wheel me to the car so i could go to another hospital for better care and the nurse again was rude and said no
I'll need to walk out on my own .
I didn't have to sign anything
to leave cause after all that time and all those hours of just sitting there i never once saw a doctor , the nurse was cold hearted and uncaring and extremely rude and told us they would not help me to the car

valley doctor informed me I had a fracture of the ankle and torn ligaments .the nurses at valley were kind and caring and I was discharged with pain meds , a orthopedic referral and my ankle leg in a temporary cast
and given crutches .
the doctor explained things and had great bedside manner and stated that walking on it after this type of injury may have caused furthur damage not to mention the excruciating pain of sitting in hackensack for several hours , nothing to reduce swelling and with no consideration to my wellbeing or medical needs

Then when you see your regular Dr. you will hear something else they never told you. They do not want you to see your medical file at all. They LIE about the privacy policy because they do NOT want you to read it. They will tell you that the acknowledgement of Privacy practices they want signed IS the privacy policy which is a total LIE. I could go on & on. Even nasty cashers at times in the cafe.

170,review_39845,rocco chiusano,5,I have to say i was quite impressed with this hospital. I have been going to Valley for 22 years. I was not happy with Valley hospital in Paramus  after my last visit 2 weeks ago at there brand new hospital. I was laterally assaulted by a doctor in the emergency room after i just had abdominal surgy by an excellent doctor who dose perform all his surgeries at valley hospital. The doctor who addressed me was a delight. I asked her how long she was a doctor because i needed someone who was extremely seasoned in the art of medicine. Dr. Hephziba Yohannan is a true gem. She literally held my hand the entire time and reassured me that everything was going to be ok. She ordered a number of tests and found out what was wrong with me with out causing more harm to me. The only thing I wish Hackensack had was more rooms to put patients as i did have to wait by the nurses station the entire time. Who know maybe they wanted me there so that they could watch me at all time. I also have to say the nurse that helped me knew her stuff. she explained to me that the veins roll and it can be hard to get a good one. On her second try she captured one. My nurse was also very attentive and was always available when i needed her. I was very impressed with the staff from check in to check out. thank you so much. If defiantly recommend this hospital.

174,review_12024,Tatiana Rosario,1,I was born in Hackensack hospital & so were my kids. This WAS one of the best hospitals. However they are absolutely horrible. I went to the ER room because I had a very infected lump. I got there at 11am and left two days later with no answers. I was left in the hall way for an entire day and at one point the pain got so bad that I was almost screaming. They saw me and didnt do NOTHING! Im not a dramatic person especially in hospitals because I know how busy it can get and the pressure these doctors deal with must be intense. But wow this really gave me PTSD. On day one after making a laceration on the lump to see what came out they said a surgeon will come and see me. Two days passed and I kept asking and they kept just giving me strong pain meds and taking my vitals. The last day I was there a male nurse came into my room and was staring at me and he said “im sorry you are so beautiful” and made me feel super awkward because at this point I was in the observation room and I was kinda questioning if he was even a doctor. Then the next doctor came and did an MRI for NOTHING!!!! Still no answers. At the end that same doctor came back and said that a surgeon hasnt seen me because my case isnt priority. I was so disappointed in the time I had spent here for them to tell me my case isnt priority. I asked to be discharged immediately. It was a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE experience. Im so disappointed in the decline of this hospital. Really gave me PTSD. Never again will I come here. Its really sad. I rather go to palisades hospital mind you they are a much smaller.

183,review_50564,Sarilis Martinez,1,"Horrible experience at this hospital. I waited patiently for 18 hours while the doctors had no idea what to diagnose my daughter with. They mentioned it could possibly be appendicitis but didn’t seem too concerned, even though her appendix was enlarged and borderline concerning. As a parent, I needed answers and reassurance about my daughter’s health, but after all those hours, I left without either.

We didn’t complain despite not having food or drinks for hours. After being told my daughter could eat, the nurses promised to bring something but never did. It took hours just to get approval for a CT scan, and even after that, we waited by the CT room door for hours without being seen. The lack of communication and compassion was appalling.

To make matters worse, the nurses were changed repeatedly—far more than what shift rotations would normally require. I had no idea who was responsible for my daughter’s care, and when I asked, no one gave me a clear answer. Instead, they claimed they were “helping each other,” which clearly wasn’t the case. When I voiced my frustration about being left in a hallway with my daughter in pain, I was met with nasty attitudes, backlash, and no accountability.

I understand there are more severe cases, but at what point does my daughter’s pain and health become a priority? The lack of organization, professionalism, and basic patient care was evident. I’ve worked in the medical field for many years, and it’s heartbreaking to see how unorganized and dismissive this hospital has become. It felt more like a fast-food chain than a medical facility.

While I searched for help, I saw nurses laughing, chatting, and some on their phones, completely ignoring patients in need. Where is the patient care? Where is the compassion?

I am praying for my daughter’s health and that she recovers without complications. If anything happens to her, it will be due to the negligence of this hospital’s pediatric ER.

He then stated that he saw in the computer, they were ready and the doctor would come and speak to us ..(this point it is 10 pm) two hours later nobody came by yet again.

Visiting this emergency room (Morning Shift) was one of the WORST experiences I ever had in my life.

I further more told them who my employer was and that I need a letter stating I was there to pick them up. They denied my request and I asked to speak to a Manager in charger. The two ladies at the front desk gave two different names and when one of the ladies was about to call someone she knew could help me. The other lady with blonde hair told her no and to call someone else (I believe she was the desk supervisor in charge). Michelle D (The person in charge) approach me and said “What’s the Problem”. I explained the situation and told her how I had to leave work to come pick up my partner and if she need proof I can call I just need a letter stating I was present and she stated she’s not putting my name on a letter to use the patient discharge papers. I told her my job won’t accept that because it doesn’t have my name on it. I asked her why and stated I wasn’t violating any hippa laws, rules or regulations, or any work Laws she then told me she’s not putting my name on a letter and then proceeded to call security, Michelle D. Was very aggressive and dismissing. She told security she wasn’t providing any information and that they can escort me out. (MICHELLE D.

Furthermore As I read the discharge papers, my partner informed them of multiple body parts that hurt and from the looks of it they only inspected one part of their body nothing else.
This is completely unacceptable and i am very disappointed and the service this hospital provided us.

To me it seems as though they do what they want to do with the patients that’s being rushed to the emergency room and when family members come they don’t accommodate work information.

203,review_99173,Ana Fuentes,1,"I arrived to the emergency room yesterday, January 4th at approximately 4:00 pm.. the emergency room was super packed when I came in with severe abdominal pain. They took my vitals right away and asked me to go sit and wait.. I was crying from severe pain and they took me into the ER after about 20 minutes.. inside the ER there were beds all over the hallways and I was placed in section D on a bed in the hallway myself. I was evaluated by a doctor and they sent me for a CAT Scan, blood work and urine test.. they were very busy so this didn’t happen right away.. the nurse assigned to me came and put a port in my left arm by the bend of the elbow and from there she withdrew the blood and they game me Tylenol for the pain.. that didn’t help at all.. my husband had to wheel me around in a wheelchair to go to the restroom which was in a different section from where I was, because the pain is much more severe when I get up and I can’t walk. Every time a room became available it was given to someone else. After a few hours in the ER they finally took me to get my CAT scan. After the shift change a new doctor came and he prescribed Morphine for the pain and that helped me immediately..night fall came and patients came and left. Some were discharged and others were placed in a room but not me.. I spent the entire night between patients screaming, machines beeping, people talking and all kinds of noises, my pain, my anxiety and frustration.. a group of surgeons came to see me and they told me they couldn’t see anything wrong with me in the CAT scan but that they would continue to look and see what could be causing such excruciating pain. Early in the morning the nurse came and told me I was going to be transported to the “holding section A” to be monitored. Someone from that section came to tell me that they were going transferred me to the “holding section to be monitored. After a couple of hours I was finally transported to section A where I have been in a bed in the hallway ever since. It’s been over 24 hours since I came to the emergency room.. I still feel exactly as I did when I came in except when I get the pain meds the pain is minimal as long as I don’t stand up to go to the bathroom., many rooms have become available but they tell me they are not for me. They leave them available in case a patient sicker than me comes in.. as a matter of fact I am the only one left in the hallway because my illness is not considered “severe or serious enough” to merit a room.. I have never felt so discriminated, hurt, frustrated and as a second class citizen on top of feeling extremely vulnerable, scared, frustrated and in so much pain… why don’t I leave and or request a transfer to another hospital?? Because I’m in so much pain I can’t handle moving and starting from scratch in another hospital where I don’t know how I’m going to be treated. But rest assured I will call my insurance company and I will make sure they know not to pay for a room I never got and I will never come back to this hospital if I can help it!!!!

I was sent by my doctor a few months ago with high blood pressure- which in the eyes of many is cause to be immediately registered and at minimum connected to machines to ensure your ok; but no - after waiting hours - they connected me to an IV - handed my the IV bag - and told me to go back to the waiting room - I had to ask for a covid test after they didn’t initiate the procedure themselves and having high risk family members it’s something that is important to me - they asked for a urine  sample and after navigating to the bathroom with patients sitting along the entire hallways - I was into a bathroom that was a risk within itself - I don’t blame whoever decided to take their own IV out in the bathroom - because the lack of care and simple human softness causes desperation….but the wall and light switch  was splattered  with blood and blood all over the floor…….. after that I’ve decided to not go back there……. Unfortunately my mother was sent there a few months later - (not knowing better) her doctor was going to call the ambulance due to pre-stroke symptoms …….. she was left in the waiting  room because according to the very insensitive cold blooded registration nurse who said to me “she’s sitting there because she isn’t having a stroke right now” …….. after seeing her cold blooded response and body language which was completely unprofessional I asked her “if this was your mom what would you do” she continued to make it worse by saying “she isn’t having one”……. Yet 2 ekgs were done at her general doctor that were shown to them showing irregularities……… a simple “I understand “  would’ve made things much better ———- but looking at her so insensitivity managing our families situation I couldn’t even look at her …….. blonde -glasses - registration nurse in Emergency room triage 12/27 -5pm ———— I hope you never feel so helpless and I hope no loved one of yours or even you get treated this way. I hope God touches you and softens that marbled heart. I understand it’s the holidays and everyone is sick -and you might have worked 50 hours the last two days but - you signed up for this !! Not me !! but bed side manner and compassion should be the first thing you serve. Unless I am completely unconscious and am driven there involuntarily I pray to never have to be in the hospital or any of my loved one’s again …… we will deter and choose to drive out further for some human compassion - a sense of urgency ; and look for a hospital and people that will be more compassionate when your having a love threatening episode. My mother did not go in there with Viral symptoms or Covid symptoms - she was there with stroke symptoms and ekgs from her general doctor that was going to call the ambulance for her. So nurse - to you —- “do better” and to the Hackensack University Medical Center - credentials shouldn’t be the only thing you hire by -bed side manner, compassion and empathy should be included.

I can’t stress this enough: avoid this hospital if you value your sanity! They treat patients like they’re an afterthought, cramming them into hallways on stretchers—something you wouldn’t even see in the worst third-world facilities.

The staff is shockingly incompetent and utterly disorganized. They reserved a room for my mother, only to forget about it and hand it off to someone else. When we arrived for her gland stone issue, it took an excruciating **three hours** for them to administer pain relief. The suffering she endured was unbearable.

After spending **six long hours** in the ER hallway, she was finally moved to an observation area—guess what? Another hallway! The only change was being transferred from a stretcher to a so-called hospital bed. It feels like a scheme to inflate charges to insurance companies.

While the facility itself is clean and well-maintained, my concerns primarily revolve around the quality of care my mother received during her stay. Unfortunately, we felt that the staff was not as attentive or compassionate as we had hoped. There were instances where communication was lacking, and it took longer than expected to address our questions and concerns.

On a positive note, some nurses did show genuine care and went above and beyond to assist us. However, this inconsistency made the overall experience quite stressful during an already challenging time.

I hope that the management takes steps to improve staff training and communication, as I believe that with some adjustments, Hackensack medical Center could provide a much better experience for patients and their families.

Thank you for considering my feedback.

My father was taken by ambulance to John Hopkins Bayview despite us asking for him to be transported to Orleans street for care. At the Orleans street hospital the nurses and doctors were constantly in the room explaining what was going on with my father’s care. My father is bedridden and needs to be cleaned regularly and repositioned regularly. He was always clean and never once got a sore or even any redness after his two week stay. The hospital allows for a family member to stay the night with the patient and even has a family room with a refrigerator, ice machine and vending. The nurses are so friendly and always willing to help. Fast forward to his stay at Bayview. The complete opposite. He sat 32 hours in the ER waiting to get a bed to be admitted. He has a terrible pressure wound and another wound on his inside thigh from them putting an adult diaper on too tight. The nurses are rude. Every morning this week he has been soiled through the pads, all the bed sheets and covers and his gown. I asked to speak to the charge nurse, she never came. His room is full of medical trash laying on the floor. No where for a family member to sleep. My father has called us in the middle of the night to tell us he is soaked and he’s been pushing the call button for an hour and no one is coming. We have called and no one answered or they answer and say they will have the nurse call and then never return the call. I can go on and on.

41,review_32656,T C,1,"Years ago I saw a doctor at John Hopkins.  He was rude and arrogant, but he also didn't get the diagnosis correct. This happens and he was a sample of 1.  Doctor's are human - medicine isn't perfect, and so I didn't hold it against the hospital.  About 4-5 years ago, I went to a different department.  Over the doctor's objection, the scheduler's sent me to Bayview, which cost significantly more and delayed the procedure.  They did not inform me of the extra time or cost.  My doctor even asked why I went to Bayview when she saw me.

When I challenged the extra cost and explained that my doctor wanted me to go to Howard county, which would have been cheaper and faster, they refused to take the ""facility fee"" off my bill.  I had an attorney argue the case for me and finally the bill appeared to be settled to my satisfaction.  Four years later (today), they sent me to collections.  Even now, if I go to JHU's billing, I don't see the offending fee and my bill looks zero'd out as it has for the last four years.  I don't know if they are incompetent or malicious.

For me the critical thing is that they delayed my care over my doctor's order and then attempted to charge me more for their role in the delay in providing me treatment.  The fact that they appear to have sent me to collections 4 years later for a zero balance bill is just the icing on the cake.

Edit: I have called this number three times.  I end up in a voicemail box that is not set up.  I've called what I thought was the main patient relations number and they informed me that there is no way to talk to patient relations for the entire John Hopkins network unless you go through the individual Bayview patient relations first.  So, because Bayview patient relations doesn't have a voicemail box, you can't get to anyone higher up that has any authority to fix these issues.

The therapy worked well so we decided to come back this year.  Tomorrow is our last day of therapy.  We have been living in a hotel for the last three weeks.  Although it is very difficult to be away from home, our two visits to Johns Hopkins have been amazing!  First, I would like to recognize the ladies at the front desk when you check in.  They are always helpful and cheerful.  Millie, who does all the NIBS scheduling, is always there to help.  Next is Dr. Chao and Dr. Krasna.  They really care about my wife's condition and are always trying to help.  Last is the therapy staff.  They are amazing!! Daniel, Aara, Meredith, Nicole, Kristian, Erin, Leyna, Jacqueline, Megan, Elena and all the others who work in PM&R.  They are top notch!

Laziness.Nurses found it impossible to get medications on time or within a reasonable time. Not listening to my concerns. I was moved to 3 different rooms within the same unit. 2 rooms I did not have a bedside phone making food orders difficult as well as outside calls. One room was cockroach infested putting myself and my personal properties at risk. As well as the nurses refusing to enter my room due to fear of insects. Causing me to miss doses of medication all together or receiving medication as much as 1.5 hours late. I strongly recommend calling for medication early in attempt to receive it anywhere close to on time. Ask the cafe to read back your meal orders to have a better chance of accurately receiving what you ordered. I also strongly suggest taking notes including staff members names, detailed descriptions of interactions, and times and dates. I would not waste your time talking to senior patient experience representatives as they are rude and seem unbothered about patient concerns. While I was hospitalized I witnessed 3 separate patients leave against doctor's orders due to the disrespect and treatment from hospital staff. If possible do not come to john hopkins.

I very much understand triaging and that long waits are typical, but 28 hours is excessive to the extreme.  She was intially seen and they ran tests over 18 hours ago, but she's been waiting for a doctor to see her/review the results and either admit or discharge her ever since. In the meantime of those 18hrs, she was sent back to a waiting area. Just a short bit ago a nurse came out and said they'd forgotten entirely about my loved one and other patients and that they'd been about to clear them off the board!

Today, after speaking with a Concierge leader, I was informed that all the labs, patient charts, and medical records I submitted need to be translated into English. Why was this not communicated from the beginning? This critical information should have been made clear at the start of the process, not after months of back-and-forth.

To make matters worse, I was told that even if I provide the translated documents, it will take another 10 days to review them, followed by a six-month wait for an appointment. This is absolutely unacceptable, especially considering that my son is in pain and urgently needs medical attention.

What part of “my son is in pain” is not understood? At no point has there been any consideration for the patient’s suffering or urgency of care.

This experience has left me deeply disheartened and questioning the commitment of your institution to patient care.

72,review_6825,Dustin Reed,1,"I went to the Mayo Clinic back in may of 2024, and was diagnosed with a syrinx on my spinal cord. I was convinced that I needed a so-called fairly minor surgery to prevent further nerve damage in my legs. About a week after this surgery, my legs went numb and walking has become very challenging ever since. This has left me with a non-functional life, and I sit at home now because it is no longer safe for me to be out and about. I understand that things go wrong during surgery, and that's not even the part that bothers me. After the nerve issues started in my legs, the only answer they could come up with was MRI after MRI that provided zero answers and cost me about an extra $20,000. Why is it my responsibility to figure out what went wrong? It felt like they preyed on my misfortune to make some more money. The fact that I was pretty much paralyzed on their operating table was just a non-factor in this story.

Here are a few other things I experienced, that I feel Mayo Clinic and future patients should hear:

I use a catheter to urinate, and after surgery I was in so much pain that I could not do it myself. So, I asked for help and was told that their ""cath team"" had to help me with that. It took the cath team over an hour to come help, and by that time I had urinated all over myself and the bed, so I had to deal with them changing everything while I was in severe pain.

There was so much turnover, that I rarely even knew who my nurse was. This led to my pain medication routine being changed over and over again, which meant falling behind on the pain management and having to deal with a lot more pain than I should have.

Two different times I ordered food that never came.

After all of this, they made it very clear that all they cared about was the bill and I was made to feel like nothing but a $$$. When, if you ask me, they should have been calling me up advocating for me and how they were going to make this right, rather than hounding me for the bill and threatening to sue me.
