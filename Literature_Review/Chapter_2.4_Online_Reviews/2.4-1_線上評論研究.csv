Potential Dietary Supplement-drug Interactions: Fat-soluble Vitamins,"Mahmood, Batool I.; Alassaf, Fawaz A.; COLEGIO FARMACEUTICOS PROVINCIA DE BUENOS AIRES; Mahmood, Batool I.; Alassaf, Fawaz A.; Alassaf, Fawaz A.; Alassaf, Fawaz A.; Alassaf, Fawaz A.; Alassaf, Fawaz",2023,LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACY,N/A,WOS:001155943900001,Iraq,"Dietary supplement marketing and use have exploded in popularity over the last two decades. Dietary supplements can interact with prescription and over-the-counter drugs in various ways. Some supplements can interfere with the way a drug is absorbed or metabolized, or they can increase or decrease the effectiveness of a drug. Some drugs can affect the metabolism of supplements, making them more or less potent. The existing clinical data concerning dietary supplement adverse events and drug interactions can be ambiguous and often contradictory, which makes it difficult for healthcare providers to counsel patients about supplements. This review was designed based on data obtained from relevant online research articles using the phrases dietary supplements -drug interactions, and fat-soluble vitamins up to June 2022 on PubMed and Google Scholar. The goal of this review was to look at the known fat-soluble vitamin supplement -drug interactions. Such an overview would make it easier for healthcare providers to communicate these documented interactions and contraindications to their patients, preventing significant adverse events and improving therapeutic outcomes.",0,0,supplement-drug interactions; vitamin A; vitamin D; vitamin E; vitamin K; SAFETY; MULTIVITAMIN; EFFICACY; ADULTS,Article

The aim of our study is to perform a systematic review of the current literature on Nexobrid & REG; outcomes. We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and other search engines (2013-2023). The online screening process was performed by two independent reviewers with the Covidence tool. The protocol was reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses, and it was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews of the National Institute for Health Research. We identified 103 relevant studies of which 34 were found eligible. The included studies report the positive effects of Nexobrid & REG; on burn debridement, functional and cosmetic outcomes, scarring, and quality of life. Also, they validate the high patient satisfaction thanks to enhanced protocols of analgosedation and/or locoregional anaesthesia during Bromelain-based debridement. Two studies investigate potential risks (coagulopathy, burn wound infection) which concluded there is no strong evidence of these adverse events. NexoBrid & REG; is a safe, selective, non-surgical eschar removal treatment modality. The benefits of Bromelain-based debridement are faster debridement and healing times, reduced operations, length of stay, cases of sepsis, blood transfusions, and prevention of compartment syndrome.

Objective To evaluate knowledge and awareness about potential barriers to medication adherence, and to evaluate strategies used in clinical practice by Portuguese clinicians on how to foster medication adherence of patients undergoing secondary cardiovascular prevention. Setting Nominal Group Technique (NGT) at the University of Lisbon; online survey addressed to physicians working in primary and secondary care in Portugal. Method A narrative literature review was conducted in Pubmed to identify studies describing interventions targeted at physicians to manage medication adherence. The NGT included 12 allied healthcare professionals with recognized expertise in medication adherence and was organised in four phases, resulting in survey development. The survey was used in a cross-sectional national study where clinicians reported their knowledge and perceptions about patients' medication adherence and their daily practice. Main outcome measures Knowledge and awareness about barriers to medication adherence; and practice patterns. Results A total of 296 papers were identified, 26 of which were included. Four main topics were selected to be used in the NGT: adherence determinants, detecting non-adherence, fostering adherence, and educating physicians. NGT resulted in a survey, reaching 451 physicians, mostly practicing in primary care. Most had specific education on medication adherence and considered patient interviews and prescription records the most useful assessment methods. Nonetheless, many recognised often using clinical judgement to evaluate adherence in practice. Barriers to medication adherence were perceived to occur often during implementation. Most perceived reasons for uncontrolled hypertension were non-adherence to lifestyle recommendations and to medication. Less than half the physicians asked their patients if medication was taken. More useful enabling strategies included reducing daily doses, reviewing therapeutic options and motivational interventions. Conclusions Clinicians seem well informed about the importance of medication adherence and aware of problems encountered in practice. Limited time during medical appointment may be a barrier for better patient support.",0,0,Cardiovascular secondary prevention; Medical education; Medical practice; Medication adherence; Portugal; PRIMARY-CARE; COMMUNICATION; INTERVENTIONS; NONADHERENCE; METAANALYSIS; DISEASE,Article

Objectives Patient Understanding Leading to Assessment for a Severe Asthma Referral (PULSAR) is a novel, multidisciplinary working group aiming to develop and disseminate a global, patient-centered description of severe asthma to improve patient understanding of severe asthma and effect a change in patient behavior whereby patients are encouraged to visit their healthcare professional, when appropriate. Methods Current definitions from patient organization websites, asthma guidelines, and medication information for key asthma drugs were assessed and informed a multidisciplinary working group, convened to identify common concepts and terminology used to define severe asthma. A patient-centered description of severe asthma and patient checklist were drafted based on working-group discussions and reviewed by an external behavioral scientist for patient understanding and relevance. These were tested using an online US/Canadian survey. Results The patient-centered description of severe asthma and patient checklist were reviewed and re-drafted by the authors. The text was simplified following the behavioral-scientist review. The survey (n = 153) included 105 patients with severe asthma. Of those with severe asthma, 92.2% of patients reported that the description was consistent with their experiences of severe asthma and 92.6% of patients reported that the PULSAR initiative would encourage them to visit their healthcare provider. Conclusion A patient-centered description of severe asthma has been developed and tested using patients with severe asthma; this description will allow patients to assess whether they might have severe asthma and prompt them to visit their healthcare provider, if appropriate.",0,0,DEFINITION; GUIDELINES,Article

The South-Asian (SA) countries have witnessed both the initial brunt of the outbreak as well as the ongoing rise of cases. Their unique challenges in relation to mental health during the pandemic are worth exploring. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted for all the original studies on the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on psychological health/well-being in the SA countries of the World Psychiatric Association Zone 16. PubMed, Google Scholar, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, and SCOPUS were searched till June 2020. Studies conducted in the age group of 18-60 years with a minimum sample size of 10, and statistically significant results were included. Results: Thirteen studies were included in the review. They showed increase prevalence in nonpsychotic depression, anxiety, somatic concerns, alcohol-related disorders, and insomnia in the general population. Psychological symptoms correlated more with physical complaints of fatigue and pain in older adults and were directly related to social media use, misinformation, xenophobia, and social distancing. Frontline workers reported guilt, stigma, anxiety, and poor sleep quality, which were related to the lack of availability of adequate personal protective equipment, increased workload, and discrimination. One study validated the Coronavirus anxiety scale in the Indian population while another explored gaming as a double-edged sword during the lockdown in adolescents. Another study from Bangladesh explored psychosexual health during lockdown. Most studies were cross-sectional online surveys, used screening tools and had limited accessibility. Conclusion: The ongoing COVID-19 crisis and its impact serve as an important period for adequate mental healthcare, promotion, research, and holistic biopsychosocial management of psychiatric disorders, especially in vulnerable groups.

Storytelling methods can privilege Indigenous voices in research. Indigenous people's knowledge systems have existed for millennium, where knowledge is produced and shared through stories. Our collaborative team of Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, and Indigenous Elders, patients, healthcare providers, and administrators, conducted a participatory, scoping review to examine how storytelling has been used as a method in Indigenous health research on Turtle Island (North America), Australia, and Aotearoa (New Zealand). We searched key databases and online sources for qualitative and mixed-methods studies that involved Indigenous participants and used storytelling as a method in health research. Reviewers screened abstracts/full texts to confirm eligibility. Narrative data were extracted and synthesized. An intensive collaboration was woven throughout and included gatherings incorporating Indigenous protocol, Elders' teachings on storytelling, and sharing circles. We included 178 articles and found a diverse array of storytelling approaches and adaptations, along with exemplary practices and problematic omissions. Researchers honoured Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing through careful preparation and community engagement to do storywork, inclusion of Indigenous languages and protocols, and Indigenous initiation and governance. Storytelling centered Indigenous voices, was a culturally relevant and respectful method, involved a healing process, and reclaimed Indigenous stories. But it could result in several challenges when researchers did not meaningfully engage with Indigenous peoples.

Acute type 2 respiratory failure is also called acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) and characterised by an elevated arterial CO2 level of >6 kPa due to pump failure. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the most common cause of AHRF. High-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) is a new oxygen delivery system that uses an oxygen-air blender to deliver flow rates of up to 60 L/min. The gas is delivered humidified and heated to the patient via wide-bore nasal cannula. Methods and analysis We hypothesised that HFNC as the initial oxygen administration method will reduce the number of patients with AHRF requiring non-invasive ventilation in patients at 6 hours post intervention when compared with low-flow nasal oxygen (LFO). A randomised single-centre unblinded controlled trial is designed to test our hypothesis. The trial will compare two oxygen administration methods, HFNT versus LFO.

We also examine the moderate role of review length on the relationship between patient satisfaction and review helpfulness. The second purpose is to explore the influences of the review topics on review helpfulness. Our study reveals four essential findings. First, not all emotions significantly influence review helpfulness, and only low-arousal emotions have a significant positive influence on review helpfulness. Second, an inverted U-shaped relationship between review length and review helpfulness and a U-shaped relationship between patient satisfaction and review helpfulness are confirmed. Third, review length has a moderate influence on the inverted U-shaped relationship between patient satisfaction and review helpfulness. Finally, the review topics related to blood sugar, family medical history, dosing time and injection significantly influence review helpfulness. These findings may serve as a stepping stone for future research on review helpfulness in the healthcare context, offering guidance for patients with diabetes, design implications for platform providers, and drug improvement suggestions for pharmaceutical companies.",0,0,Online drug treatment review; Dual-process theory; Review helpfulness; Design science approach; PERCEIVED HELPFULNESS; CONSUMER REVIEWS; INFORMATION LOAD; SOCIAL-INFLUENCE; COMMUNITIES; QUALITY; SALES; MODEL; PRICE,Review

However, the condition's lifelong, far reaching, and multifaceted impacts highlight the importance to gain the perspectives from those with PCOS. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to explore the current literatures and gaps around the experiences and perceptions of those living with PCOS Method: A comprehensive search of seven electronic databases was conducted between July and October 2021. A total 34 from 1615 screened articles were included in this systematic review and subsequently coded using NVivo 12 software. The quality of individual studies was assessed by adaptation to the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) quality assessment tool. Results: Five domains were generated from the data: Signs/Symptoms, Diagnosis, Management, Perceptions, Resources and Improving Outcomes. Dissatisfaction surrounding the experience of diagnosis was common. Concerns surrounded perceived lack of knowledge from healthcare professionals and delays in diagnosis. Individual studies on adults and adolescents shared similar feelings. The consensus was found to be that current management was vague and generalised. Symptoms such as hirsutism, obesity, irregular menstruation challenge personal and societal expectations of femininity. Online PCOS resources are popular amongst those with PCOS but most of them lack evidence. A call for more culturally specific resources was found to be common ground amongst those with PCOS. Conclusion: Overall dissatisfaction amongst adults and adolescents regarding their diagnostic journey of PCOS.

This review sought to identify and classify outcomes of guidelines from HTA organizations within published research. Methodology: We performed a systematic mixed studies review of empirical studies that (a) referred to a published guideline from an HTA organization and (b) reported an outcome resulting from a guideline. We searched the published literature in English or French within seven databases. Outcome types were classified within five dimensions of an existing framework for online health information (e.g., relevance, cognitive/affective impact, and use). Subdimensions were inductively developed. A two-phase sequential data synthesis was performed. Phase 1: a hybrid deductive- inductive thematic analysis identified the types of outcomes and displayed their relationships on a concept map. Phase 2: descriptive statistics were tabulated by the type of outcome. Results: A total of 6,719 records were retrieved through searches on 6 February 2023. After screening, we included 120 observational studies (twenty-one qualitative, ninety-four quantitative, and five mixed methods). Phase 1 identified twenty-nine types of outcomes. The most frequently reported outcomes were within the organizational dimension (reported in ninetyfour studies). The most common subdimensions were "" Referrals "" (thirty-eight occurrences), the "" Quality of Prescriptions"" (fifteen occurrences), and the "" Quality of Diagnosis"" (eight occurrences). For Phase 2, we could only generate descriptive statistics on seventeen outcomes. These were almost equally distributed among positive, neutral, and negative effects.

This scoping review was conducted to summarize how VBHC had been represented in theory and in practice, how it had been applied to assess hospital performance, and how well it had been ultimately implemented. MethodsFor this review, we followed the PRISMA-ScR protocol and searched five major online databases for articles published between January 2006 and July 2022. We included original articles that used the concept of VBHC to conduct performance assessments of healthcare organizations. We extracted and analyzed key concepts and information on the dimensions of VBHC, specific strategies and methods for using VBHC in performance assessment, and the effectiveness of the assessment. ResultsWe identified 48 eligible studies from 7866 articles. Nineteen nonempirical studies focused on the development of a VBHC performance assessment indicator system, and 29 empirical studies reported on the ways and points of introducing VBHC into performance assessment and its effectiveness. Ultimately, we summarized the key dimensions, processes, and effects of performance assessment after introducing VBHC. ConclusionCurrent healthcare performance assessment has begun to focus on implementing VBHC as an integrated strategy, and future work should further clarify the reliability of metrics and their association with evaluation outcomes and consider the effective integration of clinical outcomes and patient-reported outcomes.",0,0,hospital; performance assessment; the scoping review; value-based healthcare; DECISION-MAKING; CLINICAL-PERFORMANCE; PATIENT EXPERIENCE; QUALITY; FRAMEWORK; REDUCTION; OUTCOMES; CONDUCT; EUROPE; FAMILY,Review

Little information is known regarding the risks and outcomes of cosmetic tourism, in particular, for aesthetic breast surgery. The majority of the literature involves retrospective case series with no defined comparator. We aimed to amalgamate the published data to date to ascertain the risks involved and the outcomes of cosmetic tourism for aesthetic breast surgery on a global basis. Methods A systematic review of PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and OVID Medline was conducted using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. Keywords such as ""medical tourism"", ""cosmetic tourism"", ""tourism"", ""tourist"", ""surgery"", ""breast"" and ""outcomes"" were used. Seven hundred and seventy-one titles were screened, and 86 abstracts were reviewed leaving 35 full texts. Twenty-four of these met the inclusion criteria and were used to extract data for this systematic review. Results One hundred and seventy-one patients partook in cosmetic tourism for aesthetic breast surgery. Forty-nine percent of patients had an implant-based procedure. Other procedures included: mastopexy (n=4), bilateral breast reduction (n=11) and silicone injections (n=2). Two-hundred and twenty-two complications were recorded, common complications included: wound infection in 39% (n=67), breast abscess/ collection in 12% (n=21), wound dehiscence in 12% (n= 20) and ruptured implant in 8% (n=13). Clavien-Dindo classification of the complications includes 88 (51%) IIIb complications with 103 returns to theatre, 2 class IV complications (ICU stay) and one class V death of a patient. Explantation occurred in 39% (n=32) of implant-based augmentation patients. Conclusions Aesthetic breast surgery tourism is popular within the cosmetic tourism industry. However, with infective complications (39%) and return to theatre rates (51%) significantly higher than expected, it is clear that having these procedures abroad significantly increases the risks involved. The high complication rate not only impacts individual patients, but also the home country healthcare systems. Professional bodies for cosmetic surgery in each country must highlight and educate patients how to lower this risk if they do choose to have cosmetic surgery abroad. In this current era of an intra-pandemic world where health care is already stretched, the burden from cosmetic tourism complications must be minimised.",0,0,Medical tourism; Breast surgery; Aesthetic surgery; COSMETIC TOURISM; COST-ANALYSIS; COMPLICATIONS; INFECTIONS; MANAGEMENT,Review

Despite its potential benefits, its application in the context of TKA in Iran is in its early stages, lacking comprehensive studies on feasibility, acceptance and programme adherence. This article outlines a protocol for an open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial investigating the impact of a 4 week telerehabilitation programme alongside usual care. Methods Thirty patients (aged 50-90) undergoing TKA for severe Knee Osteoarthritis at Atiyeh Hospital in Tehran, Iran, will be recruited using block randomisation. Participants will be assigned to either the intervention group, receiving telerehabilitation or the control group without telerehabilitation. The intervention will include virtual physiotherapy sessions thrice weekly, lasting 30-45 min each, over 4 weeks. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of telerehabilitation, measured through recruitment and attrition rates, questionnaire completion rates, patient satisfaction using appropriate questionnaire and adherence to the intervention. Secondary outcomes encompass four Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaire subscales (function in Activities of Daily Living, Pain, Symptoms, Quality of Life). Patient global assessment will use a standardised question. An online survey will evaluate walking assistant device usage, exercise adherence and adverse events. The number of individuals receiving in-person rehabilitation will be documented after the first postoperative surgeon visit. Assessments occur at baseline and 4 weeks postsurgery. Analysis Statistical analysis, including independent samples t-test, paired samples t-test, chi 2 test, Fisher's exact test, analysis of covariance and multiple linear regression, will use SPSS software version 16, with significance set at p<0.05.

They were set up largely as a response to the Covid-19 pandemic, and are therefore different in style and content, with some wobble rooms containing basics, whilst others host therapy animals and creative activities. Some wobble spaces were also established online. Evaluations of existing wobble spaces show that accessing a dedicated space, activities and sharing with others have positive effects on staff well-being. Despite this, the wobble space model does not appear to have been extended from health care into social work. This article describes a small pilot research study, delivered over three months, at fortnightly intervals, with social workers from the same UK authority. The study drew inspiration from the 'Weeble' a 1970's toy which could 'wobble but not fall down' and offered participants a safe place to meet, share and experiment with creative activities.
