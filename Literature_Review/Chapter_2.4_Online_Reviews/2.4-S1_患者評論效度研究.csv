Psychometric properties of the Braden scale to assess pressure injury risk in intensive care: A systematic review,"Mehicic, Aldiana; Burston, Adam; Fulbrook, Paul; ELSEVIER SCI LTD; Mehicic, Aldiana; Burston, Adam; Fulbrook, Paul; Mehicic, Aldiana; Burston, Adam; Fulbrook, Paul; Fulbrook, Paul; Burston, Adam; Burston, Adam; Fulbrook, Paul; Burston, Adam; Burston, Adam",2024,INTENSIVE AND CRITICAL CARE NURSING,10.1016/j.iccn.2024.103686,WOS:001216442700001,Australia; South Africa,"Objective: To analyse the psychometric properties of the Braden scale to assess pressure injury risk in adults in intensive care. Design: A systematic review was conducted, with literature searches undertaken in five electronic databases. No date limits were applied. Selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were completed by two reviewers independently. A customised data extraction template was used, with risk of bias conducted using the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist. Data were analysed using narrative synthesis. Results: Thirty-four studies met inclusion criteria. Two studies reported internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha ranging from poor (0.43) to good (0.85). For interrater reliability, only four studies reported intraclass correlation, ranging from 0.66 to 0.96 for Braden sum score. Three studies reported convergent validity, with strong associations found between the COMHON Index (r = 0.70), Cubbin-Jackson scale (r = 0.80), and Norton scale (r = 0.77), but contrasting associations with the Waterlow score (r = 0.22 to 0.72). A large majority of studies reported predictive validity (n = 29), with wide variability. Several studies investigated optimal cut-off scores, with the majority indicating this was in the range of 12-14. Conclusions: This review demonstrates inconsistency in the psychometric properties of the Braden scale in ICU settings. Further research is needed to determine suitability of the Braden scale for ICU before it can be recommended as standard for clinical practice, including comparison with other ICU-specific risk assessment tools. Implications for clinical practice: When used in ICU, the reliability, validity and reported cut-off scores of the Braden scale are variable. As a predictive tool, the scale should be used cautiously. In ICU, the value of the Braden scale resides in its ability to identify patients that are most at risk of developing a pressure injury and to implement preventative measures to mitigate identified risk factors.",0,0,Braden scale; Intensive care; Pressure injury; Risk assessment; Systematic review; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; PREDICTIVE-VALIDITY; ULCER RISK; INTERRATER RELIABILITY; AGREEMENT; ACCURACY; WATERLOW; JACKSON; TRAUMA; SCORES,Review

Carrier screening has historically been offered for certain conditions in high-risk populations. However, more recent evidence has shown that offering carrier screening to all patients, regardless of their ethnicity, more effectively and equitably identifies at-risk couples. Coupled with technology that enables screening for a nearly unlimited number of conditions, this expanded carrier screening (ECS) approach is now supported by professional society guidelines. Despite recent recommendations by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics to screen all patients who are pregnant or considering pregnancy for 113 conditions, questions remain about what conditions should be included on a core ECS panel. Here, we briefly review the history of carrier screening and guidelines on criteria for panel design. We then suggest which of these criteria are most critical, as well as thresholds to identify which conditions meet these criteria. Based on these interpretations, we recommend a core panel of 64 conditions that would identify the vast majority of at-risk couples. Widespread adoption of a core panel such as this would result in a marked improvement in the number of patients currently receiving comprehensive carrier screening.",3,0,CLINICAL VALIDITY; MEDICAL-GENETICS; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; STATEMENT; STANDARDS; VARIANTS; GENOMICS,Review

There are practice guidelines that outline the requirements for the assessment and treatment of adults. Nevertheless, guidelines specifying what constitutes a good quality diagnostic assessment and report and the competencies required to be a specialist assessor are lacking. This can lead to variation in the quality and reliability of adult ADHD assessments. Poor quality assessments may not be accepted as valid indicators of the presence of ADHD by other clinicians or services, resulting in wasteful re-assessments and delays in providing treatment. To address this issue the UK Adult ADHD Network (UKAAN) proposes a quality framework for adult ADHD assessments - the Adult ADHD Assessment Quality Assurance Standard (AQAS). Methods: The co-authors agreed on five questions or themes that then guided the development of a set of consensus statements. An initial draft was reviewed and amended in an iterative process to reach a final consensus. Results: What constitutes a high-quality diagnostic assessment and report was agreed by consensus of the co-authors. The resulting guideline emphasises the need to evaluate impairment, describes core competencies required by the assessor and highlights the importance of linking the diagnosis to an appropriate post-diagnostic discussion. Assessments should be completed in the context of a full psychiatric and neurodevelopmental review, and need good interview skills, using a semi-structured interview with open questioning and probing to elicit real life examples of symptoms and impairments. It is recommended that 2 hours or more is required for an adequate assessment including both the diagnostic assessment and initial post-assessment discussions. Conclusion: The AQAS has been developed as a practical resource to support reliable and valid diagnostic assessments of adult ADHD. It is intended to complement formal training. A secondary objective is to empower patients by providing them with evidence-based information on what to expect from an assessment and assessment report.",0,0,adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; adult ADHD; practice guidelines; diagnostic assessment; quality standard assessment; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; BRITISH-ASSOCIATION; COVID-19; RECOMMENDATIONS; ADOLESCENTS; MANAGEMENT,Review

Quality improvement studies are needed to assess the representativeness of PRO data collected in routine care, identify the underlying causes of non-response and develop novel methods to ensure data representativeness. Using a multilevel framework and a mixed-methods approach, we have three aims: (1) characterise the non-response of the Global-10 across clinic, provider and patient levels; (2) identify multilevel causes of non-response and potential strategies to improve representativeness in PRO collection; and (3) develop effective modifications to missing-data methods to enhance the representativeness of pre-existing PRO data. Methods and analysis Our primary data source is the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global-10, collected as part of routine care at the Radiation Oncology clinics within the Mass General Brigham (MGB) healthcare system. Other sources include (1) Harvard Catalyst for provider-specific data, (2) MGB administrative data, (3) public Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data and (4) the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System. We will conduct quantitative analyses to assess variations in Global-10 non-response across multilevel factors. Additionally, we will use qualitative interviews with patients and clinical professionals to understand the causes of non-response and to formulate strategies to expand the reach of PRO collection to underrepresented cancer patients, improve their completions and enhance overall data representativeness. Finally, we will integrate implementation science knowledge and findings from the first two aims into missing-data methods to manage non-response in the pre-existing Global-10 data and to evaluate their performance in preserving representativeness. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (24-225). Written informed consent will be obtained from participants. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international conferences.",0,0,CLINICAL-TRIALS; CANCER; IMPUTATION,Article

We aimed to collate an individual patient-level data set from large, high-quality pre-ex-isting studies on pneumonia in children to identify a set of signs and symptoms with greater validity in the diagnosis, prognosis, and possible treatment of childhood pneumonia for the improvement of cur-rent pneumonia case management guidelines. Methods Using data from a published systematic review and expert knowledge, we identified stud-ies meeting our eligibility criteria and invited inves-tigators to share individual-level patient data. We collected data on demographic information, general medical history, and current illness episode, includ-ing history, clinical presentation, chest radiograph findings when available, treatment, and outcome. Data were gathered separately from hospital-based and community-based cases. We performed a narra-tive synthesis to describe the final data set. Results Forty-one separate data sets were includ-ed in the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations (PREPARE) database, 26 of which were hospital-based and 15 were commu-nity-based. The PREPARE database includes 285 839 children with pneumonia (244 323 in the hospital and 41 516 in the community), with detailed de-scriptions of clinical presentation, clinical progres-sion, and outcome. Of 9185 pneumonia-related deaths, 6836 (74%) occurred in children <1 year of age and 1317 (14%) in children aged 1-2 years. Of the 285 839 episodes, 280 998 occurred in chil-dren 0-59 months old, of which 129 584 (46%) were 2-11 months of age and 152 730 (54%) were males. Conclusions This data set could identify an improved specific, sensitive set of criteria for diagnosing clin-ical pneumonia and help identify sick children in need of referral to a higher level of care or a change of therapy. Field studies could be designed based on insights from PREPARE analyses to validate a potential revised pneumonia algorithm. The PREPARE methodology can also act as a model for disease database assembly.",0,0,CLINICAL-FEATURES; YOUNG-CHILDREN; INFECTIONS; DIARRHEA; OVERLAP; MALARIA; BURDEN,Article

A review of combined functional neuroimaging and motion capture for motor rehabilitation,"Lorenz, Emanuel A.; Su, Xiaomeng; Skjaeret-Maroni, Nina; BMC; Lorenz, Emanuel A.; Su, Xiaomeng; Skjaeret-Maroni, Nina; Lorenz, Emanuel A.; Maroni, Nina; Lorenz, Emanuel Alexander",2024,JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION,10.1186/s12984-023-01294-6,WOS:001136176200003,Norway,"BackgroundTechnological advancements in functional neuroimaging and motion capture have led to the development of novel methods that facilitate the diagnosis and rehabilitation of motor deficits. These advancements allow for the synchronous acquisition and analysis of complex signal streams of neurophysiological data (e.g., EEG, fNIRS) and behavioral data (e.g., motion capture). The fusion of those data streams has the potential to provide new insights into cortical mechanisms during movement, guide the development of rehabilitation practices, and become a tool for assessment and therapy in neurorehabilitation.Research objectiveThis paper aims to review the existing literature on the combined use of motion capture and functional neuroimaging in motor rehabilitation. The objective is to understand the diversity and maturity of technological solutions employed and explore the clinical advantages of this multimodal approach.MethodsThis paper reviews literature related to the combined use of functional neuroimaging and motion capture for motor rehabilitation following the PRISMA guidelines. Besides study and participant characteristics, technological aspects of the used systems, signal processing methods, and the nature of multimodal feature synchronization and fusion were extracted.ResultsOut of 908 publications, 19 were included in the final review. Basic or translation studies were mainly represented and based predominantly on healthy participants or stroke patients. EEG and mechanical motion capture technologies were most used for biomechanical data acquisition, and their subsequent processing is based mainly on traditional methods. The system synchronization techniques at large were underreported. The fusion of multimodal features mainly supported the identification of movement-related cortical activity, and statistical methods were occasionally employed to examine cortico-kinematic relationships.ConclusionThe fusion of motion capture and functional neuroimaging might offer advantages for motor rehabilitation in the future. Besides facilitating the assessment of cognitive processes in real-world settings, it could also improve rehabilitative devices' usability in clinical environments. Further, by better understanding cortico-peripheral coupling, new neuro-rehabilitation methods can be developed, such as personalized proprioceptive training. However, further research is needed to advance our knowledge of cortical-peripheral coupling, evaluate the validity and reliability of multimodal parameters, and enhance user-friendly technologies for clinical adaptation.",10,0,Multimodal; Neuroimaging; Motion capture; Motor function; Rehabilitation; Assessment; Review; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; OUTCOME MEASURES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG-ANALYSIS; STROKE; MOVEMENT; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ORGANIZATION; ATTENTION; TRACKING,Review
