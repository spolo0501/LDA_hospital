However, the condition's lifelong, far reaching, and multifaceted impacts highlight the importance to gain the perspectives from those with PCOS. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to explore the current literatures and gaps around the experiences and perceptions of those living with PCOS Method: A comprehensive search of seven electronic databases was conducted between July and October 2021. A total 34 from 1615 screened articles were included in this systematic review and subsequently coded using NVivo 12 software. The quality of individual studies was assessed by adaptation to the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) quality assessment tool. Results: Five domains were generated from the data: Signs/Symptoms, Diagnosis, Management, Perceptions, Resources and Improving Outcomes. Dissatisfaction surrounding the experience of diagnosis was common. Concerns surrounded perceived lack of knowledge from healthcare professionals and delays in diagnosis. Individual studies on adults and adolescents shared similar feelings. The consensus was found to be that current management was vague and generalised. Symptoms such as hirsutism, obesity, irregular menstruation challenge personal and societal expectations of femininity. Online PCOS resources are popular amongst those with PCOS but most of them lack evidence. A call for more culturally specific resources was found to be common ground amongst those with PCOS. Conclusion: Overall dissatisfaction amongst adults and adolescents regarding their diagnostic journey of PCOS. Tailored and culturally specific PCOS advice and management is necessary and can be achieved through co-creation of resources between healthcare professionals and those with PCOS.",20,0,polycystic ovary syndrome; PCOS; lived experience; expectations; perspectives; satisfaction; culturally appropriate resources; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BODY-MASS INDEX; WOMENS EXPERIENCES; SYNDROME PCOS; MANAGEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; ADOLESCENTS; INFORMATION; DEPRESSION; OVERWEIGHT,Article,2.4-1_線上評論研究.csv
Exploring social media usage in improving public perception on workplace violence against healthcare workers,"Lian, Ying; Dong, Xuefan; ELSEVIER SCI LTD; Lian, Ying; Dong, Xuefan; Dong, Xuefan; Dong, Xuefan",2021,TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY,10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101559,WOS:000661118100027,Peoples R China,"Workplace violence against healthcare workers has been a major social problem in many countries. A misunderstanding between patients and physicians is the primary cause of violence . The recent rise of social media offered a new communication channel between the government and the public. This study aims to explore and examine the use of social media to improve public perception about the medical workplace violence by considering a recently issued policy in China. We collected 12,250 posts before, during and after the implementation of the policy from Weibo, which is similar to Twitter. Sentiment classification and topic clustering methods were used to analyze the data. One-way ANOVA was applied to assess the changes of public sentiments over time. Results showed that the proportion of posts with negative sentiment statistically significantly decreased after the release of the policy, indicating the effectiveness of social media in improving public perception about the medical workplace violence, to a large extent. Topic clustering results regarding the policy showed that most people supported the policy. However, some believe that punishment measures contained in the policy need to be strengthened and that more attention should be paid to the hospitals and medical staffs, as well as how to effectively protect the interests of patients. Based on these findings, we suggested government to effectively and scientifically use social media to address medical workplace violence from the perspective of the public and further consider its causes in terms of both patients and medical staffs, and building an expert witness system seems to be helpful. Measures for guaranteeing the safety of medical staffs should be built by comprehensively evaluating the potential risk. These results can help governments increase the engagement of their citizens.",15,0,Workplace violence; Healthcare workers; Public perception; Social media; Data mining; LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION; TOPIC ANALYSIS; NURSES; DISPUTES; ENGAGEMENT; SENTIMENT; REVIEWS,Article,2.4-S3_情感分析醫療領域.csv
A review of combined functional neuroimaging and motion capture for motor rehabilitation,"Lorenz, Emanuel A.; Su, Xiaomeng; Skjaeret-Maroni, Nina; BMC; Lorenz, Emanuel A.; Su, Xiaomeng; Skjaeret-Maroni, Nina; Lorenz, Emanuel A.; Maroni, Nina; Lorenz, Emanuel Alexander",2024,JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION,10.1186/s12984-023-01294-6,WOS:001136176200003,Norway,"BackgroundTechnological advancements in functional neuroimaging and motion capture have led to the development of novel methods that facilitate the diagnosis and rehabilitation of motor deficits. These advancements allow for the synchronous acquisition and analysis of complex signal streams of neurophysiological data (e.g., EEG, fNIRS) and behavioral data (e.g., motion capture). The fusion of those data streams has the potential to provide new insights into cortical mechanisms during movement, guide the development of rehabilitation practices, and become a tool for assessment and therapy in neurorehabilitation.Research objectiveThis paper aims to review the existing literature on the combined use of motion capture and functional neuroimaging in motor rehabilitation. The objective is to understand the diversity and maturity of technological solutions employed and explore the clinical advantages of this multimodal approach.MethodsThis paper reviews literature related to the combined use of functional neuroimaging and motion capture for motor rehabilitation following the PRISMA guidelines. Besides study and participant characteristics, technological aspects of the used systems, signal processing methods, and the nature of multimodal feature synchronization and fusion were extracted.ResultsOut of 908 publications, 19 were included in the final review. Basic or translation studies were mainly represented and based predominantly on healthy participants or stroke patients. EEG and mechanical motion capture technologies were most used for biomechanical data acquisition, and their subsequent processing is based mainly on traditional methods. The system synchronization techniques at large were underreported. The fusion of multimodal features mainly supported the identification of movement-related cortical activity, and statistical methods were occasionally employed to examine cortico-kinematic relationships.ConclusionThe fusion of motion capture and functional neuroimaging might offer advantages for motor rehabilitation in the future. Besides facilitating the assessment of cognitive processes in real-world settings, it could also improve rehabilitative devices' usability in clinical environments. Further, by better understanding cortico-peripheral coupling, new neuro-rehabilitation methods can be developed, such as personalized proprioceptive training. However, further research is needed to advance our knowledge of cortical-peripheral coupling, evaluate the validity and reliability of multimodal parameters, and enhance user-friendly technologies for clinical adaptation.",10,0,Multimodal; Neuroimaging; Motion capture; Motor function; Rehabilitation; Assessment; Review; NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; OUTCOME MEASURES; BRAIN ACTIVITY; EEG-ANALYSIS; STROKE; MOVEMENT; MAGNETOENCEPHALOGRAPHY; ORGANIZATION; ATTENTION; TRACKING,Review,2.4-S1_患者評論效度研究.csv

Expanded carrier screening: What conditions should we screen for?,"Goldberg, James D.; Pierson, Summer; Johansen Taber, Katherine; WILEY; Goldberg, James D.; Pierson, Summer; Johansen Taber, Katherine; Goldberg, James D.; Johansen Taber, Katherine",2023,PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS,10.1002/pd.6306,WOS:000916587300001,USA,"Carrier screening tests reproductive couples for their risk of having children affected by serious monogenic conditions. Carrier screening has historically been offered for certain conditions in high-risk populations. However, more recent evidence has shown that offering carrier screening to all patients, regardless of their ethnicity, more effectively and equitably identifies at-risk couples. Coupled with technology that enables screening for a nearly unlimited number of conditions, this expanded carrier screening (ECS) approach is now supported by professional society guidelines. Despite recent recommendations by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics to screen all patients who are pregnant or considering pregnancy for 113 conditions, questions remain about what conditions should be included on a core ECS panel. Here, we briefly review the history of carrier screening and guidelines on criteria for panel design. We then suggest which of these criteria are most critical, as well as thresholds to identify which conditions meet these criteria. Based on these interpretations, we recommend a core panel of 64 conditions that would identify the vast majority of at-risk couples. Widespread adoption of a core panel such as this would result in a marked improvement in the number of patients currently receiving comprehensive carrier screening.",3,0,CLINICAL VALIDITY; MEDICAL-GENETICS; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; STATEMENT; STANDARDS; VARIANTS; GENOMICS,Review,2.4-S1_患者評論效度研究.csv

Despite their potential to enhance the psychosocial health of residents with dementia, there is a lack of studies that have investigated determinants of implementing pet robots in real-world practice. This study aims to explore the determinants of implementing pet robots for dementia care in nursing homes, from the perspectives of healthcare professionals and organisational leaders. Methods A descriptive qualitative study, conceptualised and guided using the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research (CFIR), was conducted. We conducted semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals and organisational leaders from nursing homes. Data was transcribed and analysed using Framework Analysis, based on the CFIR as an a priori framework. Results A total of 22 participants from eight nursing homes were included. Determinants were mapped to constructs from all five CFIR domains. Determinants relating to the characteristics of pet robots include their design, realisticness and interactivity, affordability, cleanability, perceived evidence strength and comparative advantages to live pets. Determinants relating to external influences (outer setting) include national regulatory guidelines, funding and networks with other organisations. With regards to characteristics of nursing homes (inner setting), determinants include the relevance of pet robots in relation to the needs of residents with dementia, alignment with care processes, infection control mandates and their relative priority. In the domain 'characteristics of individuals', determinants were associated with individuals' beliefs on the role of technology, desires to enhance residents' quality of life, and differential attitudes on the use of robots. Finally, in the domain 'implementation process', assessments and care planning were identified as determinants. Conclusions Overall, while sentiments around determinants within CFIR domains of pet robots' characteristics, outer setting and implementation process were similar, participants' opinions on the determinants within the 'inner setting' and 'characteristics of individuals' were more varied. This could be due to different organisational structures, disciplinary differences and personal experiences of using pet robots. Many determinants in different domains were interrelated. Findings provide a springboard for identifying and designing implementation strategies to guide the translation of pet robots from research into real-world practice.",1,0,Dementia; Implementation; Barriers; Facilitators; Social robots; Pet robots; Robotic pets; Nursing homes; Long term care; Residential care; Care homes; SAMPLE-SIZE; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH,Article,2.4-S3_情感分析醫療領域.csv

The objective of this study is to explore how patient feedback is currently used in hospitals to improve quality. Design This is a qualitative exploratory multiple case study. Data collection included nine interviews, of an average duration of 50 min, conducted between March and June 2019. Additionally, a document and secondary data analysis were performed. Setting This study was conducted in three Brazilian hospitals selected for their solid patient feedback practises. Participants Managers from the customer service, quality, nursing, operations, projects and patient experience departments of the three hospitals. Results Despite literature suggesting that organisational objectives regarding patient feedback are not clear, data show that there is managerial concern regarding the promotion of an environment capable of changing according to patient feedback. In these instances, organisational processes were structured to focus on patients' feedback and its receipt by the staff, including a non-punitive culture. Several patient feedback forms are available: voluntary events, patient surveys and informal feedback. Instruments to measure patient feedback focused on specific aspects of healthcare, to identify and clarify the problems for addressal by the management. The net promoter score was the main strategic indicator of patient feedback, used to assess the impact of improvement action. Conclusions The hospitals had established objectives that valued the patient's perspective.

Additionally, Graduate Medical Education (GME) is transitioning to adopt competency-based education methodologies including entrustable professional activities (EPAs) for objective, observable, and measurable milestone progression. The College of American Pathologists published 19 EPAs, including one for transfusion-related adverse events. This survey study includes developing EPAs for transfusion reaction evaluation and assessing residents before and after implementing these EPAs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Three transfusion reaction EPAs were developed and implemented in July 2018 for the Postgraduate Year (PGY) 2 pathology residents. An online, anonymous survey was sent to all 21 pathology trainees before and one year after EPA implementation. In July 2018 and August 2019, each survey included the same six multiple-choice, single-response, confidence questions, with a rating scale of extremely, very, slightly, or not at all confident.

Methods A search was performed for reviews on Yelp.com using the keyword ""ophthalmologist"" for the top 8 most population-dense metropolitan areas in the United States. One-star reviews were collected and classified as procedural or nonprocedural. Complaints were also categorized as clinical, nonclinical, or both. Clinical complaints cited issues such as complications, reoperations, uncontrolled pain, misdiagnosis, unclear treatment plan, etc. Nonclinical complaints included comments such as physician bedside manner, other staff interpersonal manner, wait time, brevity of appointment time, etc. Results 5,532 total reviews were assessed, of which 477 (9%) one-star reviews were included in the study for analysis. These reviews amounted to 1,120 distinct complaints. 287 (26%) were clinical in nature and 833 (74%) were nonclinical. Technical incompetence or error (50: 4%), unsatisfactory results (46: 4%), and complications (43: 4%) represented the most common clinical complaints while office staff interpersonal manner (182: 16%), wait time (174: 16%), and physician interpersonal manner (141: 13%) were the most common nonclinical complaints. Refractive surgery was the most frequently mentioned subspecialty (89: 8%). Patients undergoing an ophthalmic procedure (surgery, injection, etc.) wrote 64 reviews that resulted in 193 (17%) complaints. Nonprocedural patients wrote 413 reviews that resulted in 927 (83%) complaints. Compared with procedural reviews, nonprocedural reviews were less likely to include a clinical complaint (rate ratio, 0.3: P < .001). Discussion The majority of one-star reviews of ophthalmologists included in this study were nonclinical. Complaints referencing a procedural episode were more likely to include a clinical component in the review. In the era of intense medical consumerism and increased physician and health care institution competition for patient acquisition and retention, the characterization of excessively negative reviews allows identification of potential areas of concern for patients that use online review sites such as Yelp.com.",0,0,Healthcare delivery; online reviews; ophthalmology; patient satisfaction; practice management; PATIENT SATISFACTION; ONLINE REVIEWS; CARE; EXPERIENCE,Article,2.4-2_平台特定研究.csv

Although a high rating is desirable, it may not correlate with quality of care, experience, or other physician-specific variables. This study examined the impact of physician-specific variables, such as American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery Sports Certificate of Added Qualification (CAQ) status, years in practice, sex, and geographic location, on the PRW patient satisfaction rating and number of ratings. A list of orthopedic sports medicine surgeons was obtained from the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine database. Demographic data were recorded. Surgeon profiles were gathered from the most commonly used PRWs (Healthgrades and Vitals), and a mean rating value was recorded on a 1- to 5-star scale. The t test and analysis of variance were used for comparisons. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify factors contributing to PRW ratings. Female sex had the biggest positive effect on PRW rating (R=0.04, P=.029). The PRW rating was positively affected by the number of ratings (R=0.04, P<.001) and negatively affected by an increase in years of practice (R=0.04, P<.001). Surgeons with fewer than 10 years in practice had higher PRW ratings than surgeons practicing longer than 10 years. The PRW ratings were not affected by sports CAQ status or geographic location. Fewer years in practice, female sex, and greater number of reviews were associated with higher PRW ratings. Number of reviews was the only modifiable factor.

Methods: A search for reviews was performed on Yelp.com using the keyword ""Otolaryngologist"" in four major urban cities in the United States. On a five-star scale, one-star reviews were isolated, classified as clinical or non-clinical complaints, and further subcategorized. Chi-square analysis was used to determine differences in complaint types between patients reporting surgery and those who did not. Results: From the 7653 reviews that were surveyed, 375 one-star reviews met the inclusion criteria and were used in the analysis. These negative reviews yielded 808 total complaints, 25 % were clinical, and 75 % were non-clinical. The most common clinical complaints were a lack of diagnosis, disagreement with the treatment plan and misdiagnosis, whereas the most common non-clinical complaints included poor physician bedside manner, cost, and unprofessional staff. Fifty-two (14 %) patients reported having surgery. The difference in the number of complaints by patients reporting surgery and patients not reporting surgery was statistically significant (P < .05) for almost all subcategories. Conclusion: The most common complaints in negative reviews of Otolaryngologists on Yelp are non-clinical, primarily centered around the professionalism of the physician and staff.

Expected adverse events following immunization are a major source of concern and play a role in the emergence of vaccine hesitancy. Since nocebo mechanisms are involved in the perception of adverse reactions, positive side-effect communication is warranted. The aim of the present study was to compile a comprehensive communication strategy that minimizes expectations of nocebo effects while respecting the informed consent procedure. Method: In a randomized 2 x 2 between-subject design, 652 participants received information about COVID-19 or influenza vaccination using either standard side-effect messaging or messaging enriched with proven elements of expectation-optimizing framing. A physician presented information online via video. Moderation analyses were conducted to examine effects among particular subpopulations. Expected adverse event ratings following an imagined immunization, cost-benefit ratios of the vaccination, and future vaccination intentions were assessed. Results: Information content ratings were equally high in each group. Positive framing significantly decreased adverse event expectations in the COVID-19 information group and raised the cost-benefit ratio in the influenza condition, indicating higher benefits than cost expectations. Moderation analysis revealed that the framed side-effect communication lowered the expected COVID-19 vaccination uptake willingness in individuals with strong anti-vaccination attitudes. Conclusions: Facing the ongoing coronavirus mass vaccinations, positive information frames have a small but significant impact on vaccination concerns while upholding informed consent. Although intervention trials are still pending, this approach could help decrease vaccine hesitancy by reducing fearful expectations. However, it seems that it should not be used without considering vaccination attitudes.",0,0,vaccine hesitancy; adverse events following immunization; nocebo; framing; PERCEIVED SENSITIVITY; POWER; EXPECTATIONS,Article,2.4-4_線上評分研究.csv

With the overlap between upper and lower airway disease, optimal management of the upper airways is undertaken in conjunction with that of the lower airways. Biologic therapy with targeted activity within the Type 2 inflammatory pathway can improve the clinical signs and symptoms of both upper and lower airway diseases. Knowledge gaps nevertheless exist in how best to approach patient care as a whole. There have been sixteen randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trails performed for CRSwNP targeted components of the Type 2 inflammatory pathway, notably interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13, IL- 5R, IL-33, and immunoglobulin (Ig)E. This white paper considers the perspectives of experts in various disciplines such as rhinology, allergy, and respirology across Canada, all of whom have unique and valuable insights to contribute on how to best approach patients with upper airway disease from a multidisciplinary perspective. Methods A Delphi Method process was utilized involving three rounds of questionnaires in which the first two were completed individually online and the third was discussed on a virtual platform with all the panelists. A national multidisciplinary expert panel of 34 certified specialists was created, composed of 16 rhinologists, 7 allergists, and 11 respirologists who evaluated the 20 original statements on a scale of 1-9 and provided comments. All ratings were quantitively reviewed by mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation and inter-rater reliability. Consensus was defined by relative interrater reliability measures-kappa coefficient (kappa) value > 0.61. Results After three rounds, a total of 22 statements achieved consensus. This white paper only contains the final agreed upon statements and clear rationale and support for the statements regarding the use of biologics in patients with upper airway disease. Conclusion This white paper provides guidance to Canadian physicians on the use of biologic therapy for the management of upper airway disease from a multidisciplinary perspective, but the medical and surgical regimen should ultimately be individualized to the patient.

Lebanon has been greatly affected by the pandemic, having faced concomitant financial and economic crises. The objective of the study was to understand the experiences of patients with COVID-19 in Lebanon, as well as those of their families, and healthcare providers, with regards to their treatment decisions and accessibility to COVID-19 medicines.Methods For this qualitative study, we conducted 28 semi-structured interviews. We used purposive sampling to recruit participants with a diverse range of perspectives. The data collection phase spanned from August to November 2021 and was conducted virtually. After transcribing and translating the interviews, we employed thematic analysis to identify recurring themes and patterns.Results In total, 28 individuals participated in this study. Participants highlighted challenges owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis. Accessing COVID-19 medicines posed major hurdles for physicians and patients, given limited availability, global shortages, local circumstances, community hoarding and stockpiling by pharmacies. Providers based treatment decisions on research, local and international practice guidelines, experiences and expert feedback. Patients sought information from social media, community members and physicians, as well as through word of mouth. Accessing medicines involved navigating the healthcare system, the black market, charities, personal networks and political parties and sourcing from abroad. The medicines were either free, subsidized or at inflated costs.Conclusions This study highlights the diversity and complexity of factors influencing decision-making and accessing medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic in Lebanon.

Accordingly, medical professionals and health-related institutions reach out to patients and seek feedback to analyze, monitor, and uplift medical services. Such views and perceptions are often shared on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. Twitter is the most popular and commonly used by the researcher as an online platform for instant access to real-time news, opinions, and discussion. Its trending hashtags (#) and viral content make it an ideal hub for monitoring public opinion on a variety of topics. The tweets are extracted using three hashtags #healthcare, #healthcare services, and #medical facilities. Also, location and tweet sentiment analysis are considered in this study. Several recent studies deployed Twitter datasets using ML and DL models, but the results show lower accuracy. In addition, the studies did not perform extensive comparative analysis and lack validation. This study addresses two research questions: first, what are the sentiments of people toward medical services worldwide? and second, how effective are the machine learning and deep learning approaches for the classification of sentiment on healthcare tweets? Experiments are performed using several well-known machine learning models including support vector machine, logistic regression, Gaussian naive Bayes, extra tree classifier, k nearest neighbor, random forest, decision tree, and AdaBoost. In addition, this study proposes a transfer learning-based LSTM-ETC model that effectively predicts the customer's satisfaction level from the healthcare dataset. Results indicate that despite the best performance by the ETC model with an 0.88 accuracy score, the proposed model outperforms with a 0.95 accuracy score. Predominantly, the people are happy about the provided medical services as the ratio of the positive sentiments is substantially higher than the negative sentiments.

Identification of ULVH patients allows for early targeted treatment and family screening. AimTo automatically identify patients with ULVH in electronic health record (EHR) data using two computer methods: text-mining and machine learning (ML). MethodsAdults with echocardiographic measurement of interventricular septum thickness (IVSt) were included. A text-mining algorithm was developed to identify patients with ULVH. An ML algorithm including a variety of clinical, ECG and echocardiographic data was trained and tested in an 80/20% split. Clinical diagnosis of ULVH was considered the gold standard. Misclassifications were reviewed by an experienced cardiologist. Sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative likelihood ratios (LHR+ and LHR-) of both text-mining and ML were reported. ResultsIn total, 26,954 subjects (median age 61 years, 55% male) were included. ULVH was diagnosed in 204/26,954 (0.8%) patients, of which 56 had amyloidosis and two Anderson-Fabry Disease. Text-mining flagged 8,192 patients with possible ULVH, of whom 159 were true positives (sensitivity, specificity, LHR+, and LHR- of 0.78, 0.67, 2.36, and 0.33). Machine learning resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, LHR+, and LHR- of 0.32, 0.99, 32, and 0.68, respectively. Pivotal variables included IVSt, systolic blood pressure, and age. ConclusionsAutomatic identification of patients with ULVH is possible with both Text-mining and ML. Text-mining may be a comprehensive scaffold but can be less specific than machine learning.

Therefore, this study aimed to explore the perspectives of patients with CRD, carers and interested citizens regarding the relevance and need for a PPI network and suggestions for its implementation.MethodsA qualitative study based on focus groups was conducted. Recruitment occurred through invitations on social media platforms and to patients who have participated in previous asthma studies of the team. Three focus groups were conducted, via video conference, using a semi-structured guide. Thematic analysis was performed by two independent researchers and discussed with the extended team.ResultsFifteen patients with CRD, one carer and one interested citizen (13 females, median 36 (range: 18-72) years) participated. All participants acknowledged the importance of implementing a collaborative network and demonstrated interest in being integrated. Participants acknowledged the importance of their involvement in several phases of the research cycle. The main aim identified for this network was to facilitate communication between patients and researchers. Participants regarded the integration of patients, carers, researchers and healthcare professionals from different scientific areas as relevant. The use of digital platforms to attract members and support the work, together with group dynamics and regular meetings, were some of the most relevant practical considerations for implementing the network. The identified facilitators for their engagement were sharing experiences, researchers' and healthcare professionals' support and feedback and schedule flexibility. The identified barriers included the amount of time dedicated, low health/digital literacy and the potential detachment of nondiagnosed patients or those with low symptom impact in daily life.ConclusionPatients, carers and citizens acknowledged the relevance of implementing a collaborative network and demonstrated interest in active participation in every stage of the health research cycle. A deeper knowledge of the barriers and facilitators identified in this study could support implementing these initiatives in Portugal.Patient or Public ContributionThis study was designed by a research team that included one patient with asthma and one carer. They were specifically involved in building the study protocol and the interview guide. They also gave feedback regarding the electronic consent form and the short sociodemographic questionnaire created, namely by removing noncontributing words or phrases and rewording expressions. The lay summary was written by another patient with asthma. All participants of this study were invited to implement and integrate the ConectAR network-a collaborative network of research in respiratory health.Public SummaryIn Portugal, chronic respiratory patients do not have an active role as 'coinvestigators'. This study aimed to acknowledge if patients and citizens considered a patient and public involvement network useful, whose main purpose would be to facilitate communication between patients and researchers. A study based on online group interviews was carried out with patients with chronic respiratory diseases and interested citizens, both recruited on social media platforms. Participants considered that bringing together patients, carers, researchers and healthcare professionals is valuable because sharing different experiences and perspectives may help patients to improve their daily lives and increase research quality.",0,0,asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; chronic respiratory disease; citizen science; patient and public involvement,Article,2.4-3_社交媒體回饋.csv

A further domain was created to capture participants' perspectives on using the IoT in PCOS management. Mobile apps appear to be useful for menstrual cycle tracking, symptom recording, and education. Despite concerns regarding the quality and reliability of social media content, these platforms may play an important role in disseminating PCOS-related information. Wearables facilitate detailed symptom monitoring and improve communication with healthcare providers. Machine learning algorithms show promising results in PCOS diagnosis accuracy, risk prediction, and app development. Although abundant, PCOS-related content on websites may lack quality and cultural considerations. While patients express concerns about online misinformation, they consider online forums valuable for peer connection.

The purpose of this article is to provide a blueprint for using human-centered design (HCD) methods to maximize the potential for implementation, by sharing the example of a youth-, family-, and clinician-engaged process of creating an mHealth intervention aimed at promoting healthcare transition readiness.Method Following HCD methods in partnership with three advisory councils, we conducted semistructured interviews with 13- to 15-year-old patients and their caregivers in two phases. In Phase 1, participants described challenges during the transition journey, and generated ideas regarding the format, content, and other qualities of the mHealth tool. For Phase 2, early adolescents and caregivers provided iterative feedback on two sequential intervention prototypes. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis in Phase 1 and the rapid assessment process for Phase 2.Results We interviewed 11 youth and 8 caregivers. The sample included adolescents with a range of chronic health conditions. In Phase 1, participants supported the idea of developing an autonomy-building tool, delivering transition readiness education via social media style videos. In Phase 2, participants responded positively to the successive prototypes and provided suggestions to make information accessible, relatable, and engaging.Conclusions The procedures shared in this article could inform other researchers' plans to apply HCD in collaboration with implementation partners to develop mHealth interventions.

ASP interventions often contain an educational component; however, current guidelines suggest that educational interventions should not be used alone but to support other stewardship interventions. Such interventions are most commonly directed towards prescribers (often general practice physicians) with few studies offering education towards other healthcare providers such as pharmacists, nurses, or even members of the stewardship team. Educational interventions are offered most frequently, but not exclusively, with concomitant stewardship interventions such as prospective audit and feedback. Such strategies appear to positively impact prescribing behaviours, but it is not possible to isolate the effect of education from other interventions. Common educational methods include one-time seminars and online e-learning modules, but unique strategies such as social media platforms, educational video games and problem-based teaming modules have also been employed. Education directed towards patients often occurs in conjunction with education of local prescribers and wider community-based efforts to impact prescribing. Such studies evaluating patient education often include passive educational leaflets and focus most often on appropriate treatment of upper respiratory tract infections. Educational interventions appear to be an integral component of other interventions of ASPs; however, there is a paucity of evidence to support use as a stand-alone intervention outside of regional public health interventions. Future studies should focus on efficacy of educational interventions including providing education to non-prescribers and disease states beyond upper respiratory tract infections to demonstrate a broader role for education in ASP activities.

Participants ' understanding regarding the possible consequences of anaemia in pregnancy was also explored. Feedback on a proposed randomised controlled trial of daily versus alternate day oral iron in pregnancy was sought. Materials & methods: Following ethical approval, fourteen semi -structured one-to-one interviews were carried out using an interview tool with open-ended questions. Recruitment was carried out through social media and from an antenatal out -patient setting. Interviews were audio -recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results: Fatigue emerged as a predominant and troubling symptom. Awareness was often highlighted through friends/family and from healthcare professionals, particularly in first pregnancies. Knowledge surrounding the potential short-term and long-term adverse consequences of untreated anaemia however was limited. Gastro-intestinal side -effects, a previous experience of poor tolerance and forgetfulness all negatively impacted compliance with oral iron supplementation in pregnancy. Routine, a perceived improvement in fatigue with supplementation and reduced dose frequency recurred as themes which positively affected compliance. Pregnancy as a motivating factor recurred as a theme in analysis. The role of diet was felt to be important. Knowledge of iron -rich foods and absorption aids and inhibitors was good, but practice on optimal ingestion of oral iron supplementation varied. Feedback on trial acceptability was positive with the benefit of extra supportive care noted. Incorporating study visits with routine care was advised in view of time constraints. This area of research was perceived as important. Conclusion: In order to successfully reduce the rates of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy, it is crucial that all factors affecting compliance with oral iron are considered.

Similarly, dengue occurs in the star of the rainy season in early May and reaches its peak in late June. Dengue and flu brought an impact on various countries in the years 2017-2019 and streaming Twitter data reveals the status of dengue and flu outbreaks in the most affected regions. This research work presents that Social Media Analysis (SMA) can be used as a detector of the epidemic outbreak and to understand the sentiment of social media users regarding various diseases. Providing awareness about seasonal outbreaks through SMA is an effective approach for researchers and healthcare responders to detect the early outbreaks. The proposed model aims to find the sentiment about the disease in tweets, and the seasonal outbreaks-related tweets are classified into two classes as disease positive and disease negative. This work proposes a machine-learning-based approach to detect dengue and flu outbreaks in social media platform Twitter, using four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT), with the help of Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). For experimental analysis, two datasets (dengue and flu) are analyzed individually. The experimental results show that the RF classifier has outperformed the comparison models in terms of improved accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measure, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

PRW in Germany has been in existence for a decade; this study aims to provide an overview of the current level of their significance for both patients and the health care system. Methods (1) A systematic internet search was carried out to identify German PRW. (2) Online-derived cross-sectional data (N=1,044 respondents) were analyzed with respect to awareness, usage, and impact of PRW as well as patient preferences when searching online for physicians. (3) An analysis of the structure of online ratings for a random sample of 11% of German dermatologists was conducted. Results In total, we identified 29 PRWs. Slightly more than half of all respondents (54%) were aware of German PRW and every fourth respondent has already used PRW to search for a physician. Approximately 70% of all users stated they had already made a decision for or against a particular physician based on the quality ratings shown on PRW. Almost all dermatologists could be identified on PRW and 93% have already been rated on any PRW (mean number of ratings: 24.55). More than half of all ratings (55%) were positive.

The basis of suspicion was clinico-eco-epidemiologic-radiological findings as, by that time, about 20 COVID19 cases were reported from the state of Rajasthan including a big Italian group of tourists who travelled extensively in Rajasthan, including Udaipur city. Objectives: The current study presents the field experience of the Central and the State Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) in the cluster containment at Bhilwara. Methods: The information regarding the sociodemographic profile of the cases was provided by the Senior Medical Officer In-charge. The containment strategy was modeled under 6 pillars. Google Maps was used for preparing spot map. Results: Immediate public health actions of cluster containment including contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation were initiated using epidemiological approach of mapping the cluster and taking care of reservoir of infection by the District Public Health Team supported by Multidisciplinary Rapid Response Team. This was supplemented by strict enforcement of lock down in the District taking care of daily need of the community by the leadership of administration with very strong intersectoral co-ordination (locally called ""ruthless containment""). Conclusion: The forthcoming challenge resides in re-establishment of inter-district and inter-state travel, which can become a risk of re-entry of the new cases, which needs to be taken care of, with the help of stringent administrative measures and screening at all points of entry.

With the Reproduction Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care, and Transparency Act repealed, CPCs are no longer mandated to share information on state-funded family planning and abortion services. As patients increasingly seek healthcare guidance online, we evaluated crowd-sourced reviews of CPCs using the social networking site Yelp. Methods CPCs were identified with the CPC Map, a geo-based location resource. Of California's 145 CPCs, 84% had Yelp pages, and 619 reviews (2010-2019) were extracted. Thematic codes were individually applied to 220 excerpts and then analyzed in detail using thematic analysis to capture emergent themes related to motivations for and experiences of CPCs. To ensure thematic saturation, we applied a natural language-processing technique called the meaning extraction method to computationally derive themes of discussion from all of the extracted posts. Results Motivations to seek care from CPCs included pregnancy confirmation, gaps in healthcare coverage, parenting and emotional support, and abortion care. A review of experiences reveal that CPC faith-based practice garnered both positive- and negative-based experiences. Reviewers also articulated inaccurate medical information, lack of transparency, and reduced options at CPCs. Conclusions This is the first study to analyze California CPCs using a social media platform. Pregnant patients turn to social media to share experiences about pregnancy resources, to find healthcare providers, and to increase transparency of services. This content provides valuable insight into the concerns of pregnant patients and offers an intimate view of California CPCs at a time when no federal regulations are in place.",0,0,abortion care; crisis pregnancy center (CPC); public policy; reproductive health; HEALTH; INFORMATION; SERVICES; CARE,Article,2.4-2_平台特定研究.csv

Methods: Topical and sentiment analysis was conducted using natural language processing (NLP) of Google and Yelp caregiver reviews (n = 3393) between 2013-2023 using Google NLP. Stratified sampling weighted by hospice size to approximate the daily census of US hospice enrollees. Results: Overall caregiver sentiment of hospice care was neutral (S = .14). Therapeutic, achievable expectations and misperceptions, unachievable expectations were, respectively, the most and least prevalent domains. Four topics with the highest prevalence, all had moderately positive sentiments: caring staff, staff professionalism and knowledge; emotional, spiritual, bereavement support; and responsive, timely or helpful. Lowest sentiments scores were lack of staffing; promises made, but not kept, pain, symptoms and medications; sped-up death, hasted, or sedated; and money, staff motivations. Significance of Results: Caregivers overall rating of hospice was neutral, largely due to moderate sentiment on achievable expectations in two-thirds of reviews mixed with unachievable expectations in one-sixth of reviews. Hospice caregivers were most likely to recommend hospices with caring staff, providing quality care, responsive to requests, and offering family support. Lack of staff, inadequate pain-symptom management were the two biggest barriers to hospice quality. All eight CAHPS measures were found in the discovered review topics. Close-ended CAHPS scores and open-ended online reviews have complementary insights.

It remains an attractive treatment option because it is efficacious, reasonably well tolerated and easy to administer. However, data on resource implications in the UK for both patients and healthcare providers are limited.Methods:We conducted a retrospective study of 127 patients to assess implications of bortezomib therapy on patients and healthcare resources. A patient-episode was defined as a patient attending the chemotherapy day treatment unit solely for bortezomib administration. Data were collected for the duration of therapy as follows: cost of drug calculated using the UK's bortezomib indicative price as per British National Formulary, cost of drug administration in the chemotherapy day treatment unit calculated using the National Health Service's schedule of service cost, time from check-in to drug administration, patient travel time and distance calculated using Google maps, and cost of travel.Results:Median drug cost and administration cost per patient were 8336 pound (2084- pound 108,368) pound and 4640 pound (290- pound 15,080) pound, respectively. Median time from check-in to administration was 63 min (range 5-433), median travel time was 90 min (range 8-270) and 80 min (range 8-280) during peak and off-peak periods, respectively. Median return travel distance was 33.4 miles (range 1.2-224) for travel cost per patient per trip was 8.35- pound 13.20 pound.

A range of dedicated guidelines provide for best practice at local and national levels, but concerns exist regarding the quality of these encounters for all involved. Methods: A narrative review was conducted to explore quality principles underpinning practices and reporting of independent medical examinations. Quality was defined by dimensions outlined by the World Health Organization (effectiveness, safety, people-centredness, timeliness, equity, integration of care, efficiency). Academic (databases: Medline, CINAHL, Embase) and grey literature (advanced Google search) published in English was searched with no date limits. Results were synthesised according to the components of independent medical examinations (independent medical examiner approval and selection, independent medical examinations, reporting) and then mapped to quality dimensions. Results: The quality dimensions of effectiveness, safety, person-centredness, timeliness, equity, and efficiency were partly addressed in existing independent medical examination practices, most commonly within the examination itself. However, there were prominent gaps in person-centredness and integration of care across all stages of the examination and reporting process. Opportunities for strengthening quality practices included: inviting community members with lived experience of workplace injury to serve on boards responsible for appointing independent medical examiners; explicitly encouraging questions and perspectives from injured works during examinations; holistic reporting that accurately captures injured workers' experiences; consultations with usual treating teams prior to report finalisation and submission; and providing verbal summaries and/ or reports directly to injured workers. Conclusion: Although some quality principles were evident in existing independent medical examination practices described in the literature, unlike the acute and community healthcare sectors, the notion of quality was not universally applied in this context. To promote evidence-based practice, foster positive cultural shifts, and enhance experiences of injured workers and independent medical examiners, formally embedding a comprehensive quality experience in independent medical examination programs is recommended.",0,0,Independent medical evaluation; Injured worker; Quality improvement; Quality indicators; health care; Quality of health care; Workers' compensation; COMPENSATION; CARE; ILLNESS,Review,2.4-2_平台特定研究.csv
Reducing Student Nurse Stigmatization of the Patient Who Misuses Opioids A Scoping Review,"Maynard, Kristi; LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS; Maynard, Kristi; Maynard, Kristi",2020,JOURNAL OF ADDICTIONS NURSING,10.1097/JAN.0000000000000324,WOS:000526707500008,USA,"The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic. The numbers of opioid-related deaths have been steadily climbing, magnifying the need for innovative intervention. Stigma is a set of preconceived, negative assumptions about a patient population or group. Stigma is a known deterrent to communication and the delivery of healthcare. Nurses serve as a primary contact for many marginalized patients within the healthcare system. The purpose of this scoping review is to gather known data on the use of educational interventions with nursing students to reduce stigmatizing tendencies. Inclusion criteria constituted an educational intervention involving student nurses and an effort to reduce stigmatizing attitudes toward patients who misuse opioids. The intervention must have taken place in an institute of higher learning between the years of 2003 and 2018. Exclusion criteria included community-wide studies. A single study was identified addressing nursing student reduction of stigmatization of the individual who uses opioids, and so, the search was expanded to include any student nursing intervention developed to reduce stigma toward any marginalized population. The following electronic databases were utilized in the search process: Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Google Scholar, Journal Storage, Microsoft Academic, and ScienceDirect.

The care cascade is multi-folded and complex in setting where the health system is reforming for its resilience. India, one of the countries with the highest burden of tuberculosis mortality and morbidity, is not an exception to this complexity. With the diverse challenges in the Indian health system and societal diversity, it is essential to understand the factors contributing to this TB care cascade. Thus, this study aims to map all the contributing factors to the TB care cascade in India. Further, it also captures the different patterns of factors explored so far in different countries' regions. This systematic literature review was conducted between October 2020 and February 2021 in India using PubMed databases, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Two reviewers extracted the data from eligible studies to summarize and tabulate important findings. Data were extracted and tabulated for study design, location of the study, type of TB patients, methodological approach, system side challenges, and demand-side challenges in the study's findings. Out of 692 initial hits from the literature search, 28 studies were finally included to synthesize evidence in this review as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. This review provides an insight into different factors such as the system-side (health workforce, institutional) and the demand-side (individual, societal) contributing towards the care cascade. The prime factors reflected in most of the studies were socio-economic condition, disease awareness, myths/beliefs, addictions among the demand side factors and accessibility, the attitude of the healthcare staff, delay in referral for diagnosis among the system-side factors.

The Impact of Process- vs. Outcome-Oriented Reviews on the Sales of Healthcare Services,"Li, Hongfei; Peng, Jing; Wang, Gang; Bai, Xue; INFORMS; Li, Hongfei; Peng, Jing; Wang, Gang; Bai, Xue; Peng, Jing; Li, Hongfei; Peng, Jing; Peng, Jing",2024,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,10.1287/isre.2019.0168,WOS:001171033300001,Peoples R China; USA,"The consumption of services inherently requires a process to achieve the desired outcome. For nonexperiential services (e.g., healthcare and education) primarily valued for their end outcomes, their consumption typically involves lengthy processes that are not designed for enjoyment (e.g., wound care and lecture attendance). Consequently, there exists a prominent tension between the processes (means) and outcomes (ends) of these services, which is largely ignored in the prior literature on user-generated content (UGC) that predominantly focuses on products (e.g., books and electronics) or experiential services (e.g., dining and lodging). To bridge this gap, we investigate the distinct roles of process- and outcome-oriented reviews in influencing consumers' decisions to pursue healthcare services, leveraging a comprehensive data set collected from an online platform for cosmetic procedures. By separating process- and outcome-oriented reviews through visual content analysis, we show that the effect of outcome-oriented reviews in boosting the sales of healthcare services is almost twice stronger than that of process-oriented reviews on average. However, the relative effectiveness of these two types of reviews varies substantially across different types of healthcare services. Specifically, we find that process-oriented reviews are more influential in affecting consumers' purchases of services with higher complexity, in contrast to outcome-oriented reviews that are more impactful for services with lower complexity. Moreover, the impact of process-oriented reviews is stronger for less popular services, whereas the impact of outcome-oriented reviews is stronger for more popular services. These nuanced findings show that consumers resort to different types of UGC while considering different types of healthcare services.

However, information quality is rarely optimal since it takes time to determine the information of relevance. The COVID-19 pandemic showed that even official data sources are far from optimal since they suffer from reporting delays that slow decision-making. To support decision-makers with timely information, we utilize data from online social networks to propose an adaptable information extraction solution to create indices helping to forecast COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalization rates. We show that combining heterogeneous data sources like Twitter and Reddit can leverage these sources' inherent complementarity and yield better predictions than those using a single data source alone. We further show that the predictions run ahead of the official COVID-19 incidences by up to 14 days. Additionally, we highlight the importance of model adjustments whenever new information becomes available or the underlying data changes by observing distinct changes in the presence of specific symptoms on Reddit.",0,0,User -generated content; Natural language processing; Decision support system; Pandemic preparedness; Healthcare disaster management; MISLEADING INFORMATION; TIME; PREDICTION; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM,Article,2.4-5_用戶生成內容.csv

Early detection of indicators for RNT across disorders is needed. To this end we explored the psychometric properties of a transdiagnostic measure, i.e., the Swedish version of the brief Repetitive Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ-10), in adults (n = 674, age: 18 years or older). Methods: Participants completed an online battery of questionnaires measuring RNT, anxiety, depression and levels of positive and negative affect, satisfaction with life, metacognitive beliefs, and sick leave. Reliability and validity were evaluated with Cronbach's alpha, item and scale correlations, factor analysis (including multigroup analysis), and multiple linear regression analysis. Principal component analysis and exploratory factor analysis were first carried out to identify the number of latent factors. Confirmatory factor analysis was then used to assess the model fit of a single latent factor. Results: Analyses supported a single-factor solution. Results showed that the reliability was excellent. The single-factor model was robust, except across levels of distress that did not support scalar invariance. Negative metacognitive beliefs, negative affect, and anxiety were strong covariates demonstrating convergent validity. Negative and weaker correlations with life satisfaction, positive affect, and physical symptoms contributed to the discriminant validity. Conclusion: This study showed that the instrument is robust in a population with various degrees of affective symptoms and distress. These results provide additional psychometric support for the RTQ-10 as a transdiagnostic measure. It can be administered online to assess RNT as a risk factor for emotional disorders.",0,0,Assessment; Psychological disorders; Repetitive negative thinking; COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; NEGATIVE THINKING; HOSPITAL ANXIETY; DEPRESSION SCALE; RATING-SCALE; WORRY; RUMINATION; SAMPLE; VALIDATION; THOUGHT,Article,2.4-4_線上評分研究.csv

Methods Online patient review scores of US physician members of the American Autonomic Society were compared to scores of US physicians in general and to indices of professional expertise. Results The 68 autonomic physicians who had been rated scored 3.80 +/- 0.82 on a composite five-star scale, in which 5 was the most favorable score, as compared to 3.84 +/- 0.98 for all US physicians (no significant difference, p = 0.8). Scores correlated inversely with autonomic physicians' number of scientific publications (p = 0.01), h-index (p = 0.01), and m-index (p = 0.0004). Scores of diplomates of the United Council for Neurologic Subspecialties certified in autonomic disorders or who were ranked in the top 1% of US physicians by Castle Connolly had scores comparable to those of other autonomic physicians. Scores did not correlate with physician gender, number of reviews, or years in practice. Conclusion A quality patient experience, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate treatment are goals shared by patients and autonomic specialists. In this study, patient reviews of autonomic physicians were comparable to those of physicians across specialties. Metrics of greater autonomic expertise were associated with equal or lower patient satisfaction scores. In conclusion, compiled subjective reviews are a useful but incomplete indicator of autonomic physician quality and expertise.

Applying Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) can help researchers categorize sentiments toward specific aspects such as drug effectiveness, side effects, and treatment experiences. These insights are highly useful for healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, and researchers to assess drug efficacy and safety, utilizing the vast amount of healthcare-related user-generated content available online. However, due to scarcity of annotated data for training ABSA models in the medical domain poses challenges in accurately extracting aspect terms. Also, the identification of implicit aspects poses a huge challenge as they frequently lack explicit names or keywords that directly indicate their presence. The domain-dependent nature of ABSA and the variability of term meanings across domains necessitate the incorporation of contextual information and semantic patterns. Therefore, we propose a novel model called Multi-task Learning based Dual Bidirectional LSTM Model (MLDBM) for ABSA of drug reviews. The MLDBM leverages BERT and incorporates a multi-head self-attention mechanism to produce aspect-specific representations which are further processed through the dual BiLSTM model. This enables the model to capture and analyze sentiments related to different aspects discussed in the reviews. We also introduce various modifications to the MLDBM to identify the constraints of the proposed model. The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models by achieving a performance gain of 8% to 12% on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness when compared to various baseline models. ABSA applied to drug reviews contributes to enhancing healthcare quality by considering different aspects of drugs as shared by consumers.",0,0,Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis; Attention; BERT; Deep Learning; Drug Reviews; Dual BiLSTM; Multi-Head Self-Attention; Multi-task Learning; ATTENTION,Article,2.4-5_用戶生成內容.csv

Parents are the main integrators of long-term educational and healthcare service for their child with ASD. . Design/methodology/approach Design/methodology/approach included (1) a sentiment analysis of discussion forum posts from an autism message board using a rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media and (2) a qualitative content analysis of one-on-one interviews with parents of children diagnosed with ASD, complemented with interviews with experienced educators and clinicians. Findings Findings reveal the link between customized service integration and long-term benefits. Both parents and service providers emphasize the need to integrate healthcare and educational service to create holistic long-term care for a child with ASD. Parents highlight the benefits of varied services, but availability or cost are burdens if the service is not publicly provided, or covered by insurance. Service providers' lack of experience with ASD and people's ignorance of the challenges of ASD are burdens. Practical implications Ensuring health outcomes for a child with ASD requires an integrated service system and long-term, customer-centric service process because the scope of service covers the child's entire childhood. Customized educational and healthcare service must be allocated and budgeted early in order to reach the goal of a satisfactory service output for each child. Originality/value This is the first service research to focus on parents' challenges with obtaining services for their child with ASD. This paper provides service researchers and managers insight into parents' perceptions of educational and healthcare service value (i.e. benefits vs. burdens) received for their child with ASD. These insights into customer-centric perceptions of value may be useful to research and may help service providers to innovate and provide integrated service directly to parents, or indirectly to service providers, who serve children with ASD.",0,0,Value; Service; Educational service; Healthcare service; Benefits; Burdens; ASD; Autism; VBHC; Value-based healthcare; AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER; YOUNG-CHILDREN; TEACHER RELATIONSHIPS; COPING STRATEGIES; CARE EXPERIENCES; FAMILIES; INNOVATION; NEEDS; EXPENDITURES; CHALLENGES,Article,2.4-S3_情感分析醫療領域.csv

The South-Asian (SA) countries have witnessed both the initial brunt of the outbreak as well as the ongoing rise of cases. Their unique challenges in relation to mental health during the pandemic are worth exploring. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted for all the original studies on the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown on psychological health/well-being in the SA countries of the World Psychiatric Association Zone 16. PubMed, Google Scholar, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, and SCOPUS were searched till June 2020. Studies conducted in the age group of 18-60 years with a minimum sample size of 10, and statistically significant results were included. Results: Thirteen studies were included in the review. They showed increase prevalence in nonpsychotic depression, anxiety, somatic concerns, alcohol-related disorders, and insomnia in the general population. Psychological symptoms correlated more with physical complaints of fatigue and pain in older adults and were directly related to social media use, misinformation, xenophobia, and social distancing. Frontline workers reported guilt, stigma, anxiety, and poor sleep quality, which were related to the lack of availability of adequate personal protective equipment, increased workload, and discrimination. One study validated the Coronavirus anxiety scale in the Indian population while another explored gaming as a double-edged sword during the lockdown in adolescents. Another study from Bangladesh explored psychosexual health during lockdown. Most studies were cross-sectional online surveys, used screening tools and had limited accessibility.

Objective To evaluate knowledge and awareness about potential barriers to medication adherence, and to evaluate strategies used in clinical practice by Portuguese clinicians on how to foster medication adherence of patients undergoing secondary cardiovascular prevention. Setting Nominal Group Technique (NGT) at the University of Lisbon; online survey addressed to physicians working in primary and secondary care in Portugal. Method A narrative literature review was conducted in Pubmed to identify studies describing interventions targeted at physicians to manage medication adherence. The NGT included 12 allied healthcare professionals with recognized expertise in medication adherence and was organised in four phases, resulting in survey development. The survey was used in a cross-sectional national study where clinicians reported their knowledge and perceptions about patients' medication adherence and their daily practice. Main outcome measures Knowledge and awareness about barriers to medication adherence; and practice patterns. Results A total of 296 papers were identified, 26 of which were included. Four main topics were selected to be used in the NGT: adherence determinants, detecting non-adherence, fostering adherence, and educating physicians. NGT resulted in a survey, reaching 451 physicians, mostly practicing in primary care. Most had specific education on medication adherence and considered patient interviews and prescription records the most useful assessment methods. Nonetheless, many recognised often using clinical judgement to evaluate adherence in practice. Barriers to medication adherence were perceived to occur often during implementation. Most perceived reasons for uncontrolled hypertension were non-adherence to lifestyle recommendations and to medication. Less than half the physicians asked their patients if medication was taken. More useful enabling strategies included reducing daily doses, reviewing therapeutic options and motivational interventions. Conclusions Clinicians seem well informed about the importance of medication adherence and aware of problems encountered in practice.

MS-Excel template was created with key domains for assessing DHT in resource-constrained settings based on studies and reports identified. Responses received from seventeen experts with varying expertise in DHT, HTA, clinical, and research were contacted using an online form. Following the principles of qualitative research rooted on grounded theory approach, themes and domains were derived for a framework which was again circulated through participants. Weightage for each theme was assigned based on the frequency of responses and qualifiers were used to interpret results. Inductively derived themes from these responses were clubbed together to identify macro-level systems requirements, and finally pre-requisites for setting up DHT-HTA framework was synthesized.Results HT are commonly perceived by experts (64.7 percent participants) as a technology strictly connected to health information. Real-world data (i.e., electronic health data) are recognized as a relevant tool in support of decision-making for clinical and managerial levels. Experts identified some pre-requisites for the establishment of DHT-HTA in the country in terms of infrastructure, contextual factors, training, finance, data security, and scale-up.Conclusion Our research not only identified the pre-requisites for the adoption of a DHT-HTA framework for India, but confirmed the need to address DHT-HTA's acceptability among.

We aimed to collate an individual patient-level data set from large, high-quality pre-ex-isting studies on pneumonia in children to identify a set of signs and symptoms with greater validity in the diagnosis, prognosis, and possible treatment of childhood pneumonia for the improvement of cur-rent pneumonia case management guidelines. Methods Using data from a published systematic review and expert knowledge, we identified stud-ies meeting our eligibility criteria and invited inves-tigators to share individual-level patient data. We collected data on demographic information, general medical history, and current illness episode, includ-ing history, clinical presentation, chest radiograph findings when available, treatment, and outcome. Data were gathered separately from hospital-based and community-based cases. We performed a narra-tive synthesis to describe the final data set. Results Forty-one separate data sets were includ-ed in the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations (PREPARE) database, 26 of which were hospital-based and 15 were commu-nity-based. The PREPARE database includes 285 839 children with pneumonia (244 323 in the hospital and 41 516 in the community), with detailed de-scriptions of clinical presentation, clinical progres-sion, and outcome. Of 9185 pneumonia-related deaths, 6836 (74%) occurred in children <1 year of age and 1317 (14%) in children aged 1-2 years. Of the 285 839 episodes, 280 998 occurred in chil-dren 0-59 months old, of which 129 584 (46%) were 2-11 months of age and 152 730 (54%) were males. Conclusions This data set could identify an improved specific, sensitive set of criteria for diagnosing clin-ical pneumonia and help identify sick children in need of referral to a higher level of care or a change of therapy. Field studies could be designed based on insights from PREPARE analyses to validate a potential revised pneumonia algorithm. The PREPARE methodology can also act as a model for disease database assembly.",0,0,CLINICAL-FEATURES; YOUNG-CHILDREN; INFECTIONS; DIARRHEA; OVERLAP; MALARIA; BURDEN,Article,2.4-S1_患者評論效度研究.csv

Quality improvement studies are needed to assess the representativeness of PRO data collected in routine care, identify the underlying causes of non-response and develop novel methods to ensure data representativeness. Using a multilevel framework and a mixed-methods approach, we have three aims: (1) characterise the non-response of the Global-10 across clinic, provider and patient levels; (2) identify multilevel causes of non-response and potential strategies to improve representativeness in PRO collection; and (3) develop effective modifications to missing-data methods to enhance the representativeness of pre-existing PRO data. Methods and analysis Our primary data source is the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global-10, collected as part of routine care at the Radiation Oncology clinics within the Mass General Brigham (MGB) healthcare system. Other sources include (1) Harvard Catalyst for provider-specific data, (2) MGB administrative data, (3) public Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data and (4) the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System. We will conduct quantitative analyses to assess variations in Global-10 non-response across multilevel factors. Additionally, we will use qualitative interviews with patients and clinical professionals to understand the causes of non-response and to formulate strategies to expand the reach of PRO collection to underrepresented cancer patients, improve their completions and enhance overall data representativeness. Finally, we will integrate implementation science knowledge and findings from the first two aims into missing-data methods to manage non-response in the pre-existing Global-10 data and to evaluate their performance in preserving representativeness. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (24-225).

There are practice guidelines that outline the requirements for the assessment and treatment of adults. Nevertheless, guidelines specifying what constitutes a good quality diagnostic assessment and report and the competencies required to be a specialist assessor are lacking. This can lead to variation in the quality and reliability of adult ADHD assessments. Poor quality assessments may not be accepted as valid indicators of the presence of ADHD by other clinicians or services, resulting in wasteful re-assessments and delays in providing treatment. To address this issue the UK Adult ADHD Network (UKAAN) proposes a quality framework for adult ADHD assessments - the Adult ADHD Assessment Quality Assurance Standard (AQAS). Methods: The co-authors agreed on five questions or themes that then guided the development of a set of consensus statements. An initial draft was reviewed and amended in an iterative process to reach a final consensus. Results: What constitutes a high-quality diagnostic assessment and report was agreed by consensus of the co-authors. The resulting guideline emphasises the need to evaluate impairment, describes core competencies required by the assessor and highlights the importance of linking the diagnosis to an appropriate post-diagnostic discussion. Assessments should be completed in the context of a full psychiatric and neurodevelopmental review, and need good interview skills, using a semi-structured interview with open questioning and probing to elicit real life examples of symptoms and impairments. It is recommended that 2 hours or more is required for an adequate assessment including both the diagnostic assessment and initial post-assessment discussions. Conclusion: The AQAS has been developed as a practical resource to support reliable and valid diagnostic assessments of adult ADHD. It is intended to complement formal training. A secondary objective is to empower patients by providing them with evidence-based information on what to expect from an assessment and assessment report.",0,0,adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; adult ADHD; practice guidelines; diagnostic assessment; quality standard assessment; ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; BRITISH-ASSOCIATION; COVID-19; RECOMMENDATIONS; ADOLESCENTS; MANAGEMENT,Review,2.4-S1_患者評論效度研究.csv

Design: A systematic review was conducted, with literature searches undertaken in five electronic databases. No date limits were applied. Selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were completed by two reviewers independently. A customised data extraction template was used, with risk of bias conducted using the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist. Data were analysed using narrative synthesis. Results: Thirty-four studies met inclusion criteria. Two studies reported internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha ranging from poor (0.43) to good (0.85). For interrater reliability, only four studies reported intraclass correlation, ranging from 0.66 to 0.96 for Braden sum score. Three studies reported convergent validity, with strong associations found between the COMHON Index (r = 0.70), Cubbin-Jackson scale (r = 0.80), and Norton scale (r = 0.77), but contrasting associations with the Waterlow score (r = 0.22 to 0.72). A large majority of studies reported predictive validity (n = 29), with wide variability. Several studies investigated optimal cut-off scores, with the majority indicating this was in the range of 12-14. Conclusions: This review demonstrates inconsistency in the psychometric properties of the Braden scale in ICU settings. Further research is needed to determine suitability of the Braden scale for ICU before it can be recommended as standard for clinical practice, including comparison with other ICU-specific risk assessment tools. Implications for clinical practice: When used in ICU, the reliability, validity and reported cut-off scores of the Braden scale are variable. As a predictive tool, the scale should be used cautiously. In ICU, the value of the Braden scale resides in its ability to identify patients that are most at risk of developing a pressure injury and to implement preventative measures to mitigate identified risk factors.",0,0,Braden scale; Intensive care; Pressure injury; Risk assessment; Systematic review; CRITICALLY-ILL PATIENTS; PREDICTIVE-VALIDITY; ULCER RISK; INTERRATER RELIABILITY; AGREEMENT; ACCURACY; WATERLOW; JACKSON; TRAUMA; SCORES,Review,2.4-S1_患者評論效度研究.csv

Shortening length of stay may reduce costs and improve patient satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of same-day discharge after appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Methods A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. A literature search of EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar was conducted from inception to April 14, 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and selected studies that addressed discharge on the same calendar day as the appendectomy. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool. Main outcomes were hospital readmission, complications, and unplanned hospital visits in the postoperative course. A random effects model was used to pool risk ratios for the main outcomes. Results Of the 1912 articles screened, 17 comparative studies and 8 non-comparative studies met the inclusion criteria. Most only included laparoscopic procedure for uncomplicated appendicitis. Most studies were considered at moderate or serious risk of bias. In meta-analysis, same-day discharge (vs. overnight hospitalization) was not associated with increased rates of readmission, complication, and unplanned hospital visits. Non-comparative studies demonstrated low rates of readmission, complications, and unplanned hospital visits after same-day discharge. Conclusion This study suggests that same-day discharge after laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis is safe without an increased risk of readmission, complications, or unplanned hospital visits. Hence, same-day discharge may be further encouraged in selected patients.",0,0,Appendicitis; Appendectomy; Same-day discharge; Length of stay; Readmission; OUTPATIENT LAPAROSCOPIC APPENDECTOMY; UNCOMPLICATED ACUTE APPENDICITIS; SURGERY; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; FEASIBILITY; EMERGENCIES; CHILDREN; PROTOCOL; SAVINGS,Review,2.4-S4_線上評論平台醫療研究.csv

Objective To identify patient perception instruments in multiprofessional primary care and evaluate their quality. Methods Systematic review using Medline, Pascal, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Scopus, and CAIRN. Eligible articles developed, evaluated, or validated 1 or more self-assessment instruments. The instruments had to measure primary care delivery, patient primary care experiences and assess at least 3 quality-of-care dimensions. The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) checklist was used to assess methodological quality of included studies. Instrument measurement properties were appraised using 3 possible quality scores. Data were combined to provide best-evidence synthesis based on the number of studies, their methodological quality, measurement property appraisal, and result consistency. Subscales used to capture patient primary care experiences were extracted and grouped into the 9 Institute of Medicine dimensions. Results Twenty-nine articles were found. The included instruments captured many subscales illustrating the diverse conceptualization of patient primary care experiences. No included instrument demonstrated adequate validity and the lack of scientific methodology for assessing reliability made interpreting validity questionable.

Yet, distinguishing between genuine and fake reviews poses a significant challenge. This study aims to address the challenges delineated above by developing a reliable and effective fake review detection model leveraging deep learning approaches based on a fake review dataset tailored to the context of Chinese online medical platforms.Methods Inspired by prior research, this paper adopts a crowdsourcing approach to assemble the fake review dataset for Chinese online medical platforms. To develop the fake review detection models, classical machine learning models, along with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Network and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, were applied.Results Our experimental deep learning model exhibited superior performance in identifying fake reviews on online medical platforms, achieving a precision of 98.36% and an F2-Score of 97.97%. Compared to the traditional machine learning models (i.e., logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, ridge regression), this represents an 8.16% enhancement in precision and a 7.7% increase in F2-Score.Conclusion Overall, this study provides a valuable contribution toward the development of an effective fake physician review detection model for online medical platforms.",0,0,Online physician review; physician rating website; online medical review; fake review detection; online fake review; CARE; IMPACT; COMMUNITIES; REPUTATION,Article,2.4-S4_線上評論平台醫療研究.csv

Storytelling methods can privilege Indigenous voices in research. Indigenous people's knowledge systems have existed for millennium, where knowledge is produced and shared through stories. Our collaborative team of Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, and Indigenous Elders, patients, healthcare providers, and administrators, conducted a participatory, scoping review to examine how storytelling has been used as a method in Indigenous health research on Turtle Island (North America), Australia, and Aotearoa (New Zealand). We searched key databases and online sources for qualitative and mixed-methods studies that involved Indigenous participants and used storytelling as a method in health research. Reviewers screened abstracts/full texts to confirm eligibility. Narrative data were extracted and synthesized. An intensive collaboration was woven throughout and included gatherings incorporating Indigenous protocol, Elders' teachings on storytelling, and sharing circles. We included 178 articles and found a diverse array of storytelling approaches and adaptations, along with exemplary practices and problematic omissions. Researchers honoured Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing through careful preparation and community engagement to do storywork, inclusion of Indigenous languages and protocols, and Indigenous initiation and governance. Storytelling centered Indigenous voices, was a culturally relevant and respectful method, involved a healing process, and reclaimed Indigenous stories.

Acute type 2 respiratory failure is also called acute hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF) and characterised by an elevated arterial CO2 level of >6 kPa due to pump failure. Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the most common cause of AHRF. High-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) is a new oxygen delivery system that uses an oxygen-air blender to deliver flow rates of up to 60 L/min. The gas is delivered humidified and heated to the patient via wide-bore nasal cannula. Methods and analysis We hypothesised that HFNC as the initial oxygen administration method will reduce the number of patients with AHRF requiring non-invasive ventilation in patients at 6 hours post intervention when compared with low-flow nasal oxygen (LFO). A randomised single-centre unblinded controlled trial is designed to test our hypothesis. The trial will compare two oxygen administration methods, HFNT versus LFO. Patients will be randomised to one of the two arms if they fulfil the eligibility criteria. The sample size is 82 adult patients (41 HFNT and 41 LFO) presenting to the emergency department. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (REC reference: 20/NI/0049). Dissemination will be achieved in several ways: (1) the findings will be presented at national and international meetings with open-access abstracts online and (2) in accordance with the open-access policies proposed by the leading research funding bodies we aim to publish the findings in high-quality peer-reviewed open-access journals.",0,0,COPD exacerbations; OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; NONINVASIVE VENTILATION; ACUTE EXACERBATIONS; ACIDOSIS; COPD,Article,2.4-1_線上評論研究.csv

Some might induce harsh measures, such as a lockdown. Following a long, harsh lockdown, the recession forces policymakers to rethink reopening. To provide an effective strategy, here we propose a control strategy model. Our model assesses the trade-off between social performance and limited medical resources by determining individuals' propensities. The proposed strategy also helps decision-makers to find optimal lockdown and exit strategies for each region. Moreover, the financial loss is minimized. We use the public sentiment information during the pandemic to determine the percentage of individuals with high-risk behavior and the percentage of individuals with low-risk behavior. Hence, we propose an online platform using fear-sentiment information to estimate the personal protective equipment (PPE) burn rate overtime for the entire population. In addition, a study of a COVID-19 dataset for Los Angeles County is performed to validate our model and its results. The total social cost reduces by 18% compared with a control strategy where susceptible individuals are assumed to be homogeneous.

The process becomes laborious when the annotation is done manually for the availability of a large number of text corpora. Hence, future automated extraction systems will be essential for groups of experts such as doctors and medical practitioners as well as non-experts such as patients, to ensure enhanced clinical decision-making for improving healthcare systems. Such extraction systems can be developed using medical concepts and concept-related features as the part of a structured corpus. The latter can assist in assigning the category and sentiment to each of the medical concepts and their lexical contexts. These categories and sentiment assignments constitute semantic relations of medical concepts, with their context, represented by sentences of the corpus. This paper presents a new domain-based knowledge lexicon coupled with a machine learning approach to extract semantic relations. This is done by assigning category and sentiment of the medical concepts and contexts. The categories considered in this research, are diseases, symptoms, drugs, human_anatomy, and miscellaneous medical terms, whereas sentiments are considered as positive and negative. The proposed assignment systems are developed on the top of WordNet of Medical Event (WME) lexicon. The developed lexicon provides medical concepts and their features, namely Parts-Of-Speech (POS), gloss (descriptive explanation), Similar Sentiment Words (SSW), affinity score, gravity score, polarity score, and sentiment. Several well-known supervised classifiers, including Na < ve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and support vector-based Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) have been applied to evaluate the developed systems. The proposed approaches have resulted in a concepts clustering application by identifying the semantic relations of concepts. The application provides potential exploitation in several domains, such as medical ontologies and recommendation systems.",0,0,Bio-NLP; Category; Medical concept; Medical context; Semantic; Sentiment; HYBRID APPROACH; TEXT; CLASSIFICATION; CHALLENGES; ASSERTIONS,Article,2.4-S3_情感分析醫療領域.csv

While the intricacies of diagnosis and interventions for GD intertwine with diverse socio-cultural challenges, a notable dearth of knowledge exists about the experiences of transgender (TG) individuals during their formative years in Turkey. This study aims to unveil these experiences, shedding light on the challenges, perspectives, and implications in health care settings.Patients and Methods: Our study encompassed 125 participants: 62 TGs under clinical follow-up, and a control group of 63 cisgender individuals. Surveys tailored to TG participants addressed early GD experiences, gender-typed activity participation, and psychosocial challenges from childhood through adolescence. Additionally, both cohorts contributed to a survey on attitudes towards community-based interventions, allowing for a comparative analysis of their perspectives.Results: TGs identified their GD around age 10.77. Female-to-male TGs showed more involvement in traditionally male-associated activities, whereas male-to-female engaged more in female-associated domestic role-plays (p<0.001). Over a third (37.09%) faced ostracization or bullying due to GD, 45.16% encountered verbal abuse, and 12.90% reported physical violence. Additionally, 40.32% had undergone treatment for depression and anxiety disorders. Most participants supported awareness initiatives, advocating for open gender expression, and normalizing the experiences of TG youth. Furthermore, 88.71% of TGs emphasized the importance of enhancing the expertise of professional groups, such as medical and mental health practitioners, in GD matters, a sentiment echoed by 68.25% of cisgender participants (p=0.030). While medical interventions were the least favored strategy at 32.80% overall, 46.78% of TGs supported it, compared to 19.05% of controls (p=0.010).Conclusion: Our study underscores the challenges faced by TG individuals during development. Early recognition, societal awareness, enhanced training in professional healthcare environments, and comprehensive support are crucial for fostering acceptance and reducing adversity among children and adolescents navigating GD.",0,0,gender dysphoria; mental health; health care; childhood play behaviors; psychosocial challenges; early interventions; MENTAL-HEALTH; CLINICAL MANAGEMENT; TRANSGENDER YOUTH; SOCIAL SUPPORT; CHILDREN; ADOLESCENTS; BEHAVIOR; ISSUES; GIRLS; GAY,Article,2.4-S3_情感分析醫療領域.csv

Manifested by earlier studies, sentiment analysis of drug reviews has a large potential for providing valuable insights to assist healthcare professionals and companies for evaluating the safety of drugs after it has been marketed. Such insights help safeguard patients and increase their trust in medical companies. The existing systems either follow a lexicon-based approach or a learning-based approach for sentiment analysis in the medical domain. Learning-based techniques require annotated data while lexicon-based techniques tend to be domain-specific which restricts their wide use. This research embarks on a hybrid technique that utilizes both learning-based and lexicon-based approaches to achieve better results. General-purpose sentiment lexicons, such as AFFIN, TextBlob, and VADER, are used for annotating the reviews. Furthermore, several feature engineering techniques, such as term frequency (TF), term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), and union of TF and TF-IDF (TF U TF-IDF) have been incorporated for the extraction of useful features. Finally, the learning models including logistic regression (LR), AdaBoost classifier (AB), random forest (RF), extra tree classifier (ETC), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are used to classify sentiments of the reviews. The performance of the proposed hybrid approach is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experimental results indicate that the combination of learning-based and lexicon-based approaches provide improved results than their individual use. Moreover, TextBlob has shown promising results giving an accuracy of 96% with MLP when used with TF-IDF and with LR when used with TF U TF-IDF.",0,0,Drugs; Sentiment analysis; Feature extraction; Support vector machines; Medical services; Social networking (online); Object oriented modeling; drug reviews evaluation; TextBlob; AFFIN; review classification; TF-IDF; VADER; deep learning; SENTIMENT ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION,Review,2.4-S3_情感分析醫療領域.csv

Although various educational models aim to increase interest in general practice, effective interventions are limited. The reasons for this low appeal among medical graduates remain unclear.MethodsThis cross-sectional study surveyed medical students' and residents' attitudes towards general practice in Tyrol, Austria. The online questionnaire addressed professional values, general practice-related issues, personal professional intentions, and demographics. Data analysis employed chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression to explore predictors of interest in general practice.ResultsThe study included 528 students and 103 residents. Key values identified were stable positions, assured income, and work-family reconciliation. General practice was recognised for long-term patient relationships and patient contact, with students attributing more positive work-environmental characteristics and higher reputation to it than residents. Few participants (students: 3.2%, residents: 11.7%) had opted for general practice; about half were considering it as career option. Reasons not to choose general practice were preferences for other specialties, intrinsic characteristics of general practice, workload, insufficient time for the patients, financial pressures, low reputation, and perceived mediocre training quality. Predictors of interest in general practice included perception of independent decision-making, importance of work-family balance (students), better practical experiences in general practice during medical school (students and residents), younger age, and perceiving general practice as offering a promising future (residents). Both groups felt underprepared by medical school and/or general practice training for general practice roles. The attractiveness of specialist medicine over general practice was related to clearer content boundaries, better career opportunities, and higher incomes.ConclusionsAccording to these results, measures to improve attractiveness of general practice should focus on (i) high-quality undergraduate education including practical experiences, and (ii) on ensuring professional autonomy, work-family reconciliation, and job stability.

Method A cross-sectional study comprising medical students from 5-year and 8-year program was conducted online. Demographics, specialty preferences and influencing factors, and career planning situations were collected and analysed by the chi-square test. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed in each program to identify the association between influencing factors and each specialty. Results A total of 128 students (57.03% 5-year, 42.97% 8-year) responded to our survey. More 8-year students had a doctor in their household than 5-year students (25.45% vs. 10.96%, p < 0.05). The most preferred specialty among 5-year students was surgery, followed by others and internal medicine, while that most preferred by 8-year students was surgery, followed by internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology and anesthesiology. Compared with 5-year students, more 8-year students considered 'personal competencies' (66.67% vs. 40.85%, p < 0.05), 'the reputation of the specialty' (18.52% vs. 7.04%, p <= 0.05), 'fewer doctor.patient disputes' (27.78% vs. 11.27%, p < 0.05) and 'advice from family members' (24.07% vs. 7.04%, p < 0.05) influential. Among 5-year students, 'personal competencies' was positively associated with preference for surgery and ' work-life balance' was negatively associated. Among 8-year students, 'personal competencies' and 'work-life balance' were positively associated with internal medicine, while 'interests in the specialty' and 'broad career prospects' were negatively related. Many students need further career guidance, and personalized tutoring was the most wanted method. Conclusions There was no difference between 5-year and 8-year students regarding specialty preference, but bias existed, possibly due to the influence of the real-world situation. Improving the working environment and welfare might be beneficial for developing a balanced distribution of the workforce among different medical departments.

Moreover, potential causes of Chinese physicians' disrepute have been outlined.MethodsPrimary data were collected through a cross-sectional online survey of physicians from 10 provinces in China, who were invited to complete an anonymous survey from December 2018 to January 2019. A total of 842 physicians (effective response rate: 92.22%) were recruited as participants.ResultsAbout 83% of the participants self-perceived professional reputation damage from the sense of the public opinion concept. Approach half of participants exhibited the idea of turnover intention (47.3%) and one or more symptoms of burnout (46.4%). About 74.9% of the participants experienced a degree of stress. Additionally, three out of five participants reported low-level subjective well-being. More than 70% of the participants disapproved of their offspring becoming a physician. Four factors leading to physicians' damaged professional reputations are those addressed: conflict transfer, cognitive bias, improper management, and individual deviance. Stigmatised physicians are more likely to practice high-frequent defensive medicine (beta =0.172, P <0.001), intend to leave the profession (<beta>=0.240, P <0.001), disapprove of their children becoming physicians (<beta>=0.332, P<0.001) and yield worse levels of workplace well-being, including high levels of perceived stress (<beta>=0.214, P <0.001), increasing burnout (<beta>=0.209, P <0.001), and declining sense of well-being (<beta>=-0.311, P<0.001).ConclusionChinese physicians were aware of damaged professional reputations from the sense of the public opinion concept, which contributes to increasing withdrawal behaviors and decreasing workplace well-being-a worsening trend threatening the entire health system.

In addition, patients were requested to rate the significance of 22 surgeon-related factors, on a scale of 1 (Not Important At All) to 5 (Very Important), in choosing their arthroplasty surgeon.ResultsOf the 3522 patients that received the survey, 538 patients responded (15.3%). The most common referral sources were physician referral (50.2%), family/friend referral (27.7%), and self-guided research (24.5%). Of those that were referred by a physician, 54.4% of respondents were referred by another orthopaedic provider. Patients rated board certification (4.72 +/- 0.65), in-network insurance status (4.66 +/- 0.71), fellowship training (4.50 +/- 0.81), bedside manner/personality (4.32 +/- 0.86), and facility appearance (4.26 +/- 0.81) as the five most important factors in picking an arthroplasty surgeon. Television (1.42 +/- 0.83), print (1.50 +/- 0.88), and online (1.58 +/- 0.93) advertisements, along with social media presence (1.83 +/- 1.08), and practice group size (2.97 +/- 1.13) were rated as the five least important factors.ConclusionPatients are most likely to select an arthroplasty surgeon based on referral from other physicians, namely orthopedic surgeons, in addition to board certification status, in-network insurance, and fellowship training. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of physician credentials and reputation within the orthopaedic community in order to attract and retain patients.",0,0,Hip arthroplasty; Knee arthroplasty; Surgeon selection; Patient preferences; CHOICE,Article,2.4-S5_線上聲譽與患者選擇.csv

Therefore, online reviews are the part of everyday life and millions of online reviews being generated daily; unfortunately, all online reviews are not genuine do happen negative reviews written by malicious users are everywhere on the social media platform such as Google, Yelp, Facebook, TripAdvisor, Amazon, Healthgrades, etc. Every fake, spam, and negative online review can directly impact a potential customer's purchasing decision, company's reputation, profitability and misleading the consumers, and damage the reputation of review websites. Hence, detecting fake online reviews has become a big challenge in the rapid development of e-commerce but it can be more dangerous when it comes to medical products, e-healthcare platforms to classify online reviews correctly due to the high false-positive rate (FPR) and the false-negative rate (FNR). In the medical environment, trust is the best reason to pursue transparency and deserve their confidence then patients have made online reviews an integral part of their decision-making process. Patient online reviews and ratings can be a good indicator of clinical effectiveness, efficiently control their health and patient safety. Researchers performed various investigations to predict fake online reviews, and their models could have provided low prediction accuracy due to the selection of lesser features and lack of essential prediction labels. To handle this issue, this paper presents an efficient approach to specifically predict fake online reviews with multiple feature analyses in an automated way with different perspectives of patient safety using qualitative methods. The primary aim of this paper is to provide a solid and complete comparative study of present research on detecting fake online reviews designed a deep learning index system to examine multiple features such as sentiment, test, and behaviour features of the online reviewers. The input samples are trained with the novel dense network model to extract essential features. And the labels are provided tentatively, and the model adopts some initial samples to train the proposed classifier model as the model intends to give better accuracy. The model's novelty relies on the feature selection and label classification of reviews. The experimental results indicated that fake review detection yields better accuracy of 99.5% on the anticipated model than other baseline approaches across the Amazon and medical datasets, using deep learning techniques to reduce the FPR, and FNR then improves fake review detection capabilities. The proposed model significantly improved the classifier's performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques in the Amazon and medical domains, demonstrating the effectiveness and relevance of the method.",0,0,Fake review detection; Deep learning; Automated model; Fake reviews; Medical reviews; Patient reviews; Classification,Article,2.4-S5_線上聲譽與患者選擇.csv

Understanding the relationships between individuals' decisions, their decision- making styles, and personality traits may explain why people respond differently to post-disaster situations and bring us a better understanding of how people would react after a disaster. Using data from an online survey with 536 responses among residents of Tehran, this study performed multiple linear regression analyses to explore the relations between personality and decision-making styles with the preference for self-presentation to hospitals and the factors influencing their choices of hospitals after a disaster. The results showed that 36.2% of the participants preferred self-presentation, and 47.4% reported that their primary reason for choosing self-presentation over calling an ambulance was fear of losing the injured. 89.5% believed that earthquake in Tehran is dangerous. The most influential factor in respondents' choice of hospital was ""Less distant,"" chosen by 81.5%. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between preference for self-presentation and risk perception. Among the influence of hospital selection factors, multiple regression analysis showed a positive prediction of proximity by neuroticism; reputation, services, and accessibility by affective decision-making; and reputation and accessibility by rational decision-making. These results highlighted the importance of individual differences in reacting to extreme conditions after a disaster and provided important information about the predictors of post-disaster decisions. These results could be used in quantitative models to predict post-disaster demands for each hospital, demands for roads heading to it, and patients' waiting time.",0,0,Post-disaster behavior; Hospital selection; Self-presentation; Risk perception; Big five personality traits; Dual-type models; RISK PERCEPTION; AGE; INFORMATION; EXPERIENCE; HOSPITALS; TASK,Article,2.4-S5_線上聲譽與患者選擇.csv

Despite its potential benefits, its application in the context of TKA in Iran is in its early stages, lacking comprehensive studies on feasibility, acceptance and programme adherence. This article outlines a protocol for an open-label, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial investigating the impact of a 4 week telerehabilitation programme alongside usual care. Methods Thirty patients (aged 50-90) undergoing TKA for severe Knee Osteoarthritis at Atiyeh Hospital in Tehran, Iran, will be recruited using block randomisation. Participants will be assigned to either the intervention group, receiving telerehabilitation or the control group without telerehabilitation. The intervention will include virtual physiotherapy sessions thrice weekly, lasting 30-45 min each, over 4 weeks. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of telerehabilitation, measured through recruitment and attrition rates, questionnaire completion rates, patient satisfaction using appropriate questionnaire and adherence to the intervention. Secondary outcomes encompass four Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaire subscales (function in Activities of Daily Living, Pain, Symptoms, Quality of Life). Patient global assessment will use a standardised question. An online survey will evaluate walking assistant device usage, exercise adherence and adverse events. The number of individuals receiving in-person rehabilitation will be documented after the first postoperative surgeon visit. Assessments occur at baseline and 4 weeks postsurgery. Analysis Statistical analysis, including independent samples t-test, paired samples t-test, chi 2 test, Fisher's exact test, analysis of covariance and multiple linear regression, will use SPSS software version 16, with significance set at p<0.05.

Little information is known regarding the risks and outcomes of cosmetic tourism, in particular, for aesthetic breast surgery. The majority of the literature involves retrospective case series with no defined comparator. We aimed to amalgamate the published data to date to ascertain the risks involved and the outcomes of cosmetic tourism for aesthetic breast surgery on a global basis. Methods A systematic review of PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and OVID Medline was conducted using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. Keywords such as ""medical tourism"", ""cosmetic tourism"", ""tourism"", ""tourist"", ""surgery"", ""breast"" and ""outcomes"" were used. Seven hundred and seventy-one titles were screened, and 86 abstracts were reviewed leaving 35 full texts. Twenty-four of these met the inclusion criteria and were used to extract data for this systematic review. Results One hundred and seventy-one patients partook in cosmetic tourism for aesthetic breast surgery. Forty-nine percent of patients had an implant-based procedure. Other procedures included: mastopexy (n=4), bilateral breast reduction (n=11) and silicone injections (n=2). Two-hundred and twenty-two complications were recorded, common complications included: wound infection in 39% (n=67), breast abscess/ collection in 12% (n=21), wound dehiscence in 12% (n= 20) and ruptured implant in 8% (n=13). Clavien-Dindo classification of the complications includes 88 (51%) IIIb complications with 103 returns to theatre, 2 class IV complications (ICU stay) and one class V death of a patient. Explantation occurred in 39% (n=32) of implant-based augmentation patients. Conclusions Aesthetic breast surgery tourism is popular within the cosmetic tourism industry. However, with infective complications (39%) and return to theatre rates (51%) significantly higher than expected, it is clear that having these procedures abroad significantly increases the risks involved. The high complication rate not only impacts individual patients, but also the home country healthcare systems. Professional bodies for cosmetic surgery in each country must highlight and educate patients how to lower this risk if they do choose to have cosmetic surgery abroad. In this current era of an intra-pandemic world where health care is already stretched, the burden from cosmetic tourism complications must be minimised.",0,0,Medical tourism; Breast surgery; Aesthetic surgery; COSMETIC TOURISM; COST-ANALYSIS; COMPLICATIONS; INFECTIONS; MANAGEMENT,Review,2.4-1_線上評論研究.csv

In this study, a dataset of Arabic COVID-19 related tweets was collected, which fell in the period of the curfew. The dataset was processed, based on several machine learning predictive models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes (NB), along with the N-gram feature extraction technique. The results show that applying the SVM classifier along with bigram in Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) outperformed other models with an accuracy of 85%. The results of awareness prediction showed that the south region observed the highest level of awareness towards COVID-19 containment measures, whereas the middle region was the least. The proposed model can support the medical sectors and decision-makers to decide the appropriate procedures for each region based on their attitudes towards the pandemic.",0,0,Arabic sentiment analysis; machine learning; support vector machine; K-nearest neighbor; naive bayes; N-gram; natural language processing; Twitter,Article,2.4-S3_情感分析醫療領域.csv
