There is a scarcity of data regarding the proportion, healthcare utilisation and costs of patients with uncontrolled severe asthma in Asia. This study aimed to plug the knowledge gap in this area. Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients with asthma managed in our respiratory specialist clinic were evaluated prospectively. Healthcare utilisation comprising unscheduled asthma-related primary care visits, emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions were obtained from the national health records system. We defined uncontrolled severe asthma as poor symptom control (Asthma Control Test score <20); 2 or more asthma exacerbations requiring >= 3 days of systemic corticosteroids in the previous year; 1 or more serious asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalisation in the previous year; or airflow limitation with pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEND <80% predicted despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids and another controller medication. Results: Of the 423 study participants, 49 (11.6%) had uncontrolled severe asthma. Compared to non-severe asthma, patients with uncontrolled severe asthma were older and more likely to be female and obese. They had a median of 2 (interquarfile range: 0 to 3) exacerbations a year, with 51% having >= 2 exacerbations in the past 12 months. They were responsible for 43.9% of the hospital admissions experienced by the whole study cohort. Mean annual direct asthma costs per patient was S$2952 +/- S$4225 in uncontrolled severe asthma vs S$841 +/- S$815 in non severe asthma. Conclusion: Approximately 12% of patients with asthma managed in a hospital-based respiratory specialist clinic in Singapore have uncontrolled severe asthma. They account for a disproportionate amount of healthcare utilisation and costs. Healthcare strategies targeting these patients are urgently needed.",15,0,Cost; Exacerbations; Singapore; DIFFICULT; COSTS; IDENTIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVALENCE; BURDEN; TRENDS; COHORT; UK,Article

This mixed methods systematic review assessed the effects of trauma-informed approaches on psychological, behavioural, and health outcomes in health-care providers and adult patients in primary care and community mental healthcare. We searched five databases and grey literature and consulted experts for reports published in January 1990 to June 2021. The quantitative descriptive and qualitative framework syntheses were integrated through a line of argument and mapped onto a logic model. We included six nonrandomised studies that evaluated eight interventions with varied theoretical developments, components, and outcomes. The most common components were budget allocation, workforce development, identification/response to violence and trauma, and evaluation. Evidence for intervention effects was limited and conflicting. Four studies reported improvement in provider readiness and sense of community, while three reported conflicting effects on provider behaviour regarding delivery of trauma-informed care. Four studies reported some improvement in patient readiness for disease management and access to services; however, the evidence for patient satisfaction was conflicting. Two studies found that patients and providers felt safe. While one study reported improvement in patient quality of life and chronic pain, another found no effect on substance use, and three studies reported conflicting effects on mental health. Intervention mechanisms included a package of varied components, tailoring to the organisational needs, capacities and preferences, staff education and self-care, creating safe environments, and shared decision-making. Intervention effects were moderated by contextual (health system values, policies, governance, business models, trauma-informed movement, organisational culture, and social determinants of health) and intervention factors (buy-in from all staff, collective learning through conversations, equal attention to staff and patient well-being, and sustainable funding). No studies measured adverse events/harm, cost effectiveness, or providers' health. We need more methodologically robust evaluations of trauma-informed organisational change interventions.",12,0,COOCCURRING DISORDERS; WOMEN; FRAMEWORK; OUTCOMES,Article

We used nationwide, population-based data to examine the influence of care coordination on 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs for heart failure (HF).STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 20,713 patients with HF 18 years or older discharged from hospitals in 2016 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The coordination of care among a patient's outpatient physicians was measured with care density.METHODS: Multilevel regression models were used after adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics to explore the impact of care density on 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs.RESULTS: Patients with high care coordination had lower odds of 30-day readmission (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98) and mortality (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.99) and lower costs (cost ratio [CR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.90) compared with those with low care coordination. Patients with medium care coordination had lower costs (CR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.98) than those with low care coordination. CONCLUSIONS: High care coordination is associated with decreased 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs for HF. Enhancing coordination of care has the potential to increase the value of care. It is important to monitor coordination of care and develop strategies to maintain high levels of care coordination for HF.",1,0,PROFILING HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE; QUALITY-OF-CARE; AFTER-DISCHARGE; OUTCOMES; CONTINUITY; RATES; ASSOCIATION; DEATH,Article

This prospective cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of mCRC between March 2015 and May 2020. QoL was evaluated before treatment and at 6 months and 1 year posttreatment. All related variables were controlled using the inverse probability of treatment weighting method. Generalized estimating equations with the differencein-difference method was used to explore changes in QoL. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of the two groups was simulated using the annual-cycle Markov decision tree model. Finally, 39 and 76 patients were included in the targeted and nontargeted agent groups, respectively. At 6 months after treatment, QoL of the two groups improved significantly, but the targeted agent group had significantly better QoL than did the nontargeted agent group at 1 year posttreatment (P < 0.05). When the time frame was set to 20 years, the ICUR of the targeted agent group compared with the nontargeted agent group was US$32,052 per quality-adjusted life years. Addition of a targeted drug to the second-line mFOLOFX6 regimen not only improved the patients' QoL but was also more cost effective when the willingness-to-pay threshold was set at US$33,004 (the per capita gross domestic product of Taiwan).

This implies that families are affected, causing tremendous physical, psychological, and economic pressures and burdens on the caregivers and families of the patient. The estimated social cost of caring for dementia families increased from $1.3 trillion in 2019 to $2.8 trillion in 2030 (World Health Organisation, 2021). Thus, long-term care for the dementia population has become a critical issue in medical care and social services in Taiwan and worldwide. In 2017, Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare has been starting Dementia care policy with 10 years long-term care plan through set up dementia care centre. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of dementia care centre for reducing the burden and improving the quality of life for caregivers of dementia patients. This pilot study adopts a quasi-experimental research design and uses purposive sampling to select in house informal caregivers of dementia patients who are part of a dementia collaborative care programme at a medical centre in the northern region and were willing to participate in this study. Upon enrolment in the study, subjects were given a pre-test, followed by a one-hour face-to-face nursing consultation and assessment after 2 weeks. Subsequently, a telephone nursing consultation was conducted once a month for 3 months. Two weeks after completing all counselling sessions, a post-test was administered to measure the caregiver burden with The Chinese version of the Caregiver Burden Inventory and the quality of life for caregivers with The 'Chinese Health Questionnaire CHQ-12'. After providing case management and nursing counselling, the total caregiver burden score significantly decreased from an average of 40.1 (SD = 21.6) at the pre-test to an average of 38.6 (SD = 21.4) at the post-test, reaching statistical significance (p < 0.01). The results of this study showed that providing dementia caregivers with case management and nursing consultation services helps improve the overall caregiver burden (particularly emotional burden and physical burden) as well as the health questionnaire scores. However, the social burden and time burden did not improve after receiving case management and counselling among caregivers; instead, post-test scores of these aspects were significantly higher.",0,0,caregiver burden; case management; dementia; nursing counselling; BURDEN,Article

However, a major challenge lies in the strong separation of healthcare structures, which hinders efficient interprofessional and intersectoral communication and collaboration. The mandatory nationwide implementation of the telematics infrastructure may offer a solution to enhance healthcare professionals' communication and collaboration.Objective Our study aims to elicit participants' perceptions of and attitudes towards the implementation and usage of the telematics infrastructure in fostering interprofessional communication and collaboration between home-care nursing services and general practitioner practices.Methods We conducted interviews with seven members of general practitioner practices and 10 in home-care nursing services. Using thematic content analysis, we identified five themes, of which four along with 10 subthemes were integrated into Greenhalgh et al.'s 'nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread and sustainability' framework.Results Participants recognised the potential of digital technology to enhance interprofessional communication and collaboration. However, this potential largely depended on individual healthcare actors' willingness to seek information, invest and adapt. Attitudes towards the telematics infrastructure varied widely from hopeful confidence to outright rejection. Home-care nursing services generally viewed the telematics infrastructure with optimism, while general practitioners expressed reservations, particularly due to technological disruptions, lack of user-friendliness, and organisational structures.Conclusion Our findings highlight the potential of digital technology to enhance interprofessional communication. Successful implementation of technological innovations, however, goes beyond technological aspects and involves social, political and organisational processes. Future implementation strategies for such innovations in healthcare should involve users early and ensure clear communication.",0,0,Nurses; general practitioner; communication; collaboration; ambulant care; health telematics; eHealth strategy; INTERPROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT,Article

The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment used this opportunity to conduct the first randomized controlled study of a public insurance expansion. This analysis builds off of previous work by comparing rural and urban survey outcomes and adds qualitative interviews with 86 rural study participants for context. We examine health care access and use, personal finances, and self-reported health. While urban and rural populations have unique demographic profiles, rural populations appear to have benefited from Medicaid as much as urban.

Therefore, this article carries out a systematic review using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta -Analysis) to draw inferences and generate evidences with respect to the influence of cash transfers on two aspects of human capital outcomes of children, viz., child health and nutrition, and educational outcomes in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Forty four studies were selected on the basis of a four-stage procedure that checked for identification, screening, eligi-bility and inclusion. The results indicate that majority of cash transfers based on conditionalities, like mandatory attendance in healthcare organisations and educational institutions, proved to be effective in the selected countries. While 7 studies (16%) showed no changes in the outcomes, 5 (11%) depicted negative impact and the rest (73%) presented a positive result. The selected studies suggest that a strong supply-side mechanism in place in LMICs, ensure functional and quality services at health centres and schools in the respective regions and reflect overwhelming outcomes. Furthermore, incentive design, anticipated termination, and supply-side interventions would be instrumental in avoiding a crisis or shock in the economic sense to recipient households.",0,0,Cash transfers; Education; Child health; Malnutrition; Systematic review; Low; and middle -income countries; TRANSFER PROGRAM; SCHOOL ENROLLMENT; INFANT-MORTALITY; IMPACT; HEALTH; MEXICO; MALNUTRITION; HOUSEHOLD; NUTRITION; COUNTRIES,Review
Determinants of rural-urban differential in healthcare utilization among the elderly population in India,"Banerjee, Shreya; BMC; Banerjee, Shreya; Banerjee, Shreya; Banerjee, Shreya",2021,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,10.1186/s12889-021-10773-1,WOS:000656207000014,India,"BackgroundPopulation aging poses a demographic burden on a country such as India with inadequate social security systems and very low public investment in health sector. This challenge of accelerated demographic transition is coupled by the rural-urban disparity in access to healthcare services among the elderly people in India. An important objective of India's National Health Policy (2017) is to ""progressively achieve universal health coverage"" which is posited upon mitigating the sub-national disparity that necessitates identifying the drivers of the disparity for targeted policy intervention. This study, therefore, makes an attempt towards the exploration of the prominent contributory factors behind the rural-urban gap in utilisation of healthcare among the older population in India.MethodsThe analysis has been done by using the unit level data of Social Consumption: Health (Schedule number 25.0) of the 75th round of the National sample Survey conducted during July 2017-June 2018. Two binary logistic models have been proposed to capture the crude and the adjusted association between health seeking behaviour and place of residence (rural/ urban). To compute the group differences (between rural and urban) in the rate of healthcare utilization among the elderly population in India and to decompose these differences into the major contributing factors, Fairlie's decomposition method has been employed.ResultsThe logistic regression models established a strong association between place of residence and likelihood of healthcare utilisation among the Indian elderly people. The results of the Fairlie's decomposition analysis revealed considerable rural-urban inequality disfavouring the rural residents and health care utilisation was found to be 7 percentage points higher among the older population residing in urban India than their rural counterparts. Level of education and economic status, both of which are indicators of a person's Socio-Economic Status, were the two major determinants of the existing rural-urban differential in healthcare utilisation, together explaining 41% of the existing rural-urban differential.ConclusionPublic health care provisions need to be strengthened both in terms of quality and outreach by way of greater public investments in the health sector and by building advanced health infrastructure in the rural areas. Implementation of poverty alleviation programmes and ensuring social-security of the elderly are also indispensable in bringing about equity in healthcare utilisation.",0,0,Rural-urban disparity; Elderly population; Health inequality; Decomposition analysis; Demographic burden; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; MORBIDITY; INEQUALITIES; EXPENDITURE; GENDER; EQUITY; LIFE,Article

However, knowledge on the system-wide effectiveness of these reforms is limited. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the reforms' health and health system impacts. In 13 August 2022, international databases and three Chinese databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies and controlled before-after studies. Included studies assessed large-scale PHC policies since 2009; had a temporal comparator and a control group and assessed impacts on expenditures, utilization, care quality and health outcomes. Study quality was assessed using Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions, and results were synthesized narratively. From 49 174 identified records, 42 studies were included-all with quasi-experimental designs, except for one randomized control trial. Nine studies were assessed as at low risk of bias. Only five low- to moderate-quality studies assessed the comprehensive reforms as a whole and found associated increases in health service utilization, whilst the other 37 studies examined single-component policies. The National Essential Medicine Policy (N = 15) and financing reforms (N = 11) were the most studied policies, whilst policies on primary care provision (i.e. family physician policy and the National Essential Public Health Services) were poorly evaluated. The PHC reforms were associated with increased primary care utilization (N = 17) and improved health outcomes in people with non-communicable diseases (N = 8). Evidence on healthcare costs was unclear, and impacts on patients' financial burden and care quality were understudied. Some studies showed disadvantaged regions and groups that accrued greater benefits (N = 8). China's comprehensive PHC reforms have made some progress in achieving their policy objectives including increasing primary care utilization, improving some health outcomes and reducing health inequalities.

In Cameroon, it is very common to find medically discharged patients who have received surgical treatment and are unable to pay the resulting bills. These patients can be held in detention in hospitals until payments are complete. Even the corpses of patients who die with unpaid medical bills can be withheld until their family members pay off the debt. While this practice has been ongoing for many y, there remains very little scholarship on the issue reported in the literature. The main objective of this study was to uncover the lived experiences of discharged patients residing in hospital detention for being unable to pay their medical bills.Methods: In-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and observations were conducted with purposefully selected patients living in detention in 2 rural private hospitals in the Fundong Health District in Cameroon. A thematic framework technique was used to analyze the transcribed data. The study was ethically approved by the Cameroon Bioethics Initiative, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.Results: Living in hospital detention after receiving treatment constitutes an economic, social, and psychological burden for patients. Economically, it exacerbated poverty for the patients unable to purchase food, medications, and clothing due to lack of jobs and financial support. Socially, many of these individuals suffered from isolation, loneliness, shame, stigma, risk of contracting other diseases, and precarious sleeping conditions. The psychological burden was comprised of stress, depression, trauma, nightmares, and suicidal thoughts. Conclusions: The experiences of discharged patients in hospital detention suggest that they live in very deplorable conditions. There is a need for a functional healthcare protection mechanism, such as universal health coverage, to reduce the cost of healthcare services and surgical operations. Alternative payment mechanisms should also be considered. (C) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Breast cancer in Thailand: policy and health system challenges to universal healthcare,"Lakha, Fatim; Suriyawongpaisul, Paibul; Sangrajrang, Suleeporn; Leerapan, Borwornsom; Coker, Richard; OXFORD UNIV PRESS; Lakha, Fatim; Coker, Richard; Suriyawongpaisul, Paibul; Leerapan, Borwornsom; Sangrajrang, Suleeporn; Lakha, Fatim; Leerapan, Borwornsom; Lakha, Fatim",2020,HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING,10.1093/heapol/czaa063,WOS:000615925000003,England; Thailand,"Thailand has successfully implemented Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and embedded the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into its Thailand 4.0 policy. Breast cancer is a growing challenge in Thailand, as it is globally. It serves as a perfect medium through which to interrogate UHC and demonstrate areas of the health system which require further strengthening if UHC is to be sustainable in the longer term. We conducted a situation analysis and used a Systemic Rapid Assessment (SYSRA) framework to examine the challenges posed to UHC through the lens of breast cancer. We identified a number of challenges facing UHC including (1) continued political commitment; (2) the need for coordinated scale-up of strategic investments involving increased financing and fine-tuning of the allocation of resources according to health needs; (3) reducing inequities between health insurance schemes; (4) investing in innovation of technologies, and more critically, in technology transfer and capacity building; (5) increasing capacity, quality and confidence in the whole primary healthcare team but especially family medicine doctors. This would subsequently increase both efficiency and effectiveness of the patient pathway, as well as allow patients wherever possible to be treated close to their homes, work and family; (6) developing and connecting information systems to facilitate understanding of what is working, where needs are and track trends to monitor improvements in patient care. Our findings add to an existing body of evidence which suggest, in light of changing disease burden and increasing costs of care, a need for broader health system reforms to create a more enabling platform for integrated healthcare as opposed to addressing individual challenging elements one vertical system at a time. As low- and middle-income countries look to realize the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable UHC this analysis may provide input for policy discussion at national, regional and community levels and have applicability beyond breast cancer services alone and beyond Thailand.",0,0,Health system strengthening; universal healthcare; breast cancer; equity; challenges; MENTAL-HEALTH; SCALING-UP; COVERAGE; COUNTRIES; SURVIVAL; EXPERIENCE; MORTALITY; PAYMENTS,Article

Objectives This study looks at the primary care attributes of AAMC from a patient perspective, to assess their features, strengths and weaknesses. Methods Using a primary care survey tool, a cross-sectional survey of 360 users was conducted at 18 facilities across 9 districts of Delhi to gather information on six dimensions of primary care delivery. Thematic analysis of responses to quantitative, multiple-choice and Likert scale questions using percentage of respondents in each category; and a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and suggestions (SWOS) framework, was used to examine the primary care attributes. Results AAMCs have done well in improving proximity, availability, physical and financial access to primary care with respondents reporting their residence within 1 kilometre of AAMCs (95%), physician being available (100%), free drugs in stock (99%). Service delivery is however not comprehensive with missing preventive care. Respondents reported missing gatekeeping, weak referral mechanism (6-19%), and low physician's familiarity with their overall health (2%). Conclusion AAMCs have brought affordable healthcare with free medicines and diagnostics to neighbourhood. There is an opportunity for attaining universal healthcare that is responsive to user needs through provision of comprehensive care. Compulsory enrolment of neighbourhood population with an electronic database of patients has an immense potential to improve longitudinality and coordination of care.",0,0,access to care; continuity of care; health services research; primary care; quality of care; qualitative research; PHYSICIAN; COMMUNITY; TIME,Article

Youth suicide rates declined gradually over the past two decades, but it is alarming to see that self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and attempts are quite common among junior secondary students. Local studies identify psychopathology (especially depression) and family relationship issues as the most common risk factors of suicide and self-harm, and impulsive control issues are an additional factor contributing to self-harm. In the second part, this paper reviews the evidence for six types of universal and selective prevention strategies identified from local and overseas literature: (1) restriction of access to means of suicide; (2) guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicides; (3) provision of quality mental healthcare to atrisk populations; (4) school-based screening and prevention programs; (5) online prevention, monitoring, and support programs; and (6) life skills training programs. Research evidence supports that the provision of high-quality mental health services to at-risk populations and some school-based prevention programs (awareness and screening, and gatekeeper training) are effective in suicide prevention. Further research efforts are needed to verify the impact of the other four strategies. Practitioners could make better use of new prevention programs through the internet and instant messaging platforms, which have the potential to alter attitude toward suicide and self-harm as well as promoting help seeking behavior among young people.

Costs and revenues of specialized palliative care in the outpatient and inpatient sector,"Melching, Heiner; SPRINGER HEIDELBERG; Melching, Heiner; Melching, Heiner",2022,ONKOLOGIE,10.1007/s00761-022-01244-2,WOS:000865785700002,Germany,"If the question of whether specialized palliative care pays off is understood in such way that the effort and costs are well proportioned to the benefits to those affected and to society, the answer to this question is clearly yes. The clear focus on the needs of those affected, which also includes relatives, and which often goes hand in hand with the omission of useless, unwanted, and often expensive diagnostic procedures and therapies, makes palliative care a highly economic form of care. In our healthcare system, which has been increasingly economized for decades, the question of whether something ""pays off"" is usually understood as whether the proceeds are favorable in relation to the costs by which profit can be made. However, especially in the German hospital system, it is easier to achieve surpluses with cost-intensive interventions than with a type of care in which the costs for staff account for the largest share. Therefore, the ""problem"" for business people is not that palliative medicine is too expensive, but rather that it is too cheap in certain areas. In general, no universal statement can be made about how lucrative specialized palliative care is. In particular, the outpatient and inpatient areas must be considered differently due to the different systems. Only in the case of multiprofessional palliative services in hospitals can it be stated that this increasingly important area is currently not regularly reimbursed to cover costs. On the other hand, palliative care units can be designed to cover costs and still ensure a high level of quality, especially if ""secondary profits"" are taken into account.",0,0,Palliative care unit; Inpatient palliative services; Outpatient palliative services; Funding; Efficiency,Article

Health professionals, including occupational therapists (OTs), need to consider health literacy in order to optimise client-centred interventions that promote self-management of chronic conditions, health and wellness. The goal of this small-scale cohort study was to determine if a health literacy workshop series for OTs could improve their working knowledge of health literacy, and increase their self-perceived ability to identify, assess and implement client-centred interventions to at-risk patients. Design: Over a 6-week period, six OT professionals participated in a customised workshop series, incorporating elements of the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit (the Toolkit) and other AHRQ-supported health literacy resources. Method: A one-group, pre-posttest mixed methods design was used to measure outcomes. Results: Results of this study suggests that participation in a health literacy education programme featuring the Toolkit and other AHRQ-supported tools can improve OTs' self-perceived ability to identify, assess and provide client-centred services to their patients. Responses to open-ended questions both pre-and post-intervention align with the literature in that health care professionals, like OTs, can benefit from customised health literacy training to improve client-centred care by implementing specific health literacy strategies into their clinical practice.",0,0,Client-centred approaches; health literacy; occupational performance; occupational therapy; universal precautions; COMMUNICATION; CHALLENGE; KNOWLEDGE,Article

It investigates, in particular, changes in self-reported difficulties in accessing healthcare with regard to distance to health services, waiting times for appointments and the costs of seeing a doctor, and identifies particular risk factors that increase the likelihood of facing barriers in accessing health services. We conduct logistic regression analyses of cross-sectional data from the three rounds (2003, 2007, 2011) of the European Quality of Life Survey of 2682 individuals living in private households in Ireland. The study finds that the number of individuals reporting difficulties in accessing healthcare increased over time. Of particular concern are difficulties with the financial costs of covering doctor's appointments, which started to increase dramatically prior to the economic crisis and continued to rise during the crisis, in particular for higher income groups. Difficulties with distance and waiting time declined gradually over time and appear unaffected by the financial crisis, at least until 2011. Subgroups that face significantly more difficulties are women, younger individuals, the full-/part-time employed and individuals with poor health status.

Although the consequences of poor air quality are more severe in developing countries, they also have a critical impact in developed countries. Healthcare costs due to air pollution reach $150 billion in the USA, whereas particulate matter causes 412,000 premature deaths in Europe, every year. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), indoor air pollutant levels can be up to 100 times higher in comparison to outdoor air quality. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is in the top five environmental risks to global health and well-being. The research community explored the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in the past years to deal with this problem. The IAQ prediction systems contribute to smart environments where advanced sensing technologies can create healthy living conditions for building occupants. This paper reviews the applications and potential of AI for the prediction of IAQ to enhance building environment and public health. The results show that most of the studies analyzed incorporate neural networks-based models and the preferred evaluation metrics are RMSE, R-2 score and error rate. Furthermore, 66.6% of the studies include CO2 sensors for IAQ assessment. Temperature and humidity parameters are also included in 90.47% and 85.71% of the proposed methods, respectively. This study also presents some limitations of the current research activities associated with the evaluation of the impact of different pollutants based on different geographical conditions and living environments.

In pediatrics, the needs of both the caregiver and the pediatric patient have to be taken into account. Pediatric practices have been shifting toward a family-centered approach, although the primary drivers have not been well defined. Identifying the key patient experiences that lead to higher patient satisfaction would enable a more meaningful clinical encounter. To better understand patient experience, we examined waiting time and the elements of the physician patient interaction in pediatric neurology. We predict that the determining factor in patient satisfaction is the physician patient interaction. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Patient satisfaction surveys were sent to families via mail or e-mail after their ambulatory pediatric neurology visit. The visits took place between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014, at one of multiple locations in a children's health system spanning four states. A Likert scale was used for these surveys, and a top-box method (measuring percent of survey questions were rated 5 out of 5) was used to filter data from this database. Statistical analysis using a Pearson correlation was used for data analysis, with likelihood to recommend practice as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The five survey questions that correlated most with overall likelihood to recommend the practice were cheerfulness of practice (r = 0.79); staff working together (r = 0.76); cleanliness of practice (r = 0.70); wait time at clinic, from entering to leaving (r = 0.66); and likelihood of recommending care provider (r = 0.65). CONCLUSION: Pediatric neurologists striving to enhance overall patient satisfaction in their practices should work toward providing an atmosphere that supports office staff cheerfulness, teamwork, and visit efficiency provided in a clean and friendly environment.",0,0,patient experience; patient satisfaction; patient-physician interaction; family-centered care; QUALITY-OF-CARE; HEALTH-CARE; SATISFACTION; EDUCATION; TEAMWORK; SAFETY; US,Article

In an attempt to address these concerns, the Department of Justice and Fair Trade Commission announced that they will use market share screens and rule of reason treatment to evaluate ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. The use of market share screens and rule of reason treatment allows the antitrust agencies to avoid prioritizing either consumer surplus, or total surplus in the first instance but leaves open two critical questions: What will the rule of reason treatment afforded to ACOs look like? And how will the antitrust agencies ultimately determine whether ACOs benefit or harm consumers?

Methods The unit of analysis was the hospital. We merged the hospital medication alert system adoption survey data and Taiwan National Health Insurance outpatient claims data. The observation time was 1998 to 2011, divided into 5 periods (T1-T5). The analysis included 216 hospitals, and outcome variable was hospital-based outpatient duplicated medication rates. The system adoption time frame, hospital accreditation level, and number of drugs per prescription were defined as predicted variables. A generalized estimating equation regression model was used. Results Adoption of the advanced medication alert system gradually increased, such that 100% of medical centers and 84% of regional hospitals, but less than 50% of district hospitals, had systems by T5. The hospital-based outpatient duplicated medication rate continually decreased, from 29.8% to 11.2%. The generalized estimating equation model showed rates of duplicated medications of b = -8.44 at T2 and b = -17.88 at T5 (P < 0.001) compared with T1. Medical centers and regional hospitals demonstrated much lower duplication rates (b = -13.71, b = -6.82; P < 0.001) compared with district hospitals. Hospitals with more medications per prescription had higher duplication rates than did hospitals with fewer items.

Reduced competition may increase the premiums charged by insurers and their payments made to hospitals. However, it may also strengthen insurers' bargaining leverage when negotiating with hospitals, thereby generating offsetting cost decreases. To understand and measure this trade-off, we estimate a model of employer-insurer and hospital-insurer bargaining over premiums and reimbursements, household demand for insurance, and individual demand for hospitals using detailed California admissions, claims, and enrollment data. We simulate the removal of both large and small insurers from consumers' choice sets. Although consumer welfare decreases and premiums typically increase, we find that premiums can fall upon the removal of a small insurer if an employer imposes effective premium constraints through negotiations with the remaining insurers. We also document substantial heterogeneity in hospital price adjustments upon the removal of an insurer, with renegotiated price increases and decreases of as much as 10% across markets.",0,0,Health insurance; insurer competition; hospital prices; bargaining; countervailing power; ADVERSE SELECTION; INSURANCE MARKETS; BARGAINING POWER; VERTICAL MERGERS; HOSPITAL PRICES; INCENTIVES; CHOICE,Article

We used nationwide population-based data from Taiwan to explore the effects of care continuity and coordination on mortality and costs for heart failure. Methods: We analyzed all 18,991 heart failure patients 18 years of age or older and discharged from hospitals in 2016 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance claims data. Cox proportional hazard and multiple linear regression models were used, after adjustment for patient characteristics, to explore the relative impacts of the continuity of care (COC) index and care density on 1-year mortality and costs. Results: Higher COC index was associated with lower mortality (low vs. medium: hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-1.71; high vs. medium: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61-0.72) and costs (low vs. medium: cost ratio [CR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16; high vs. medium: CR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.88). Low care density was associated with higher mortality (low vs. medium: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.20). Higher care density was associated with lower costs (low vs. medium: CR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.18; high vs. medium: CR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.73-0.79). Conclusions: Low care continuity and coordination are associated with higher 1-year post-discharge mortality and costs. Facilitating care continuity and coordination may be an important strategy for improving value-based care for heart failure.",0,0,Continuity; Coordination; Outcomes; Mortality; Costs; Heart failure; PROFILING HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE; PHYSICIAN CONTINUITY; PROGNOSIS; MORTALITY; SURVIVAL; QUALITY; TRENDS; INDEX; RATES,Article

Methods and Study Design: Participants from the Elderly Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (1999-2000) formed this cohort. Dietary information was collected by 24-hr recall and simplified food frequency questionnaire. Dietary quality was assessed by dietary diversity score (DDS, 0-6). Annual medical service utilization and expenditure were derived from National Health Insurance claims until 2006. Survivorship was ascertained from the National Death Registry until 2008. Cox proportional- hazards models were used to determine the association between aboriginality and mortality in conjunction with dietary diversity. Results: Indigenes (n=156) compared with nonindigenes (n=1182) significantly differed in socio-demography, behaviors and chronic disease prevalences. For up to 8 years, indigenes had a higher mortality rate (46.2% vs 33.6%, p=0.003). Indigenes' nutrient intakes were less for polyunsaturated fat, dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals (but more sodium); food intakes more for meat, with less cooking oil, dairy products and fruits; and a lower DDS, (3.61 vs 4.54). They had a 41% higher mortality risk (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.09-1.81, p=0.008). Control for demographic variables did not change the findings. However, the increase in HR was substantially attenuated by the inclusion of DDS (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88-1.49, p=0.316). There was no significant interaction between aboriginality and DDS on mortality (p=0.673). Conclusions: Older indigenous Taiwanese have a higher mortality risk than their majority counterparts. Irrespective of aboriginality, the more diverse diet is associated with a lower risk of mortality.",0,0,Indigenous; mortality; dietary diversity; Taiwan; NAHSIT; HEART-FAILURE HOSPITALIZATION; HEALTH; DISEASE; DETERMINANTS; EXPENDITURE; AUSTRALIA; SURVIVAL; QUALITY; PEOPLES,Article
Assessing quality of primary diabetes care in South Korea and Taiwan using avoidable hospitalizations,"Kim, Hongsoo; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD; Kim, Hongsoo; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Kim, Hongsoo",2018,HEALTH POLICY,10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.09.009,WOS:000450380800011,South Korea; Taiwan,"Quality of primary diabetes care is a key health policy concern in many OECD countries with an aging population. This cross-national, population-based study examined the extent and attributes of diabetes related avoidable hospitalizations (DRAHs) in South Korea and Taiwan, both of which have social health insurance-based health systems with limited gate-keeping for hospitalizations. We analyzed comparable, nationally representative health insurance beneficiary datasets for the two countries (2002-2013), linked with community health resource data. The age- and sex-standardized DRAH rates were calculated, and multivariate, multi-level longitudinal modeling approaches were adopted. The DRAH rate decreased in Taiwan consistently during 2002-2013 and in Korea after 2011 only. Under the universal health coverage, people enjoyed high accessibility to care. A higher number of physician visits reduced DRAHs in Korea but not in Taiwan. Socio-economic disparities in DRAHs still existed in both countries, especially in Taiwan. We found a different trajectory in two similar health systems for the selected health system performance indicator for primary diabetes care. This can be partly explained by different policy approaches to diabetes management in the two countries over the years. Necessary are policy efforts to improve the quality and equality of primary diabetes care and better control of hospital admissions in these two health systems that provide generous access to care at a low cost in East Asia.

A better understanding of the cost and benefit of P4P is needed to improve program assessment. To this end, we assessed the effect of a P4P program using a quasi-experimental intervention and control design. Two different intervention groups were used, one consisting of newly enrolled P4P patients, and another using P4P patients who have been enrolled since the beginning of the study. Patient-level data on clinical indicators, utilization and expenditures, linked with national death registry, were collected for diabetic patients at a large regional hospital in Taiwan between 2007 and 2013. Net value, defined as the value of life years gained minus the cost of care, is calculated and compared for the intervention group of P4P patients with propensity score-matched non-P4P samples. We found that Taiwan's implementation of the P4P program for diabetic care yielded positive net values, ranging from $40,084 USD to $348,717 USD, with higher net values in the continuous enrollment model. Our results suggest that the health benefits from P4P enrollment may require a sufficient time frame to manifest, so a net value approach incorporating future predicted mortality risks may be especially important for studying chronic disease management. Future research on the mechanisms by which the Taiwan P4P program helped improve outcomes could help translate our findings to other clinical contexts.",0,0,Pay-for-performance; National Health Insurance; Diabetes; Net value; Taiwan; HEALTH-CARE; QUALITY,Article

Health spending per privately insured beneficiary differs by a factor of three across geographic areas and has a very low correlation with Medicare spending. For the privately insured, half of the spending variation is driven by price variation across regions, and half is driven by quantity variation. Prices vary substantially across regions, across hospitals within regions, and even within hospitals. For example, even for a nearly homogeneous service such as lower-limb magnetic resonance imaging, about a fifth of the total case-level price variation occurs within a hospital in the cross section. Hospital market structure is strongly associated with price levels and contract structure. Prices at monopoly hospitals are 12% higher than those in markets with four or more rivals. Monopoly hospitals also have contracts that load more risk on insurers (e.g., they have more cases with prices set as a share of their charges). In concentrated insurer markets the opposite occurs-hospitals have lower prices and bear more financial risk. Examining the 366 mergers and acquisitions that occurred between 2007 and 2011, we find that prices increased by over 6% when the merging hospitals were geographically close (e.g., 5 miles or less apart), but not when the hospitals were geographically distant (e.g., over 25 miles apart).

Academic health centers (AHCs), whose triple mission of clinical care, research, and education serves a critical role in the country's health care system, must adapt to this evolving environment. Doing so successfully, however, requires a broader understanding of the wide-ranging roles of the AHC. This article proposes a conceptual framework through which the triple mission is expanded along four new dimensions: health, innovation, community, and policy. Examples within the conceptual framework categories, such as the AHCs' safety net function, their contributions to local economies, and their role in right-sizing the health care workforce, illustrate how each of these dimensions provides a more robust picture of the modern AHC and demonstrates the value added by AHCs. This conceptual framework also offers a basis for developing new performance metrics by which AHCs, both individually and as a group, can be held accountable, and that can inform policy decisions affecting them. This closer examination of the myriad activities of modern AHCs clarifies their essential role in our health care system and will enable these institutions to evolve, improve, be held accountable for, and more fully serve the health of the nation.",0,0,HOSPITAL TEACHING INTENSITY; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; CARE; INTERVENTION; IMPROVEMENT; INNOVATION; MORTALITY; COMMUNITY; IMPACT,Article

This study aimed to assess the short-term impact of the program. Two hospitals in the greater Taipei area, one participating in the loyal patient model (13,319 enrollees) and one in the regional resident model (13,768 enrollees), were analyzed. Two comparison groups were selected by propensity score matching. Generalized estimating equation models with differences-in-differences analysis were used to examine the net effects of the capitation program on health care utilization, expenses, and outcomes.
