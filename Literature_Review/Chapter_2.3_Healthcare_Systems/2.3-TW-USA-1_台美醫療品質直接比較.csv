The influence of medical cost controls implemented by Taiwan's national health insurance program on doctor-patient relationships,"Chiu, Jhih-Ling; WILEY-BLACKWELL; Chiu, Jhih-Ling",2015,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,10.1002/hpm.2256,WOS:000351394800006,Taiwan,"To prevent medical costs from rising, the National Health Insurance administration implemented the global budget system for financial reform, effective 1 July 2004. Since the implementation of this system, patients have been required to pay for some medicines to limit costs to the system. More recently, as they have faced constant increases in health insurance fees and also faced an increase in the number of medical expenses they must pay during an economic recession and a rise in unemployment, would the economic burden on the people of Taiwan not be increased? Even though National Health Insurance is a form of social insurance, does it guarantee social equality? The value of the healthcare industry is irreplaceable, so the most critical concern is whether worsening doctor-patient relationships will worsen healthcare quality. In short, while the global budget system saves on National Health Insurance costs, whether its implementation has affected healthcare quality is also worth exploring. This commentary also hopes to serve as a reference for the implementation of national health insurance in the United States.

C.",2017,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY,10.12892/ejgo3350.2017,WOS:000406893500006,Taiwan,"Purpose: To investigate the characteristics of gynecologic cancer patients visiting the emergency department (ED). Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort of gynecologic cancer patients in ED visits from 2000 to 2012 was analyzed using the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000) which randomly selected 1,000,000 beneficiaries from the year 2000 Registry of Beneficiaries (n = 23.72 million). Results: There were 5,893 ED visits by 1,400 gynecologic cancer patients. The mean age was 55.22 14.60 years. The mean number of ED visits was 4.21 +/- 5.18. 657 (46.93%) patients that were admitted to hospital; 70.57% ED visits occurred in medical center. Abdominal pain (19.04%), complications of surgical and medical care (13.28%) and intestinal obstruction without mention of hernia (10.69%) are the most three common presenting symptoms except other symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions (24.79%); 62.56% of the medications prescribed in ED visits are of gastrointestinal category. The overall survival rate of ED visits was significantly lower than that of no ED visits (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Relatively low rate of hospital admission may indicate unnecessary ED visits resulting in healthcare costs. Abdominal pain is the most common specific symptoms at presentation. Most medications belong to the gastrointestinal category reminding us of the importance of nutrition support. ED visits were a significant poor prognostic factor for overall survival.",0,0,Gynecologic cancer; Emergency department; Admittance; Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD); UNITED-STATES; ADMISSIONS; CARE; CHEMOTHERAPY; MORTALITY; QUALITY; LIFE; ROOM; END,Article

A review protocol included searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Library, and PubMed using the following terms: telemonitoring, type 2 diabetes mellitus, self-management, and web-based Internet solutions. The technology used, trial design, quality of life measures, and the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were extracted. This review identified 426 publications; of these, 19 met preset inclusion criteria. Ten quasi-experimental research designs were found, of which seven were pre-posttest studies, two were cohort studies, and one was an interrupted time-series study; in addition, there were nine randomized controlled trials. Web-based remote monitoring from home to hospital is a viable approach for healthcare delivery and enhances patients' quality of life. Six of these studies were conducted in South Korea, five in the United States, three in the United Kingdom, two in Taiwan, and one each in Spain, Poland, and India. The duration of the studies varied from 4 weeks to 18 months, and the participants were all adults. Fifteen studies showed positive improvement in HbA1c levels. One study showed high acceptance of the technology among participants. It remains challenging to identify clear evidence of effectiveness in the rapidly changing area of remote monitoring in diabetes care. Both the technology and its implementations are complex. The optimal design of a telemedicine system is still uncertain, and the value of the real-time blood glucose transmissions is still controversial.",0,0,GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN; TITRATION SYSTEM; BLOOD-GLUCOSE; MOBILE PHONE; PRIMARY-CARE; MANAGEMENT; TELEMEDICINE; TIME; INTERVENTIONS; LESSONS,Review

Taiwan is geographically close to Southeast and South Asia, but the needs and expectations of Taiwanese travelers with regard to travel medicine are still largely unknown. This study aimed to clarify the pretravel preparations, needs, willingness to seek pretravel consultation, and factors associated with willingness, in order to provide valuable information for improvement of healthcare service.Methods: Data were collected with anonymous structured questionnaires distributed to 477 visitors who tried to get travel health information from New Southbound Health Center between June and November 2019. A multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis was applied to identify factors associated with the visitors' willingness to seek pretravel consultation.Results: A total of 304 questionnaires (64%) were collected. Eighty-three percent of the respondents were willing to seek pretravel consultation. A higher level of education (odds ratio 3.6 [95% CI 1.58-8.22]), having a plan to obtain travel medical insurance (2.5 [1.18-5.28]), concern with gastrointestinal diseases (2.0 [1.04-3.94]), concern with mosquito-borne diseases (2.0 [2.07-3.95]), and concern with noncommunicable diseases (2.2 [1.02-4.96]) were independent factors associated with willingness to seek pretravel consultation.: Conclusions: We found that most of the travelers were willing to seek pretravel consultation. Our study high-lighted the need to enhance awareness about travel-related illness among these travelers. Strategies should be tailored according to these findings to help prevent epidemics and improve healthcare service in the future.",0,0,Travel health; Pretravel consultation; Infectious disease; Cross -border transmission; Risk management; Healthcare service; INTERNATIONAL TRAVELERS; JAPANESE TRAVELERS; HEALTH KNOWLEDGE; VISIT FRIENDS; UNITED-STATES; ATTITUDES; VACCINATION; INFECTION; RELATIVES; BEHAVIOR,Article

We individually followed each subject for a 1-year period to evaluate their healthcare resource utilization. Outcome variables of the healthcare resource utilization were as follows: numbers of outpatient visits and inpatient days and the mean costs of outpatient and inpatient treatment. In addition, we divided healthcare resource utilization into ophthalmologic and nonophthalmologic services.Results:As for the utilization of ophthalmologic services, OAG subjects had significantly more outpatient visits (7.4 vs. 1.3, P<0.001) and significantly higher outpatient costs (US$272 vs. US$39, P<0.001) than comparison subjects. For nonophthalmologic services, OAG subjects also had significantly more outpatient visits (29.4 vs. 21.8, P<0.001) and significantly higher outpatient costs (US$1263 vs. US$847, P<0.001) than comparison subjects. Furthermore, OAG subjects incurred significantly higher inpatient costs compared with comparison subjects (US$434 vs. US$234, P<0.001). For all healthcare services, OAG subjects had significantly more outpatient visits (36.8 vs. 23.1, P<0.001) and significantly higher outpatient (US$1535 vs. US$887, P<0.001) and total (US$2245 vs. US$1122, P<0.001) costs than comparison subjects. In other words, the total cost was about 2-fold greater for OAG subjects than comparison subjects.Conclusions:We concluded that subjects with OAG had significantly higher utilization of all healthcare services than comparison subjects.",0,0,open-angle glaucoma; utilization; costs; glaucoma; MOORFIELDS COLLABORATIVE GLAUCOMA; INSURANCE RESEARCH DATABASE; RESOURCE UTILIZATION; UNITED-STATES; COSTS; PREVALENCE; EYE; DISEASE; EUROPE; MULTICENTER,Article

The experiences of our international colleagues should be utilized to protect patients and healthcare workers. The primary aim of this article is to appraise national guidelines for the perioperative anesthetic management of patients with COVID-19 so that they can be enhanced for the management of any resurgence of the epidemic. PubMed and EMBASE databases were systematically searched for guidelines related to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the World Federation Society of Anesthesiologists COVID-19 resource webpage was searched for national guidelines; the search was expanded to include countries with a high incidence of SARS-CoV. The guidelines were evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. Guidelines from Australia, Canada, China, India, Italy, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America were evaluated. All the guidelines focused predominantly on intubation and infection control. The scope and purpose of guidelines from China were the most comprehensive. The UK and South Africa provided the best clarity. Editorial independence, the rigor of development, and applicability scored poorly. Heterogeneity and gaps pertaining to preoperative screening, anesthesia technique, subspecialty anesthesia, and the lack of auditing of guidelines were identified. Evidence supporting the recommendations was weak. Early guidelines for the anesthetic management of COVID-19 patients lacked quality and a robust reporting framework. As new evidence emerges, national guidelines should be updated to enhance rigor, clarity, and applicability.",0,0,Anesthesia; Coronavirus infections; COVID-19; Guidelines; Perioperative management; Perioperative medicine; Review; ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME; CHINESE SOCIETY; PANDEMIC RECOMMENDATIONS; TRACHEAL INTUBATION; INFECTION-CONTROL; INTENSIVE-CARE; TASK-FORCE; MANAGEMENT; CONSENSUS; NEUROSCIENCE,Review
