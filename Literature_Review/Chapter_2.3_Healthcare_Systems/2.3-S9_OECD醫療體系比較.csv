A comparison of the robust conditional order-m estimation and two stage DEA in measuring healthcare efficiency among California counties,"Gearhart, Richard S., III; Michieka, Nyakundi M.; ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV; Gearhart, Richard S., III; Michieka, Nyakundi M.; Gearhart, Richard S., III; Michieka, Nyakundi; Michieka, Nyakundi",2018,ECONOMIC MODELLING,10.1016/j.econmod.2018.04.015,WOS:000440771000031,USA,"This paper examines cross-county healthcare efficiency rankings using modem non-parametric estimators, while taking into account secondary environmental variables. Results indicate that output-direction efficiency estimates yield counties producing inefficiently for both order-alpha and order-m estimators. After accounting for a variety of secondary environmental variables, unconditional efficiency estimates improve by anywhere between 7.5 and 10-percentage points. Results show that there is little correlation between the highly visible Robert-Woods-Johnson Foundation estimates with those derived here. We also find that counties are more efficient when they possess lower rates of obesity, unemployment, and preventable hospital readmissions. In addition, demographic variables do not play much of a role in explaining cross-county inefficiency. The analysis shows that the two stage DEA is inappropriate and violates several assumptions in comparison to the conditional order-m estimation.",0,0,Conditional order-m estimator; Conditional efficiency; Order- alpha; California counties; Nonparametric econometrics; NONPARAMETRIC FRONTIER MODELS; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES; QUANTILE ESTIMATION; OECD COUNTRIES; RANKINGS; INEFFICIENCY; OBESITY; IMPACT,Article
Multi-directional Robust Benefit of the Doubt model: An application to the measurement of the quality of acute care services in OECD countries,"Vidoli, F.; Fusco, E.; Pignataro, G.; Guccio, C.; ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC; Vidoli, F.; Fusco, E.; Pignataro, G.; Guccio, C.; Pignataro, G.; Vidoli, F.; Pignataro, Giacomo; Guccio, Calogero; Fusco, Elisa; Pignataro, Giacomo; Fusco, Elisa; Vidoli, Francesco",2024,SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES,10.1016/j.seps.2024.101877,WOS:001289933500001,Italy,"While individual metrics in evaluating healthcare quality offer in-depth insights into particular areas, they frequently fail to encompass all pertinent information. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop composite measures that comprehensively assess the overall quality or performance of specific care services, especially those not covered by official OECD measures. A novel multi-directional robust Benefit-of-the-doubt approach is proposed to measure overall acute care services quality through a composite indicator while, at the same time, highlighting the potential improvement directions for each single component indicator. First, an approach based on simulated data has been carried out to better describe the advantages of the proposed approach, and then the methodology has been applied to country-level OECD data drawn from the Healthcare Quality and Outcomes programme.",0,0,Robust composite indicators; Non-compensatory; Multi-directional Benefit of the Doubt; Acute care quality; COMPOSITE INDICATORS; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK,Article
Why healthcare providers merge,"Postma, Jeroen; Roos, Anne-Fleur; CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS; Postma, Jeroen; Roos, Anne-Fleur; Postma, Jeroen",2016,HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW,10.1017/S1744133115000304,WOS:000372511000001,Netherlands,"In many OECD countries, healthcare sectors have become increasingly concentrated as a result of mergers. However, detailed empirical insight into why healthcare providers merge is lacking. Also, we know little about the influence of national healthcare policies on mergers. We fill this gap in the literature by conducting a survey study on mergers among 848 Dutch healthcare executives, of which 35% responded (resulting in a study sample of 239 executives). A total of 65% of the respondents was involved in at least one merger between 2005 and 2012. During this period, Dutch healthcare providers faced a number of policy changes, including increasing competition, more pressure from purchasers, growing financial risks, de-institutionalisation of long-term care and decentralisation of healthcare services to municipalities. Our empirical study shows that healthcare providers predominantly merge to improve the provision of healthcare services and to strengthen their market position. Also efficiency and financial reasons are important drivers of merger activity in healthcare. We find that motives for merger are related to changes in health policies, in particular to the increasing pressure from competitors, insurers and municipalities.",0,0,HOSPITAL MERGERS; COMPETITION; ACQUISITIONS; NETHERLANDS; REORGANIZATION; ORGANIZATIONS; CONSOLIDATION; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; OUTCOMES,Article
Is the efficiency of the healthcare system linked to the country's economic performance?

The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied as a quantitative tool. I examine three models using infant mortality and potential years of life lost as output indicators. These models differ only in the way of expressing healthcare inputs. The DEA computations show that neither the Bismarckian nor the Beveridgean healthcare system has a clear advantage over the other when inputs are expressed by health expenditure as a percentage of GDP. Themodelwhich uses USDper head expenditure data at purchasing power parity shows a slight advantage of the Beveridge-style systems. This confirms the common opinion that the Bismarck-style systems perform worse in controlling the costs. When inputs are expressed using physical units (medical staff and equipment), DEA shows that the Beveridge system is significantly more efficient than the Bismarckian ones. I analyse the relationship between the DEA scores and the country's GDP per capita, as well. This analysis shows that more developed economies are technically less efficient. These findings are consistent with the belief that technical efficiency is only one of the many criteria that determine the quality of the healthcare system and patient satisfaction.",0,0,healthcare systems; efficiency; DEA; economic welfare; DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; SLACKS-BASED MEASURE; COST DISEASE; POLITICS; CONTEXT; REFORMS; EUROPE; ACCESS; SCALE,Article

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of the financial crisis on public health expenditure in bailout countries and if bailouts shift the burden of paying for healthcare from the state onto individuals.MethodsQuantitative health expenditure data were collected from the WHO and OECD for the period 2004-2015 and evaluated using a comparison of means Welch's t test.ResultsThe majority of bailout countries recorded a decrease in public health expenditure as a percentage of total government expenditure, with Ireland recording the largest decrease with government health expenditure as a percentage of total government expenditure, falling by 22% (P<.01). In addition, the results also suggest that the burden of paying for healthcare shifted from the state onto individuals in three countries, namely Hungary, Ireland and Portugal, where public health expenditure declined and private expenditure increased significantly.ConclusionsThe ramifications of shifting the burden of paying for healthcare from the state onto individuals at this point remain unclear with further research required to identify the long-term consequences for healthcare.",0,0,Bailouts; Europe; Financial crisis; Healthcare expenditure; FINANCIAL CRISIS; ECONOMIC-CRISIS; AUSTERITY; IRELAND; SYSTEM; NEEDS; SERVICES; COVERAGE; IMPACT,Article
The Importance of Implementing Environmental Variables in the Process of Assessment of Healthcare Efficiency through DEA<SUP>1</SUP>,"Kocisova, Kristina; Gavurova, Beata; Behun, Marcel; INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS; Kocisova, Kristina; Gavurova, Beata; Gavurova, Beata; Behun, Marcel; Kocisova, Kristina; Kocisova, Kristina; Gavurova, Beata; Kocisova, Kristina; Behun, Marcel; Behun, Marcel; Gavurová, Beáta",2019,EKONOMICKY CASOPIS,N/A,WOS:000473585600002,Slovakia,"In this paper, the regional efficiency of healthcare facilities in Slovakia is measured (2008 - 2015) using a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The window DEA was chosen since it leads to increased differentiation of results, especially when applied to small samples, and it enables year-by-year comparisons of the results. Two inputs (number of beds, number of medical staff) and two outputs (use of beds, average nursing time) were chosen as variables in output-oriented 4-year window DEA model for the assessment of technical efficiency in 8 Slovak regions. As the regional efficiency is driven by natural, historical, macro-economic and political conditions, in the next stage the impact of environmental factors on efficiency is examined. The results have confirmed that the public costs, private costs, departments, higher education, population over 65, life expectancy, wage costs, population size and income inequality indicator s80/s20 are statistically significant and therefore affect the efficiency of healthcare facilities in Slovakia.",0,0,regional efficiency; data envelopment analysis; window analysis; regression analysis; TECHNICAL EFFICIENCY; OECD COUNTRIES; HOSPITALS; PERFORMANCE; INDICATORS,Article
