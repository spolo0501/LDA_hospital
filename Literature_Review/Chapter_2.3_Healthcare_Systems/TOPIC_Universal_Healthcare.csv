Linking State Intervention and Health Equity Differently: The Universalization of Health Care in South Korea and Taiwan,"Yi, Ilcheong; Sohn, Hyuk-Sang; Kim, Taekyoon; INST KOREAN STUDIES; Yi, Ilcheong; Sohn, Hyuk-Sang; Sohn, Hyuk-Sang; Kim, Taekyoon; Sohn, Hyuk-Sang; Sohn, Hyuk-Sang; Yi, Ilcheong; Yi, Ilcheong",2015,KOREA OBSERVER,,WOS:000362156200004,Switzerland; South Korea,"This study sets out to compare the process of the universalization of health insurance in South Korea and Taiwan, with a particular focus on the similarities of the commercial elements, such as the dominance of a private provider and user fees. What were both the constraints on, and the challenges to government policies to establish universal health insurance with commercial elements? Are there differences between the cases of these two countries? If there are, what caused those differences? What role have the state, market and civil society institutions played in shaping the health systems of these countries? To answer these questions, this paper analyzes the roles of historical institutional legacies, competitive election, active civil society, the education of doctors and nurses, the allocation of medical human resources in the labor market, the medical device industry, public and private hospitals and inter-sectoral policy measures, with a focus on the linkages within and between the health system and other sectors. It is fair to argue that the different modes of government interventions in various sectors and their varying degrees, in terms of enforcement, resulted in the universal health systems of the two countries being qualitatively different, and resulted in different consequences as regards health equity.",5,0,Universalization; Health System; National Health Insurance; State Intervention; Transformative Social Policy,Article
"The impact of publicly subsidised health insurance on access, behavioural risk factors and disease management","Miraldo, Marisa; Propper, Carol; Williams, Rachael I.; PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD; Miraldo, Marisa; Propper, Carol; Miraldo, Marisa; Propper, Carol; Propper, Carol; Williams, Rachael I.; Williams, Rachael I.; Miraldo, Marisa; Miraldo, Marisa; Miraldo, Marisa; Propper, Carol",2018,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.09.028,WOS:000449445100017,England,"In 2006, the Massachusetts healthcare reform was introduced to mandate health insurance, extend eligibility of publicly subsidised health insurance, improve quality and access to care and develop preventive health services. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of expanding publicly subsidised health insurance through the Massachusetts reform on access to primary care, disease management and behavioural risk factors. Using cross-sectional data from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2001 to 2010 and exploiting the selective introduction of the healthcare reform, we assessed its impact on primary care access, behavioural risk factors, such as obesity, and receipt of diabetes management tests. We did so using a differences in-differences methodology by comparing Massachusetts with other New England States for 131,002 adults under 300% of the federal poverty level and by race/ethnicity within this group. Triple difference estimates were also conducted to control for potential within state time varying confounding factors. The results suggest that increasing publicly subsidised health insurance had a positive impact on primary care access for lower income adults, particularly those that are white. However, with the exception of improvements in alcohol consumption for one specific group (lower income whites) the reform had no effect on behaviour risk factors or diabetes disease management. The aims of the reform were to improve access to care and through this, behavioural risk factors and diabetes management. This study suggests that while access to care was increased, reducing risk factors attributed to health risky behaviour and diabetes cannot be sufficiently done simply by extending health insurance coverage and the provision of preventive services. This suggests that more targeted interventions are required.",1,0,United States of America; Healthcare reform; Health policy; Health insurance; Behavioural risk factor surveillance system; Health disparities; Primary care access; Disease management; UNITED-STATES; PRIMARY-CARE; MASSACHUSETTS REFORM; NATIONAL-HEALTH; DISPARITIES; INTERVENTION; COVERAGE; SURVEILLANCE; INDIVIDUALS; POPULATION,Article

Workshop series for occupational therapists using the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit and other supported tools,"Koenig, Virginia E.; Provident, Ingrid M.; SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD; Koenig, Virginia E.; Provident, Ingrid M.; Koenig, Virginia E.",2019,HEALTH EDUCATION JOURNAL,10.1177/0017896918820067,WOS:000466429700007,USA,"Objective: Health literacy is the ability to access, understand, evaluate and communicate information in a manner that promotes, maintains and improves health care in a variety of settings across the life span. Health professionals, including occupational therapists (OTs), need to consider health literacy in order to optimise client-centred interventions that promote self-management of chronic conditions, health and wellness. The goal of this small-scale cohort study was to determine if a health literacy workshop series for OTs could improve their working knowledge of health literacy, and increase their self-perceived ability to identify, assess and implement client-centred interventions to at-risk patients. Design: Over a 6-week period, six OT professionals participated in a customised workshop series, incorporating elements of the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit (the Toolkit) and other AHRQ-supported health literacy resources. Method: A one-group, pre-posttest mixed methods design was used to measure outcomes. Results: Results of this study suggests that participation in a health literacy education programme featuring the Toolkit and other AHRQ-supported tools can improve OTs' self-perceived ability to identify, assess and provide client-centred services to their patients. Responses to open-ended questions both pre-and post-intervention align with the literature in that health care professionals, like OTs, can benefit from customised health literacy training to improve client-centred care by implementing specific health literacy strategies into their clinical practice.",0,0,Client-centred approaches; health literacy; occupational performance; occupational therapy; universal precautions; COMMUNICATION; CHALLENGE; KNOWLEDGE,Article

Objective: Using a modified version of the 1978 Tanahashi model as an analytical framework for measuring and assessing health service coverage, this paper aims to examine the system of care at the community level in Ghana's Volta Region to highlight the continued reforms needed to achieve Universal Health Coverage. Methods: The Tanahashi model evaluates health system coverage through five key measures that reflect different stages along the service provision continuum: availability of services; accessibility; initial contact with the health system; continued utilization; and quality coverage. Data from cross-sectional household and health facility surveys were used in this study. Immunization and antenatal care services were selected as tracer interventions to serve as proxies to assess systems bottlenecks. Results: Financial access and quality coverage were identified as the biggest bottlenecks for both tracer indicators. Financial accessibility, measured by enrollment in Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme was poor with 16.94% presenting valid membership cards. Childhood immunization was high but dropped modestly from 93.8% at initial contact to 76.7% quality coverage. For antenatal care, estimates ranged from 65.9% at initial visit to 25.1% quality coverage. Conclusion: Results highlight the difficulty in achieving high levels of quality service coverage and the large variations that exist within services provided at the primary care level. While vertical investments have been prioritized to benefit specific health services, a comprehensive systems approach to primary health care needs to be further strengthened to reach Ghana's Universal Health Coverage objectives.",0,0,Health systems; systems evaluation; health policy; universal health coverage; primary health care; ACHIEVE; PROGRAM; IMPACT,Article
Breast cancer in Thailand: policy and health system challenges to universal healthcare,"Lakha, Fatim; Suriyawongpaisul, Paibul; Sangrajrang, Suleeporn; Leerapan, Borwornsom; Coker, Richard; OXFORD UNIV PRESS; Lakha, Fatim; Coker, Richard; Suriyawongpaisul, Paibul; Leerapan, Borwornsom; Sangrajrang, Suleeporn; Lakha, Fatim; Leerapan, Borwornsom; Lakha, Fatim",2020,HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING,10.1093/heapol/czaa063,WOS:000615925000003,England; Thailand,"Thailand has successfully implemented Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and embedded the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into its Thailand 4.0 policy. Breast cancer is a growing challenge in Thailand, as it is globally. It serves as a perfect medium through which to interrogate UHC and demonstrate areas of the health system which require further strengthening if UHC is to be sustainable in the longer term. We conducted a situation analysis and used a Systemic Rapid Assessment (SYSRA) framework to examine the challenges posed to UHC through the lens of breast cancer. We identified a number of challenges facing UHC including (1) continued political commitment; (2) the need for coordinated scale-up of strategic investments involving increased financing and fine-tuning of the allocation of resources according to health needs; (3) reducing inequities between health insurance schemes; (4) investing in innovation of technologies, and more critically, in technology transfer and capacity building; (5) increasing capacity, quality and confidence in the whole primary healthcare team but especially family medicine doctors. This would subsequently increase both efficiency and effectiveness of the patient pathway, as well as allow patients wherever possible to be treated close to their homes, work and family; (6) developing and connecting information systems to facilitate understanding of what is working, where needs are and track trends to monitor improvements in patient care. Our findings add to an existing body of evidence which suggest, in light of changing disease burden and increasing costs of care, a need for broader health system reforms to create a more enabling platform for integrated healthcare as opposed to addressing individual challenging elements one vertical system at a time. As low- and middle-income countries look to realize the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable UHC this analysis may provide input for policy discussion at national, regional and community levels and have applicability beyond breast cancer services alone and beyond Thailand.",0,0,Health system strengthening; universal healthcare; breast cancer; equity; challenges; MENTAL-HEALTH; SCALING-UP; COVERAGE; COUNTRIES; SURVIVAL; EXPERIENCE; MORTALITY; PAYMENTS,Article
The influence of medical cost controls implemented by Taiwan's national health insurance program on doctor-patient relationships,"Chiu, Jhih-Ling; WILEY-BLACKWELL; Chiu, Jhih-Ling",2015,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,10.1002/hpm.2256,WOS:000351394800006,Taiwan,"To prevent medical costs from rising, the National Health Insurance administration implemented the global budget system for financial reform, effective 1 July 2004. Since the implementation of this system, patients have been required to pay for some medicines to limit costs to the system. More recently, as they have faced constant increases in health insurance fees and also faced an increase in the number of medical expenses they must pay during an economic recession and a rise in unemployment, would the economic burden on the people of Taiwan not be increased? Even though National Health Insurance is a form of social insurance, does it guarantee social equality? The value of the healthcare industry is irreplaceable, so the most critical concern is whether worsening doctor-patient relationships will worsen healthcare quality. In short, while the global budget system saves on National Health Insurance costs, whether its implementation has affected healthcare quality is also worth exploring. This commentary also hopes to serve as a reference for the implementation of national health insurance in the United States.

The Impacts of Medicaid Expansion on Rural Low-Income Adults: Lessons From the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment,"Allen, Heidi; Wright, Bill; Broffman, Lauren; SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC; Allen, Heidi; Wright, Bill; Broffman, Lauren; Allen, Heidi",2018,MEDICAL CARE RESEARCH AND REVIEW,10.1177/1077558716688793,WOS:000432238900005,USA,"Medicaid expansions through the Affordable Care Act began in January 2014, but we have little information about what is happening in rural areas where provider access and patient resources might be more limited. In 2008, Oregon held a lottery for restricted access to its Medicaid program for uninsured low-income adults not otherwise eligible for public coverage. The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment used this opportunity to conduct the first randomized controlled study of a public insurance expansion. This analysis builds off of previous work by comparing rural and urban survey outcomes and adds qualitative interviews with 86 rural study participants for context. We examine health care access and use, personal finances, and self-reported health. While urban and rural populations have unique demographic profiles, rural populations appear to have benefited from Medicaid as much as urban. Qualitative interviews revealed the distinctive challenges still facing low-income uninsured and newly insured rural populations.",0,0,medicaid; rural; access; Affordable Care Act; URBAN DISPARITIES; UNITED-STATES; CARE; ACCESS; US; PATTERNS; QUALITY; STAGE; AREAS,Article
Universal health coverage and equal access in Sweden: a century-long perspective on macro-level policy,"Fredriksson, Mio; BMC; Fredriksson, Mio; Fredriksson, Mio",2024,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH,10.1186/s12939-024-02193-5,WOS:001233940300001,Sweden,"Background When today's efforts to achieve universal health coverage are mainly directed towards low-income settings, it is perhaps easy to forget that countries considered to have universal, comprehensive and high-performing health systems have also undergone this journey. In this article, the aim is to provide a century-long perspective to illustrate Sweden's long and ongoing journey towards universal health coverage and equal access to healthcare.Methods The focus is on macro-level policy. A document analysis is divided into three broad eras (1919-1955; 1955-1989; 1989-) and synthesises seven points in time when policies relevant to overarching goals and regulation of universal health coverage and equal access were proposed and/or implemented. The development is analysed and concluded in relation to two egalitarian goals in the context of health: equality of access and equal treatment for equal need.Results Over the past century, macro-level policy evolved from the concept of creating access for the neediest and those reliant on wages for their survival to a mandatory insurance with equal right to healthcare for all. However, universal health coverage was not achieved until 1955, and individuals had to rely on their personal financial resources to cover the cost at the time of care utilization until the 1970s. It was not until 1983 that legislation explicitly stated that access to healthcare should be equal for the entire population (horizontal equity), while a vertical equity-principle was not added until 1997. Subsequently, ideas of free choice and privatization have gained significance. For instance, they aim to increase service access, addressing the Swedish health system's Achilles' heel in this regard. However, the principle of equal access for all is now being challenged by the emergence of private health insurance, which offers quicker access to services.Conclusions: brief summary and potential implications It can be concluded that there is no perpetual Swedish healthcare model and various dimensions of access have been the focus of policy discussion. The discussion on access barriers has shifted from financial to personal and organizational ones. Today, Sweden still ranks high in terms of affordability and equity in international comparisons: although not as well as a decade ago. Whether this marks the beginning of a new trend intertwined with a decline in Sweden's welfare 'exceptionalism', or is a temporary decline remains to be assessed in the future.",0,0,Universal health coverage; Equal access; Sweden; Swedish model; Horizontal equity; Vertical equity; WELFARE-STATE; CHOICE; CARE; EUROPE; EQUITY; WILL,Article
Does Insurance Effect the Outcome in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome?: An Insight from the Most Recent National Inpatient Sample,"Chakraborty, Sandipan; Bandyopadhyay, Dhrubajyoti; Amgai, Birendra; Sidhu, Jasdeep Singh; Paudel, Rabin; Koirala, Soniya; Hajra, Adrija; Ghosh, Raktim K.; Lavie, Carl J.; MOSBY-ELSEVIER; Sidhu, Jasdeep; Bandyopadhyay, Dhrubajyoti; Hajra, Adrija; Lavie, Carl",2021,CURRENT PROBLEMS IN CARDIOLOGY,10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2019.02.003,WOS:000595359900001,,"Several studies have shown disparities in outcome in the patients with Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on several factors. Treatment might differ based on insurance type. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed National Inpatient Sample (NIS 2016) data to identify the impact of different types of insurances on mortality outcome in patients admitted with ACS. ICD-CM-10 codes were used to identify hospital discharges with a principal diagnosis of ACS. Observations were stratified based on insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, Private, and No insurance). Primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of stay and total cost. Any potential confounders were adjusted using multivariate logistic regression. STATA/IC 15.1 Stata Corp LLC was used for analysis. A total of 8,01,195 hospitalizations with the primary diagnosis of ACS were identified, of which 59.2% had Medicare, 9.72% had Medicaid, 26.8% had Private insurance, and 4.3% had no insurance. Higher odds of mortality were seen in the patients with Medicare, Medicaid, and Noninsured group. Adjusted Odds ratio for mortality in Medicare was 1.01 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-1.1; P = 0.65), in Medicaid was 1.16 (CI: 1.03-1.30; P = 0.01) and in uninsured group was 1.46 (CI: 1.26-1.69; P <= 0.01). However, the patients with private insurance adjusted odds ratio for mortality were 0.77 (CI: 0.70-0.84; P <= 0.01) compared to the patients with other insurance groups. Above results show that the disparity exists in the outcome of patients admitted with ACS based on their insurance types, particularly for Medicaid patients. We need further studies to understand the root cause of this disparity.",0,0,ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; PRACTICE GUIDELINES COMMITTEE; ASSOCIATION TASK-FORCE; ETHNIC DISPARITIES; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; UNSTABLE ANGINA; CARE; QUALITY; MANAGEMENT; MORTALITY,Review
