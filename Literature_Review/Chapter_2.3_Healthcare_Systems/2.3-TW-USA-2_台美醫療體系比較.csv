DESIGN Retrospective cross sectional cohort study. SETTING Patient level administrative data from the United States, Canada (Ontario and Manitoba), England, the Netherlands, Israel, and Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS Adults aged 66 years and older admitted to hospital with STEMI or NSTEMI between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2017. OUTCOMES MEASURES The three categories of outcomes were coronary revascularisation (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), mortality, and efficiency (hospital length of stay and 30 day readmission). Rates were standardised to the age and sex distribution of the US acute myocardial infarction population in 2017. Outcomes were assessed separately for STEMI and NSTEMI. Performance was evaluated longitudinally (over time) and cross sectionally (between countries). RESULTS The total number of hospital admissions ranged from 19 043 in Israel to 1 064 099 in the US. Large differences were found between countries for all outcomes. For example, the proportion of patients admitted to hospital with STEMI who received percutaneous coronary intervention in hospital during 2017 ranged from 36.9% (England) to 78.6% (Canada; 71.8% in the US); use of percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI increased in all countries between 2011 and 2017, with particularly large rises in Israel (48.4-65.9%) and Taiwan (49.4-70.2%). The proportion of patients with NSTEMI who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 90 days of admission during 2017 was lowest in the Netherlands (3.5%) and highest in the US (11.7%). Death within one year of admission for STEMI in 2017 ranged from 18.9% (Netherlands) to 27.8% (US) and 32.3% (Taiwan). Mean hospital length of stay in 2017 for STEMI was lowest in the Netherlands and the US (5.0 and 5.1 days) and highest in Taiwan (8.5 days); 30 day readmission for STEMI was lowest in Taiwan (11.7%) and the US (12.2%) and highest in England (23.1%). CONCLUSIONS In an analysis of myocardial infarction in six high income countries, all countries had areas of high performance, but no country excelled in all three domains. Our findings suggest that countries could learn from each other by using international comparisons of patient level nationally representative data.",0,0,Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Academy; Acute; Acute myocardial infarction; Address; Admission activity; Affect; Age; Age Distribution; Algorithms; Aortic Aneurysm; Canada; Cardiac Catheterization Procedures; Carotid Arteries; Clinical; Collaborations; Comparative Study; Congestive Heart Failure; Consult; Country; Data; Development; Disadvantaged; Disease; Economics; Elderly; England; Epidemiology; Future; Health; Health system; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Hip Fractures; Hospitals; Imaging Techniques; Income; Inequality; Infant Mortality; Inferior; Injury; International; Investments; Ischemic Stroke; Israel; Knowledge; Lead; Learning; Length of Stay; Life Expectancy; Literature; Measures; Medical; Medicine; Methods; Netherlands; Older Population; Outcome; Outpatients; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Policies; Population; Population Study; Province; Replacement Arthroplasty; Research; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Research Support; Resource Allocation; Sex Distribution; Site; Social Work; Societal Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Time; Tracer; Treatment Effectiveness; Treatment outcome; Update; Visit; Work; acute care; common treatment; comorbidity; comparative; cost; disadvantaged population; experience; head-to-head comparison; health care service utilization; health difference; hospital readmission; hospitalization rates; improved; insight; low socioeconomic status; mortality; older patient; patient subsets; peer; population health; procedure cost; repaired; safety net; social; social deprivation; treatment comparison; PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION; ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION; UNITED-STATES; ACCF/AHA GUIDELINE; FOCUSED UPDATE; TASK-FORCE; CARE; MANAGEMENT; ASSOCIATION; SOCIETY,Article
Safety surveillance of varicella vaccine using tree-temporal scan analysis,"Liu, Chia-Hung; Huang, Wan-Ting; Chie, Wei-Chu; Chan, K.

Conventional active surveillance focuses on predefined AEs. Advanced data mining tools could be used to identify unusual clusters of potential AEs after vaccination. Objective: To assess the feasibility of a novel tree-based statistical approach to the identification of AE clustering following the implementation of a varicella vaccination program among one-year-olds. Setting and participants: This nationwide safety surveillance was based on data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance database and National Immunization Information System for the period 2004 through 2014. The study population was children aged 12-35 months who received the varicella vaccine. Exposure: First-dose varicella vaccine. Outcomes and measures: All incident ICD-9-CM diagnoses (emergency or inpatient departments) occur-ring 1-56 days after the varicella vaccination were classified within a hierarchical system of diagnosis categories using Multi-Level Clinical Classifications Software. A self-controlled tree-temporal data mining tool was then used to explore the incidence of AE clustering with a variety of potential risk intervals. The comparison interval consisted of days in the 56-day follow-up period that fell outside the risk interval. Results: Among 1,194,189 varicella vaccinees with no other same-day vaccinations, nine diagnoses with clustering features were categorized into four safety signals: fever on days 1-6 (attributable risk [AR] 38.5 per 100,000, p < 0.001), gastritis and duodenitis on days 1-2 (AR 5.9 per 100,000, p < 0.001), acute upper respiratory infection on days 1-5 (AR 11.0 per 100,000, p = 0.006), and varicella infection on days 1-9 (AR 2.7 per 100,000, p < 0.001). These safety profiles and their corresponding risk intervals have been identified in previous safety surveillance studies. Conclusions: Unexpected clusters of AEs were not detected after the mass administration of childhood varicella vaccines in Taiwan. The tree-temporal statistical method is a feasible approach to the safety surveillance of vaccines in populations of young children. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Improvement in the Survival Rates of Very Low Birth Weight Infants after the Establishment of the Korean Neonatal Network: Comparison between the 2000s and 2010s,"Chung, Sung-Hoon; Bae, Chong-Woo; KOREAN ACAD MEDICAL SCIENCES; Chung, Sung-Hoon; Bae, Chong-Woo; Bae, Chong-Woo; Chung, Sung-Hoon; Chung, Sung-Hoon",2017,JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE,10.3346/jkms.2017.32.8.1228,WOS:000405169100004,South Korea,"The survival rate (SR) of very low birth weight infants (VLBWIs) and extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWIs) is a health indicator of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) outcomes. The Korean Neonatal Network (KNN) was established in 2013, and a system has been launched to manage the registration and quality improvement of VLBWIs. The SR of the VLBWIs significantly increased to 85.7% in the 2010s compared with 83.0% in the 2000s. There was also a significant increase in the SR of the ELBWIs from 66.1% to 70.7%. The equipment, manpower, and assistance systems of NICUs also improved in quantity and quality. In the international comparison of the SRs of VLBWIs, the SRs were 93.8%, 92.2%, 90.2%, 89.4%, 86.4%, 85.1%, and 80.6% in Japan, Australia and New Zealand, Canada, Europe, Korea, Taiwan, and United States, respectively. In conclusion, the SRs of the VLBWIs and ELBWIs improved in the 2010s compared with those in the 2000s in Korea. This improvement is considered to have been related to the role of the KNN built in 2013. However, the latest VLBWI and ELBWI SRs in 2015 are still low compared with those in Japan, Australia and New Zealand, Canada, and Europe.

If no special status is accorded to family physicians, however, then the rates at which health care recipients utilize their service might be affected. In the present cross-sectional study, representative claims data sets for 2010 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance program, a health care system in which beneficiaries are not required to register with a family physician, were used to investigate the provision of health care to the population by family physicians. Among 919 206 beneficiaries with a total of 13 713 199 ambulatory visits, 49.1% had visited family physicians, 34.1% had visited internists, 24.3% had visited pediatricians, and 38.9% had visited otolaryngologists. Women (chi(2)(1) = 538, P < .001) and patients aged 65 and above (chi(2)(1) = 16 000, P < .001) had a higher proportion of visiting family physicians rather than visiting other specialties. The onion-shaped population pyramid with family medicine visits was compatible with the general population, and the proportion of visiting family physicians increased with increasing age. Among 112 289 patients with essential hypertension, 63 379 patients with diabetes mellitus, and 80 090 patients with hyperlipidemia, only 35.3%, 32.0%, and 31.1%, respectively, had visited family physicians. The age and sex distributions of these patients were illustrated with population pyramids for data visualization and direct comparisons. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that the utilization of family physicians in Taiwan and the effectiveness of their associated role in chronic disease management still have room for improvement.",0,0,ambulatory care; chronic disease; family physicians; national health programs; population pyramid; UNITED-STATES; INSURANCE; PEDIATRICIANS; SERVICES; CHILDREN; VISITS,Article

The aims of the study were to evaluate trends of opioid consumption for pain management in Taiwan and compare them among neighboring Asian countries. Opioid consumption data, including fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, codeine, and pethidine, were collected from the Controlled Drugs Management Information System of Taiwan Food and Drug Administration from 2008 to 2018. Data of different continents and neighboring Asian countries were retrieved from the WHO website. The major findings include: (1) In Taiwan, the total annual opioid consumption has gradually increased from 2008 to 2018, with fentanyl being the most frequently consumed opioid analgesic, followed by morphine. Codeine and pethidine consumption dropped significantly over the years. (2) In neighboring Asian countries, the opioid consumption in order from highest to lowest consumption were South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong (China), and China. We concluded that, from 2008 to 2018, the total opioid consumption trend for pain management in Taiwan has slowly increased, with fentanyl and morphine being the most commonly used opioids. When compared with neighboring Asian countries, level of opioid consumption in Taiwan was between Japan and Singapore.

Differences in trends of perceived inpatient care quality based on regional socioeconomic level in the United States and Taiwan,"Yoon, Grace H.; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; WILEY; Yoon, Grace H.; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Yoon, Grace H.; CHENG, SHOU-HSIA",2021,HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,10.1111/1475-6773.13872,WOS:000716446600013,Taiwan,"Objective To examine perceived inpatient care quality according to regional socioeconomic status (SES), measured by regional household income, across the United States and Taiwan. Data sources Patient Experience in Hospital Care (PEHC) survey 2018-2019 data from National Taiwan University; US Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) 2018-2019 data from ; and household income and facility data from publicly accessible databases. Study design This retrospective study used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the effect of household income on the rate of positive inpatient experiences in Taiwan and the United States, adjusting for hospitals' teaching status and ownership, and physician density. Data collection Hospital administrators for HCAHPS and PEHC's research teams invited patients who received inpatient care during the data collection period in the United States and Taiwan, respectively. The analysis included 1024 facilities from nine US states and 350 facilities from twenty major cities/counties in Taiwan. Principal findings Perceived inpatient care quality was higher in the United States than in Taiwan for the three experience measures. In Taiwan, hospitals with higher regional SES were less likely to receive a highly positive response for perceived respect, accommodation quality, and understanding upon discharge, with odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.83 to 0.88. In contrast, in the United States, higher regional SES was associated with a higher likelihood of a positive response for accommodation quality and understanding upon discharge (ORs = 2.51 and 1.48). Regional physician density and individual hospital characteristics show varying effects on perceived quality between Taiwan and the United States. Conclusions Higher overall experience scores in the United States are consistent with higher spending on health care compared with Taiwan. Varying associations between regional SES and perceived inpatient care quality highlight how systemic and cultural differences between the two countries affect scoring patterns.",1,0,inpatient care; international comparison; patient satisfaction; quality of care; socioeconomic status; HEALTH-CARE; PATIENT-SATISFACTION; COST; PRICES,Article

However, the emergence of new psychoactive substances (NPSs) poses a new risk to public health and a challenge to drug policy because of their unknown toxicological effects and easy modification of chemical structures to shun legal control. So far, there is no international consensus on legislative control of NPSs. Therefore, we compared the legislative management on NPS control among Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. Drug-related information was obtained from the authorities of these three countries. The results indicate that despite geographic proximity and similar legal attitudes toward illegal drug use, the legislative criteria, and responses for NPS control in these three countries were quite different. Ketamine has been the major used NPS in Taiwan but seldom found in South Korea and Japan. The difference in the number of controlled NPSs in Taiwan (91) and South Korea (245) might be due to the implementation of temporary designation systems and analog controls in South Korea. The recent surge of newly controlled NPSs in Japan was because of the promulgation of designated drug regulation and subsequent control of ""dangerous drugs."" Although NPS use has become a potential social and medical problem among these three countries, the outcomes of NPS legislation control remain to be scrutinized. To minimize harm from NPS use, development of legislative mechanism(s) on NPS scheduling is the first step for early identification and control of NPS problems.",0,0,Japan; new psychoactive substance (NPS) legislation; South Korea; Taiwan; DRUG-ABUSE; PREVALENCE,Article

Nevertheless, there have been few studies focusing on the strengthening of primary healthcare in Chinese health system. Design This study was a longitudinal observational study. Primary and secondary outcome measures The data of this study came from China Health Statistical Yearbook (2009-2018). We evaluated the development of primary healthcare based on the absolute values of health resources allocation and health service provision and evaluated the status of primary healthcare throughout the health system based on the composition ratios of the indicators across the health system. The Cochran-Armitage trend test and linear trend test were used to identify the indicators' trends over time. Results From 2009 to 2018, the amounts of health resources allocation and health service provision of Chinese primary healthcare institutions showed a significant upward trend (p<0.001). However, compared with the indicators in 2009, excepting that the proportion of grants from the government in the whole health system has an upward trend, the proportions of other indicators had an escalating trend in 2018 by 3.66% for practicing (assistant) physicians, by 2.69% for nurses, by 3.99% for total revenues, by 5.87% for beds, by 8.39% for outpatient visits. Conclusion The primary healthcare system has developed rapidly, but its development speed lagged behind the entire health system, resulting in the weakening of its actual functions, which is not in line with the goal of health reform. The government should be more aware of the importance of primary healthcare at all levels of local governments and ensure adequate financial input.",0,0,health policy; primary care; organisational development; SYSTEM; PROGRESS,Article

The objective of this study was to investigate the epidemiology, use of interventional procedures, and outcomes for older females and males hospitalized with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in 6 diverse countries.METHODS:We conducted a serial cross-sectional cohort study of 1 508 205 adults aged >= 66 years hospitalized with STEMI and NSTEMI between 2011 and 2018 in the United States, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and Israel using administrative data. We compared females and males within each country with respect to age-standardized hospitalization rates, rates of cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 90 days of hospitalization, and 30-day age- and comorbidity-adjusted mortality.RESULTS:Hospitalization rates for STEMI and NSTEMI decreased between 2011 and 2018 in all countries, although the hospitalization rate ratio (rate in males/rate in females) increased in virtually all countries (eg, US STEMI ratio, 1.58:1 in 2011 and 1.73:1 in 2018; Israel NSTEMI ratio, 1.71:1 in 2011 and 2.11:1 in 2018). Rates of cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery were lower for females than males for STEMI in all countries and years (eg, US cardiac catheterization in 2018, 88.6% for females versus 91.5% for males; Israel percutaneous coronary intervention in 2018, 76.7% for females versus 84.8% for males) with similar findings for NSTEMI. Adjusted mortality for STEMI in 2018 was higher for females than males in 5 countries (the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Israel, and Taiwan) but lower for females than males in 5 countries for NSTEMI.CONCLUSIONS:We observed a larger decline in acute myocardial infarction hospitalizations for females than males between 2011 and 2018. Females were less likely to receive cardiac interventions and had higher mortality after STEMI.
