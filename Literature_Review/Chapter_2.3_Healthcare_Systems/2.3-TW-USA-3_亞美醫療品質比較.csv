Multi-disciplinary anticoagulation management services have been shown to be cost-effective in the United States, Hong Kong and Thailand, but the findings are not readily generalizable to Singapore's healthcare system. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist-managed anticoagulation clinic (ACC) compared with usual care (UC) for the management of older adults with AF receiving oral anticoagulation with warfarin. Setting Pharmacist-managed ACC in an academic medical centre. Method A Markov model with 3-month cycle length and 30-year time horizon compared costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of ACC and UC from the patient's and healthcare provider's perspectives. Four pathways based on time in therapeutic range (TTR) were: ACC TTR < 70 %, ACC TTR aeyen 70 %, UC TTR < 70 % and UC TTR aeyen 70 %. A hypothetical cohort of 70-year-old Singaporean AF patients receiving warfarin was utilised. Local data from national disease registries, patient surveys and hospital databases were used. When local data was not available, published studies on Asian populations were utilized when available. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainties. Costs and QALYs were discounted annually by 3 %. Main outcome measure Costs and QALYs of ACC and UC. Results Pharmacist-managed ACC was found to dominate UC in all comparisons. It improved effectiveness by 0.19 and 0.13 QALYs at TTR < 70 % and TTR aeyen 70 % respectively compared with UC. From the patient's perspective, ACC reduced costs by SG$1222.67 (a,not sign1110.24) for TTR < 70 % and SG$1008.16 (a,not sign915.46) for TTR aeyen 70 %. Similar trends were observed from the healthcare provider's perspective, with ACC reducing costs by SG$1444.79 (a,not sign1311.94) for TTR < 70 % and SG$1269.17 (a,not sign1152.46) for TTR aeyen 70 % compared with UC. The results were robust to variations of the parameters over their plausible ranges in one-way sensitivity analyses. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that ACC was cost-effective more than 79 % of the time from both perspectives at a willingness-to-pay threshold of SG$69,050 (a,not sign62,701) per QALY. Conclusion Pharmacist-managed ACC is more effective and less costly compared with UC regardless of the quality of anticoagulation therapy. The findings support the current body of evidence demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of ACC.",1,0,Anticoagulation; Atrial fibrillation; Cost-effectiveness; Pharmacist; Singapore; Warfarin; WARFARIN THERAPY MANAGEMENT; LONG-TERM PROGNOSIS; STROKE PREVENTION; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ASIAN PATIENTS; RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; RECURRENCE; HEMORRHAGE; DABIGATRAN,Article

The UAS serves as a social and health sciences infrastructure for collecting data on the daily lives of US families and individuals. The collected information includes survey data, DNA from saliva samples, information from wearables, contextual and administrative linkages, ecological momentary assessments, self-recorded narratives and electronic records of financial transactions. The information collected focuses on a defining challenge of our time-identifying factors explaining racial, ethnic, geographic and socioeconomic disparities over the life course, including racial discrimination, inequalities in access to education and healthcare, differences in physical, economic and social environments, and, more generally, the various opportunities and obstacles one encounters over the life course. The UAS infrastructure aims to optimise engagement with the wider research community both in data dissemination and in soliciting input on content and methods. To encourage input from the research community, we have reserved 100 000 min of survey time per year for outside researchers, who can propose to add survey questions four times a year.Participants The UAS currently comprises about 15 000 US residents (including a 3500-person California oversample) recruited by Address-Based Sampling and provided with Internet-enabled tablets if needed. Surveys are conducted in English and Spanish.Findings to date Since the founding of the UAS in 2014, we have conducted more than 600 surveys, including a sequence of surveys collecting biennial information on health and retirement (the complete Health and Retirement Study instrument), 11 cognitive assessments, personality, knowledge and use of information on Social Security programme rules, work disability and subjective well-being. Several hundreds of papers have been published based on the collected data in the UAS. Studies include documentations of the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and how this varied across socioeconomic groups; comparisons of physical activity measured with accelerometers and by self-reports showing the dramatic biases in the latter; extensive studies have shown the power of using paradata in gauging cognitive change over time; several messaging experiments have shown the effectiveness of information provision on the quality of decision-making affecting well-being at older ages.Future plans The UAS national sample is planned to grow to 20 000 respondents by 2025, with subsamples of about 2500 African American, 2000 Asian and 3000 Hispanic participants and an oversample of rural areas. An increasing amount of non-interview data (contextual information, data from a suite of wearables and administrative linkages) is continually being added to the data files.",0,0,Aging; Information technology; Caregivers; Health Surveys; Surveys and Questionnaires; Internet; FACE-TO-FACE; INTERNET SURVEYS; PROBABILITY; ACCURACY; LIFE,Article

In this study, we determined whether the severity of symptoms (gastrointestinal, psychological distress), cognitive beliefs about irritable bowel syndrome, and life impacts (life interference, health-related quality of life) differ between Asian American and White American women with irritable bowel syndrome. We also look at the relationships among these variables. Asian American women (N = 21) and age- and design-matched White American women (N = 63) with irritable bowel syndrome were included. Data were collected from questionnaires and a 28-day daily diary (e.g., abdominal pain, depression). The percent of days with moderate/severe abdominal pain and psychological distress were significantly higher, and constipation- and diarrhea-dominant bowel pattern subtypes were prevalent in White Americans as compared with Asian Americans. Positive relationships of gastrointestinal symptoms with psychological distress, and of gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms with negative cognitive beliefs and negative life impact, were observed in White Americans. Further studies to evaluate contributing (e.g., cultural-environmental, pathophysiological, diet) factors of symptom characteristics in Asian Americans are suggested.

Melanoma accounts for a small percentage of skin cancer cases but is responsible for the majority of skin cancer deaths. Various imaging tests can be used with the aim of detecting metastatic spread of disease following a primary diagnosis of melanoma (primary staging) or on clinical suspicion of disease recurrence (re-staging). Accurate staging is crucial to ensuring that patients are directed to the most appropriate and effective treatment at different points on the clinical pathway.

METHODS: 2006-2019 American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program files were queried for all patients who underwent a craniotomy for a supratentorial glioma resection. Racial disparities in preoperative variables were studied between the demographic cohorts of Asian, African Americans, Hispanics, and Caucasian. Fisher exact tests were used to examine association of preoperative variables with race. Multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for all preoperative variables associated with race, were used to determine the odds ratios of postoperative outcomes for each demographic cohort in comparison with Caucasian patients. RESULTS: A total of 12,544 patients were identified: 4% Asian, 5% African American, 7% Hispanic, and 85% Caucasian. African American patients had significantly higher adjusted odds than Caucasian patients of major adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.827, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.155-2.891, P = 0.01), pulmonary events (aOR: 1.683, 95% CI: 1.145-2.473, P = 0.008), and urinary tract infection (aOR: 2.016, 95% CI: 1.221-3.327, P = 0.006). Asian patients had significantly higher odds than Caucasian patients of requiring a transfusion (aOR: 2.094, 95% CI: 1.343-3.266, P = 0.001). All demographic cohorts had higher odds of having an extended length of stay than Caucasian patients.

Methods An electronic literature search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and EconLit was conducted for studies of the cost and HCRU outcomes of RSV infection in adult patients, with no language or country restrictions. The search dates for the primary studies were January 1, 2002-May 18, 2022. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using a modification of the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist for economic studies and the Drummond checklist. Results Forty-two studies were identified that reported cost or HCRU data associated with RSV infections, with geographic locations across North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Oceania. Generally, hospitalization costs were highest in the United States (US). Driving factors of increased cost included older age, comorbidities, and length of stay. US studies found that the national direct cost burden of RSV hospitalizations was $1.3 billion for all adults and $1.5-$4.0 billion for adults aged >= 60 years (estimates for other countries were not identified). Studies estimating incremental costs for RSV cases versus controls and costs pre- and post-RSV infection demonstrated higher costs for RSV cases. Hospitalizations accounted for the majority of total costs. Evidence Limitations and Gaps The variability in definitions of cost outcomes, age groups, study seasons, and geographic locations was prohibitive of a meta-analysis and comparisons across studies. Cost and HCRU data were limited per country outside the US, per comorbidity, and in settings other than the inpatient setting. Only one study reported indirect costs, and only the US had national cost burden data. Conclusion Despite several data gaps, the economic burden of RSV infections on healthcare systems and payers was found to be substantial, globally, underscoring the need for RSV preventive strategies for reducing this burden.",0,0,Respiratory syncytial virus; respiratory infection; economic burden; cost; healthcare resource utilization; adults; UNITED-STATES; OLDER-ADULTS; VIRAL-INFECTIONS; INFLUENZA-VIRUS; MORTALITY; HOSPITALIZATIONS; SEASONALITY; MORBIDITY; PREVENTION; DISEASE,Review
