However, it also has the unintended consequence of requiring substantial time and resources from genetic counselors who need to obtain licensure in multiple states. There is a wide range of variability among state licensure applications, required supporting documentation, verification processes, and cost-all of which are barriers for genetic counselors. New licensure laws are being passed on a regular basis, further complicating this process. Resources may be available to some genetic counselors such as employer reimbursement and administrative support; however, access to this support is not universal.

"RULE OF REASON WITHOUT A RHYME: USING ""BIG DATA"" TO BETTER ANALYZE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATIONS UNDER THE MEDICARE SHARED SAVINGS PROGRAM","Werbelow, Shaun E.; NEW YORK UNIV SCHOOL LAW",2015,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW,,WOS:000353077100008,,"Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), a major component of the Affordable Care Act, seek to provide patients with better quality health care at a lower cost and have been praised for their ability to help repair our country's broken health care system. Despite their potential benefits, however, ACOs also raise significant antitrust concerns concerns that may pit consumer surplus and total surplus against one another. In an attempt to address these concerns, the Department of Justice and Fair Trade Commission announced that they will use market share screens and rule of reason treatment to evaluate ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. The use of market share screens and rule of reason treatment allows the antitrust agencies to avoid prioritizing either consumer surplus, or total surplus in the first instance but leaves open two critical questions: What will the rule of reason treatment afforded to ACOs look like? And how will the antitrust agencies ultimately determine whether ACOs benefit or harm consumers? In order to address these questions, this Note proposes that the antitrust agencies use the ""big data"" collected under the Affordable Care Act to conduct a structured rule of reason review of ACOs that takes into account both the consumer surplus and total surplus through a burden-shifting framework.",0,0,HEALTH-CARE; ANTITRUST; HOSPITALS; EFFICIENCY; WELFARE; MERGERS; PROFIT; REFORM; GOALS; LAW,Article
The Impacts of Medicaid Expansion on Rural Low-Income Adults: Lessons From the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment,"Allen, Heidi; Wright, Bill; Broffman, Lauren; SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC; Allen, Heidi; Wright, Bill; Broffman, Lauren; Allen, Heidi",2018,MEDICAL CARE RESEARCH AND REVIEW,10.1177/1077558716688793,WOS:000432238900005,USA,"Medicaid expansions through the Affordable Care Act began in January 2014, but we have little information about what is happening in rural areas where provider access and patient resources might be more limited. In 2008, Oregon held a lottery for restricted access to its Medicaid program for uninsured low-income adults not otherwise eligible for public coverage. The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment used this opportunity to conduct the first randomized controlled study of a public insurance expansion. This analysis builds off of previous work by comparing rural and urban survey outcomes and adds qualitative interviews with 86 rural study participants for context. We examine health care access and use, personal finances, and self-reported health. While urban and rural populations have unique demographic profiles, rural populations appear to have benefited from Medicaid as much as urban. Qualitative interviews revealed the distinctive challenges still facing low-income uninsured and newly insured rural populations.",0,0,medicaid; rural; access; Affordable Care Act; URBAN DISPARITIES; UNITED-STATES; CARE; ACCESS; US; PATTERNS; QUALITY; STAGE; AREAS,Article
Cost-Effectiveness of Combination of Baricitinib and Remdesivir in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in the United States: A Modelling Study,"Kelton, Kari; Klein, Tim; Murphy, Dan; Belger, Mark; Hille, Erik; McCollam, Patrick L.; Spiro, Theodore; Burge, Russel; SPRINGER; Kelton, Kari; Klein, Tim; Murphy, Dan; Hille, Erik; Belger, Mark; McCollam, Patrick L.; Spiro, Theodore; Burge, Russel; Burge, Russel; Burge, Russel; Burge, Russel; Hille, Erik Darwin; Burge, Russel",2022,ADVANCES IN THERAPY,10.1007/s12325-021-01982-6,WOS:000721404200001,USA,"Introduction Baricitinib-remdesivir (BARI-REM) combination is superior to remdesivir (REM) in reducing recovery time and accelerating clinical improvement among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), specifically those receiving high-flow oxygen/noninvasive ventilation. Here we assessed the cost-effectiveness of BARI-REM versus REM in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the USA. Methods A three-state model was developed addressing costs and patient utility associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, immediate post hospital care, and subsequent lifetime medical care. Analysis was performed from the perspective of a payer and a hospital. Both perspectives evaluated two subgroups: all patients and patients who required oxygen. The primary measures of benefit in the model were patient quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued during and after hospitalization, cost per life years gained, cost per death avoided, and cost per use of mechanical ventilation avoided. Results In the base-case payer perspective with a lifetime horizon, treatment with BARI-REM versus REM resulted in an incremental total cost of $7962, a gain of 0.446 life years and gain of 0.3565 QALYs over REM. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of using BARI-REM were estimated as $22,334 per QALY and $17,858 per life year. The base-case and sensitivity analyses showed that the total incremental cost per QALY falls within the reduced willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY applied under health emergencies. In all hospitalized patients, treatment with BARI-REM versus REM reduced total hospital expenditures per patient by $1778 and total reimbursement payments by $1526, resulting in a $252 reduction in net costs per patient; it also resulted in a net gain of 0.0018 QALYs and increased survival of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 2.7%. Conclusion Our study showed that BARI-REM is cost-effective compared to using REM for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The base-case results of this cost-effectiveness model were most sensitive to average annual medical costs for recovered patients.",0,0,Baricitinib; Remdesivir; COVID-19; Cost-effectiveness; Hospital; Mechanical ventilation; METABOLIC SYNDROME; HEALTH,Article

Data Sources and Study Setting 2017 Oregon Medicaid claims from the Oregon Health Authority and electronic health records (EHR) from OCHIN, a clinical data research network, were used. Study Design We cross-sectionally assessed Hispanic-White, Black-White, and Asian-White disparities in 22 quality and utilization measures, comparing self-reported race and ethnicity to imputed values from the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) algorithm. Data Collection Race and ethnicity were obtained from self-reported data and imputed using BISG. Principal Findings 42.5%/4.9% of claims/EHR were missing self-reported data; BISG estimates were available for >99% of each and had good concordance (0.87-0.95) with Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White self-report. All estimated racial and ethnic disparities were statistically similar in self-reported and imputed EHR-based measures. However, within claims, BISG estimates and incomplete self-reported data yielded substantially different disparities in almost half of the measures, with BISG-based Black-White disparities generally larger than self-reported race and ethnicity data. Conclusions BISG imputation methods are feasible for Medicaid claims data and reduced missingness to <1%. Disparities may be larger than what is estimated using self-reported data with high rates of missingness.",0,0,Bayesian imputation; health care disparities; HEDIS; Medicaid; quality of health care; race factors; AFFORDABLE CARE ACT; INSURANCE-COVERAGE; HEALTH; ACCESS; RACE/ETHNICITY; IMPUTATION; IMPACT; RACE,Article

In mental health, Medicaid became the dominant source of funding and had a profound impact on the organization and delivery of services. But it played a much more modest role in addiction treatment. This is poised to change, as the Affordable Care Act is expected to dramatically expand Medicaid's role in financing addiction services. In this article we consider the different paths these two treatment systems have taken since 1965 and identify strategic lessons that the addiction treatment system might take from mental health's experience under Medicaid. These lessons include leveraging optional coverage categories to tailor Medicaid to the unique needs of the addiction treatment system, providing incentives to addiction treatment programs to create and deliver high-quality alternatives to inpatient treatment, and using targeted Medicaid licensure standards to increase the quality of addiction services.",0,0,SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; AFFORDABLE CARE ACT; TREATMENT PROGRAMS; UNITED-STATES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; ABUSE TREATMENT; MAINTENANCE; INSURANCE,Article

Academic health centers (AHCs), whose triple mission of clinical care, research, and education serves a critical role in the country's health care system, must adapt to this evolving environment. Doing so successfully, however, requires a broader understanding of the wide-ranging roles of the AHC. This article proposes a conceptual framework through which the triple mission is expanded along four new dimensions: health, innovation, community, and policy. Examples within the conceptual framework categories, such as the AHCs' safety net function, their contributions to local economies, and their role in right-sizing the health care workforce, illustrate how each of these dimensions provides a more robust picture of the modern AHC and demonstrates the value added by AHCs. This conceptual framework also offers a basis for developing new performance metrics by which AHCs, both individually and as a group, can be held accountable, and that can inform policy decisions affecting them. This closer examination of the myriad activities of modern AHCs clarifies their essential role in our health care system and will enable these institutions to evolve, improve, be held accountable for, and more fully serve the health of the nation.",0,0,HOSPITAL TEACHING INTENSITY; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; CARE; INTERVENTION; IMPROVEMENT; INNOVATION; MORTALITY; COMMUNITY; IMPACT,Article
