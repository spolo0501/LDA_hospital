Linking State Intervention and Health Equity Differently: The Universalization of Health Care in South Korea and Taiwan,"Yi, Ilcheong; Sohn, Hyuk-Sang; Kim, Taekyoon; INST KOREAN STUDIES; Yi, Ilcheong; Sohn, Hyuk-Sang; Sohn, Hyuk-Sang; Kim, Taekyoon; Sohn, Hyuk-Sang; Sohn, Hyuk-Sang; Yi, Ilcheong; Yi, Ilcheong",2015,KOREA OBSERVER,,WOS:000362156200004,Switzerland; South Korea,"This study sets out to compare the process of the universalization of health insurance in South Korea and Taiwan, with a particular focus on the similarities of the commercial elements, such as the dominance of a private provider and user fees. What were both the constraints on, and the challenges to government policies to establish universal health insurance with commercial elements? Are there differences between the cases of these two countries? If there are, what caused those differences? What role have the state, market and civil society institutions played in shaping the health systems of these countries? To answer these questions, this paper analyzes the roles of historical institutional legacies, competitive election, active civil society, the education of doctors and nurses, the allocation of medical human resources in the labor market, the medical device industry, public and private hospitals and inter-sectoral policy measures, with a focus on the linkages within and between the health system and other sectors. It is fair to argue that the different modes of government interventions in various sectors and their varying degrees, in terms of enforcement, resulted in the universal health systems of the two countries being qualitatively different, and resulted in different consequences as regards health equity.",5,0,Universalization; Health System; National Health Insurance; State Intervention; Transformative Social Policy,Article

Examining sociopolitical elements of health system reform: The experience of Singapore and Taiwan,"Yeh, Ming-Jui; Serrano, Ray; WILEY; Yeh, Ming-Jui; Serrano, Ray; Yeh, Ming-Jui; Yeh, Ming-Jui",2020,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,10.1002/hpm.2955,WOS:000496697900001,USA,"This essay suggests five sociopolitical dimensions that influence the success of health system reforms. It examines the experience of two high-income Asian countries, Singapore and Taiwan, and illustrates how these five dimensions matter. These five sociopolitical dimensions are public trust, perceived government performance, political legitimacy, equity/solidarity, and demand for choice. Public trust in government, perceived government performance, and the legitimacy of political authorities were necessary for governments in both countries to enact key reforms. Public perceptions of government capacity combined with public conceptions of equity were deliberated and clarified as stakeholders sought to reach consensus based on values upheld by segments of each society. Nevertheless, these elements alone are not enough to sustain major institutional reforms in light of ongoing social, political, and demographic changes. This essay provides a different approach to traditional policy cycle models and seeks to emphasize stewardship and governance in health systems.",0,0,Health systems; Political Science; Singapore; Sociology; Taiwan; PUBLIC TRUST; CARE; GOVERNMENT; SOLIDARITY,Article
Inferences of waste management policy and reduction of marine debris in Southern Taiwan,"Yang, H-T; Chao, H-R; Cheng, Y-F; SPRINGER; Yang, H-T; Chao, H-R; Yang, H-T; Cheng, Y-F; Yang, H-T; Yang, H-T",2023,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,10.1007/s13762-022-04082-2,WOS:000774667600001,Taiwan,"Increasing marine debris destroys the aesthetic beauty of seashores and causes high potential risks to marine life and human health. In this study, marine debris was investigated along the Southern coastline of Taiwan at 26 spots, including seashores and fish ports at three different geography types in all four seasons after the neap and spring ides during June-2018-May-2019. The debris density was determined using the Strip Transect Method, and the coordinates were recorded using the Global Positioning System (GPS). Composition and sources of debris were also assessed, and the results of 48 surveys at 6 experimental sites were compared with the National Marine Debris Monitoring Program (NMDMP) of US EPA. Total 9313 waste items were recorded, and it was observed that debris concentration varied a lot with a change in location and geography type, whereas the change in seasons and tide types showed an insignificant difference. Overall results showed that more debris were found on rocky shores than fishing spots and sandy beaches. Plastic was the major contributor along with recreational activities as a major debris source. This survey suggests increasing the cleaning rate, following plastic-use-reducing policy, and promoting public awareness through proper education and the establishment of a debris monitoring system. It was also observed that waste management policy influences marine debris concentration, so proper management and laws could help overcome this issue.",0,0,Waste management; Marine debris; Strip transect method; Debris density; Debris composition; Debris source; NORTHWESTERN HAWAIIAN-ISLANDS; POLLUTION; QUANTITY; LITTER; BEACH,Article
The influence of medical cost controls implemented by Taiwan's national health insurance program on doctor-patient relationships,"Chiu, Jhih-Ling; WILEY-BLACKWELL; Chiu, Jhih-Ling",2015,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,10.1002/hpm.2256,WOS:000351394800006,Taiwan,"To prevent medical costs from rising, the National Health Insurance administration implemented the global budget system for financial reform, effective 1 July 2004. Since the implementation of this system, patients have been required to pay for some medicines to limit costs to the system. More recently, as they have faced constant increases in health insurance fees and also faced an increase in the number of medical expenses they must pay during an economic recession and a rise in unemployment, would the economic burden on the people of Taiwan not be increased? Even though National Health Insurance is a form of social insurance, does it guarantee social equality? The value of the healthcare industry is irreplaceable, so the most critical concern is whether worsening doctor-patient relationships will worsen healthcare quality. In short, while the global budget system saves on National Health Insurance costs, whether its implementation has affected healthcare quality is also worth exploring. This commentary also hopes to serve as a reference for the implementation of national health insurance in the United States.

In addition, a total of 15,253 COVID-19 related deaths were re-ported. During these three years, the government and health authority did many efforts to response this pandemic. In the early pandemic, Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center was established in the early 2020 to organize associated resource, develop effective policy and implement strict intervention. In response to COVID-19 pandemic, many infection control policy and interventions, including universal mask wearing with increasing production of face mask, hand hygiene, border control, introduce of digital technology incorporating big data, quarantine of COVID-19 cases, travel and gathering restriction, were implemented. In the meanwhile, two COVID-19 vaccines, namely MVC-COV1901 and UB-612, have been developed under the support of government. Furthermore, MVC-COV1901 was taken into clinical practice after received emergency use approval. In addition, two traditional Chinese medicines, including NRICM101 and NRICM102 showed their promising effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and were recommended as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19. During the pandemic, the nonpharmacologic intervention help reduce many infectious diseases, especially for airborne/droplet-transmitted diseases. However, COVID-19 exhibited some adverse impacts on the healthcare systems, such as emergency medical service on out of hospital cardiac arrest, cancer screening, HIV screening and prevention services, and public health, namely the psychosocial status of healthcare workers. Although the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infections may gradually subsided, we should keep monitoring its associated impact and appropriately response to this pandemic.

A Solidaristic Approach to Workers' Compensation Reform in Taiwan,"Yeh, Ming-Jui; OXFORD UNIV PRESS; Yeh, Ming-Jui; Yeh, Ming-Jui; Yeh, Ming-Jui",2019,PUBLIC HEALTH ETHICS,10.1093/phe/phz005,WOS:000510750500005,USA,"The workers' compensation system in Taiwan cannot provide sufficient coverage for all workers. This essay adopts a solidaristic approach to address this issue by analyzing the reasons why workers' compensation is underdeveloped in Taiwan and what could be done to persuade more key actors to support the reform for a more just policy arrangement. First, through comparison with the healthcare system, it is argued that the lack of solidarity and the perception of relevant similarities could explain the underdevelopment of workers' compensation. Second, the essay turns to the normative aspect of the issue. Compared with other normative political theories, Iris M. Young's social connection model provides specific normative guidance that is useful for justifying the allocation of responsibility for a more just workers' compensation reform.",0,0,HEALTH-INSURANCE; RETURN MIGRANTS; RIGHTS; INJURIES,Article

Data on the cancer-related mortality rates between 2005 and 2018 reported in the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan were obtained. The effect of hospice and palliative care enrollment at different timepoints before death on healthcare utilization was explored. This retrospective cohort study included 605,126 patients diagnosed with terminal cancer between 2005 and 2018; the percentage of patients receiving hospice and palliative care before death increased annually. Terminal cancer patients who enrolled in hospice and palliative care at different timepoints before death received higher total morphine doses; the difference in the total morphine doses between the two groups decreased as the time to death shortened. The difference in the total morphine doses between the groups gradually decreased from 2005 to 2018.

Assessing Taiwan's pay-for-performance program for diabetes care: a cost-benefit net value approach,"Lu, Jui-fen Rachel; Chen, Ying Isabel; Eggleston, Karen; Chen, Chih-Hung; Chen, Brian; SPRINGER; Lu, Jui-fen Rachel; Lu, Jui-fen Rachel; Lu, Jui-fen Rachel; Chen, Ying Isabel; Eggleston, Karen; Eggleston, Karen; Chen, Chih-Hung; Chen, Brian; Chen, Brian; Eggleston, Karen; Chen, Brian",2023,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,10.1007/s10198-022-01504-3,WOS:000842886400001,Taiwan; USA,"Pay-for-Performance (P4P) to better manage chronic conditions has yielded mixed results. A better understanding of the cost and benefit of P4P is needed to improve program assessment. To this end, we assessed the effect of a P4P program using a quasi-experimental intervention and control design. Two different intervention groups were used, one consisting of newly enrolled P4P patients, and another using P4P patients who have been enrolled since the beginning of the study. Patient-level data on clinical indicators, utilization and expenditures, linked with national death registry, were collected for diabetic patients at a large regional hospital in Taiwan between 2007 and 2013. Net value, defined as the value of life years gained minus the cost of care, is calculated and compared for the intervention group of P4P patients with propensity score-matched non-P4P samples. We found that Taiwan's implementation of the P4P program for diabetic care yielded positive net values, ranging from $40,084 USD to $348,717 USD, with higher net values in the continuous enrollment model. Our results suggest that the health benefits from P4P enrollment may require a sufficient time frame to manifest, so a net value approach incorporating future predicted mortality risks may be especially important for studying chronic disease management. Future research on the mechanisms by which the Taiwan P4P program helped improve outcomes could help translate our findings to other clinical contexts.",0,0,Pay-for-performance; National Health Insurance; Diabetes; Net value; Taiwan; HEALTH-CARE; QUALITY,Article
Assessing quality of primary diabetes care in South Korea and Taiwan using avoidable hospitalizations,"Kim, Hongsoo; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD; Kim, Hongsoo; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Kim, Hongsoo",2018,HEALTH POLICY,10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.09.009,WOS:000450380800011,South Korea; Taiwan,"Quality of primary diabetes care is a key health policy concern in many OECD countries with an aging population. This cross-national, population-based study examined the extent and attributes of diabetes related avoidable hospitalizations (DRAHs) in South Korea and Taiwan, both of which have social health insurance-based health systems with limited gate-keeping for hospitalizations. We analyzed comparable, nationally representative health insurance beneficiary datasets for the two countries (2002-2013), linked with community health resource data. The age- and sex-standardized DRAH rates were calculated, and multivariate, multi-level longitudinal modeling approaches were adopted. The DRAH rate decreased in Taiwan consistently during 2002-2013 and in Korea after 2011 only. Under the universal health coverage, people enjoyed high accessibility to care. A higher number of physician visits reduced DRAHs in Korea but not in Taiwan. Socio-economic disparities in DRAHs still existed in both countries, especially in Taiwan. We found a different trajectory in two similar health systems for the selected health system performance indicator for primary diabetes care. This can be partly explained by different policy approaches to diabetes management in the two countries over the years. Necessary are policy efforts to improve the quality and equality of primary diabetes care and better control of hospital admissions in these two health systems that provide generous access to care at a low cost in East Asia.

Methods and Study Design: Participants from the Elderly Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (1999-2000) formed this cohort. Dietary information was collected by 24-hr recall and simplified food frequency questionnaire. Dietary quality was assessed by dietary diversity score (DDS, 0-6). Annual medical service utilization and expenditure were derived from National Health Insurance claims until 2006. Survivorship was ascertained from the National Death Registry until 2008. Cox proportional- hazards models were used to determine the association between aboriginality and mortality in conjunction with dietary diversity. Results: Indigenes (n=156) compared with nonindigenes (n=1182) significantly differed in socio-demography, behaviors and chronic disease prevalences. For up to 8 years, indigenes had a higher mortality rate (46.2% vs 33.6%, p=0.003). Indigenes' nutrient intakes were less for polyunsaturated fat, dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals (but more sodium); food intakes more for meat, with less cooking oil, dairy products and fruits; and a lower DDS, (3.61 vs 4.54). They had a 41% higher mortality risk (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.09-1.81, p=0.008). Control for demographic variables did not change the findings. However, the increase in HR was substantially attenuated by the inclusion of DDS (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88-1.49, p=0.316). There was no significant interaction between aboriginality and DDS on mortality (p=0.673). Conclusions: Older indigenous Taiwanese have a higher mortality risk than their majority counterparts. Irrespective of aboriginality, the more diverse diet is associated with a lower risk of mortality.",0,0,Indigenous; mortality; dietary diversity; Taiwan; NAHSIT; HEART-FAILURE HOSPITALIZATION; HEALTH; DISEASE; DETERMINANTS; EXPENDITURE; AUSTRALIA; SURVIVAL; QUALITY; PEOPLES,Article

This system utilizes a nonlitigation expert review process to evaluate drug-injury relief applications, and 2,732 applications have been reviewed from 1999-2016. Of these, 1,572 applications received relief payments, an approval rate of 58%. Average review timeframes per application have decreased from 248 days (2003-2011) to 182 days (2012-2016). Most adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for approved cases involved skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (67%), with allopurinol being the primary culprit drug. A recent decline observed for such ADRs may reflect the influences of promotional activities and policy initiatives carried out according to informed analysis from drug-injury relief applications, which suggests that the drug-injury relief system can also play an important public health role in enhancing drug safety.",0,0,,Review
