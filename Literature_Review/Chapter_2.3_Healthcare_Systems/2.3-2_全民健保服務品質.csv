Therefore, this article carries out a systematic review using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta -Analysis) to draw inferences and generate evidences with respect to the influence of cash transfers on two aspects of human capital outcomes of children, viz., child health and nutrition, and educational outcomes in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Forty four studies were selected on the basis of a four-stage procedure that checked for identification, screening, eligi-bility and inclusion. The results indicate that majority of cash transfers based on conditionalities, like mandatory attendance in healthcare organisations and educational institutions, proved to be effective in the selected countries. While 7 studies (16%) showed no changes in the outcomes, 5 (11%) depicted negative impact and the rest (73%) presented a positive result. The selected studies suggest that a strong supply-side mechanism in place in LMICs, ensure functional and quality services at health centres and schools in the respective regions and reflect overwhelming outcomes. Furthermore, incentive design, anticipated termination, and supply-side interventions would be instrumental in avoiding a crisis or shock in the economic sense to recipient households.",0,0,Cash transfers; Education; Child health; Malnutrition; Systematic review; Low; and middle -income countries; TRANSFER PROGRAM; SCHOOL ENROLLMENT; INFANT-MORTALITY; IMPACT; HEALTH; MEXICO; MALNUTRITION; HOUSEHOLD; NUTRITION; COUNTRIES,Review
Determinants of rural-urban differential in healthcare utilization among the elderly population in India,"Banerjee, Shreya; BMC; Banerjee, Shreya; Banerjee, Shreya; Banerjee, Shreya",2021,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,10.1186/s12889-021-10773-1,WOS:000656207000014,India,"BackgroundPopulation aging poses a demographic burden on a country such as India with inadequate social security systems and very low public investment in health sector. This challenge of accelerated demographic transition is coupled by the rural-urban disparity in access to healthcare services among the elderly people in India. An important objective of India's National Health Policy (2017) is to ""progressively achieve universal health coverage"" which is posited upon mitigating the sub-national disparity that necessitates identifying the drivers of the disparity for targeted policy intervention. This study, therefore, makes an attempt towards the exploration of the prominent contributory factors behind the rural-urban gap in utilisation of healthcare among the older population in India.MethodsThe analysis has been done by using the unit level data of Social Consumption: Health (Schedule number 25.0) of the 75th round of the National sample Survey conducted during July 2017-June 2018. Two binary logistic models have been proposed to capture the crude and the adjusted association between health seeking behaviour and place of residence (rural/ urban). To compute the group differences (between rural and urban) in the rate of healthcare utilization among the elderly population in India and to decompose these differences into the major contributing factors, Fairlie's decomposition method has been employed.ResultsThe logistic regression models established a strong association between place of residence and likelihood of healthcare utilisation among the Indian elderly people. The results of the Fairlie's decomposition analysis revealed considerable rural-urban inequality disfavouring the rural residents and health care utilisation was found to be 7 percentage points higher among the older population residing in urban India than their rural counterparts. Level of education and economic status, both of which are indicators of a person's Socio-Economic Status, were the two major determinants of the existing rural-urban differential in healthcare utilisation, together explaining 41% of the existing rural-urban differential.ConclusionPublic health care provisions need to be strengthened both in terms of quality and outreach by way of greater public investments in the health sector and by building advanced health infrastructure in the rural areas. Implementation of poverty alleviation programmes and ensuring social-security of the elderly are also indispensable in bringing about equity in healthcare utilisation.",0,0,Rural-urban disparity; Elderly population; Health inequality; Decomposition analysis; Demographic burden; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; MORBIDITY; INEQUALITIES; EXPENDITURE; GENDER; EQUITY; LIFE,Article

This mixed methods systematic review assessed the effects of trauma-informed approaches on psychological, behavioural, and health outcomes in health-care providers and adult patients in primary care and community mental healthcare. We searched five databases and grey literature and consulted experts for reports published in January 1990 to June 2021. The quantitative descriptive and qualitative framework syntheses were integrated through a line of argument and mapped onto a logic model. We included six nonrandomised studies that evaluated eight interventions with varied theoretical developments, components, and outcomes. The most common components were budget allocation, workforce development, identification/response to violence and trauma, and evaluation. Evidence for intervention effects was limited and conflicting. Four studies reported improvement in provider readiness and sense of community, while three reported conflicting effects on provider behaviour regarding delivery of trauma-informed care. Four studies reported some improvement in patient readiness for disease management and access to services; however, the evidence for patient satisfaction was conflicting. Two studies found that patients and providers felt safe. While one study reported improvement in patient quality of life and chronic pain, another found no effect on substance use, and three studies reported conflicting effects on mental health. Intervention mechanisms included a package of varied components, tailoring to the organisational needs, capacities and preferences, staff education and self-care, creating safe environments, and shared decision-making. Intervention effects were moderated by contextual (health system values, policies, governance, business models, trauma-informed movement, organisational culture, and social determinants of health) and intervention factors (buy-in from all staff, collective learning through conversations, equal attention to staff and patient well-being, and sustainable funding). No studies measured adverse events/harm, cost effectiveness, or providers' health.

However, knowledge on the system-wide effectiveness of these reforms is limited. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the reforms' health and health system impacts. In 13 August 2022, international databases and three Chinese databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies and controlled before-after studies. Included studies assessed large-scale PHC policies since 2009; had a temporal comparator and a control group and assessed impacts on expenditures, utilization, care quality and health outcomes. Study quality was assessed using Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions, and results were synthesized narratively. From 49 174 identified records, 42 studies were included-all with quasi-experimental designs, except for one randomized control trial. Nine studies were assessed as at low risk of bias. Only five low- to moderate-quality studies assessed the comprehensive reforms as a whole and found associated increases in health service utilization, whilst the other 37 studies examined single-component policies. The National Essential Medicine Policy (N = 15) and financing reforms (N = 11) were the most studied policies, whilst policies on primary care provision (i.e. family physician policy and the National Essential Public Health Services) were poorly evaluated. The PHC reforms were associated with increased primary care utilization (N = 17) and improved health outcomes in people with non-communicable diseases (N = 8). Evidence on healthcare costs was unclear, and impacts on patients' financial burden and care quality were understudied. Some studies showed disadvantaged regions and groups that accrued greater benefits (N = 8). China's comprehensive PHC reforms have made some progress in achieving their policy objectives including increasing primary care utilization, improving some health outcomes and reducing health inequalities. However, China's health system remains largely hospital-centric and further PHC strengthening is needed to advance universal health coverage.",0,0,Primary health care; China; health reforms; policy evaluations; MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; PERCEIVED QUALITY; RATIONAL USE; MEDICINES; COVERAGE; PROGRESS; POLICY; PRESCRIPTION; COMMISSION; SHENZHEN,Review

In Cameroon, it is very common to find medically discharged patients who have received surgical treatment and are unable to pay the resulting bills. These patients can be held in detention in hospitals until payments are complete. Even the corpses of patients who die with unpaid medical bills can be withheld until their family members pay off the debt. While this practice has been ongoing for many y, there remains very little scholarship on the issue reported in the literature. The main objective of this study was to uncover the lived experiences of discharged patients residing in hospital detention for being unable to pay their medical bills.Methods: In-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and observations were conducted with purposefully selected patients living in detention in 2 rural private hospitals in the Fundong Health District in Cameroon. A thematic framework technique was used to analyze the transcribed data. The study was ethically approved by the Cameroon Bioethics Initiative, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.Results: Living in hospital detention after receiving treatment constitutes an economic, social, and psychological burden for patients. Economically, it exacerbated poverty for the patients unable to purchase food, medications, and clothing due to lack of jobs and financial support. Socially, many of these individuals suffered from isolation, loneliness, shame, stigma, risk of contracting other diseases, and precarious sleeping conditions. The psychological burden was comprised of stress, depression, trauma, nightmares, and suicidal thoughts. Conclusions: The experiences of discharged patients in hospital detention suggest that they live in very deplorable conditions. There is a need for a functional healthcare protection mechanism, such as universal health coverage, to reduce the cost of healthcare services and surgical operations. Alternative payment mechanisms should also be considered. (C) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Challenges and conditions for successfully implementing and adopting the telematics infrastructure in German outpatient healthcare: A qualitative study applying the NASSS framework,"Nordmann, Kim; Sauter, Stefanie; Redlich, Marie-Christin; Moebius-Lerch, Patricia; Schaller, Michael; Fischer, Florian; SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD; Nordmann, Kim; Sauter, Stefanie; Redlich, Marie-Christin; Moebius-Lerch, Patricia; Schaller, Michael; Fischer, Florian; Nordmann, Kim; Nordmann, Kim; Schneider, Stefan",2024,DIGITAL HEALTH,10.1177/20552076241259855,WOS:001277803100001,Germany,"Background Germany's healthcare system provides high-quality, universal health coverage to almost all residents. However, a major challenge lies in the strong separation of healthcare structures, which hinders efficient interprofessional and intersectoral communication and collaboration. The mandatory nationwide implementation of the telematics infrastructure may offer a solution to enhance healthcare professionals' communication and collaboration.Objective Our study aims to elicit participants' perceptions of and attitudes towards the implementation and usage of the telematics infrastructure in fostering interprofessional communication and collaboration between home-care nursing services and general practitioner practices.Methods We conducted interviews with seven members of general practitioner practices and 10 in home-care nursing services. Using thematic content analysis, we identified five themes, of which four along with 10 subthemes were integrated into Greenhalgh et al.'s 'nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread and sustainability' framework.Results Participants recognised the potential of digital technology to enhance interprofessional communication and collaboration. However, this potential largely depended on individual healthcare actors' willingness to seek information, invest and adapt. Attitudes towards the telematics infrastructure varied widely from hopeful confidence to outright rejection. Home-care nursing services generally viewed the telematics infrastructure with optimism, while general practitioners expressed reservations, particularly due to technological disruptions, lack of user-friendliness, and organisational structures.Conclusion Our findings highlight the potential of digital technology to enhance interprofessional communication. Successful implementation of technological innovations, however, goes beyond technological aspects and involves social, political and organisational processes. Future implementation strategies for such innovations in healthcare should involve users early and ensure clear communication.",0,0,Nurses; general practitioner; communication; collaboration; ambulant care; health telematics; eHealth strategy; INTERPROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT,Article

Objectives This study looks at the primary care attributes of AAMC from a patient perspective, to assess their features, strengths and weaknesses. Methods Using a primary care survey tool, a cross-sectional survey of 360 users was conducted at 18 facilities across 9 districts of Delhi to gather information on six dimensions of primary care delivery. Thematic analysis of responses to quantitative, multiple-choice and Likert scale questions using percentage of respondents in each category; and a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and suggestions (SWOS) framework, was used to examine the primary care attributes. Results AAMCs have done well in improving proximity, availability, physical and financial access to primary care with respondents reporting their residence within 1 kilometre of AAMCs (95%), physician being available (100%), free drugs in stock (99%). Service delivery is however not comprehensive with missing preventive care. Respondents reported missing gatekeeping, weak referral mechanism (6-19%), and low physician's familiarity with their overall health (2%). Conclusion AAMCs have brought affordable healthcare with free medicines and diagnostics to neighbourhood. There is an opportunity for attaining universal healthcare that is responsive to user needs through provision of comprehensive care.

Youth suicide rates declined gradually over the past two decades, but it is alarming to see that self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and attempts are quite common among junior secondary students. Local studies identify psychopathology (especially depression) and family relationship issues as the most common risk factors of suicide and self-harm, and impulsive control issues are an additional factor contributing to self-harm. In the second part, this paper reviews the evidence for six types of universal and selective prevention strategies identified from local and overseas literature: (1) restriction of access to means of suicide; (2) guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicides; (3) provision of quality mental healthcare to atrisk populations; (4) school-based screening and prevention programs; (5) online prevention, monitoring, and support programs; and (6) life skills training programs. Research evidence supports that the provision of high-quality mental health services to at-risk populations and some school-based prevention programs (awareness and screening, and gatekeeper training) are effective in suicide prevention. Further research efforts are needed to verify the impact of the other four strategies. Practitioners could make better use of new prevention programs through the internet and instant messaging platforms, which have the potential to alter attitude toward suicide and self-harm as well as promoting help seeking behavior among young people.

Breast cancer is a growing challenge in Thailand, as it is globally. It serves as a perfect medium through which to interrogate UHC and demonstrate areas of the health system which require further strengthening if UHC is to be sustainable in the longer term. We conducted a situation analysis and used a Systemic Rapid Assessment (SYSRA) framework to examine the challenges posed to UHC through the lens of breast cancer. We identified a number of challenges facing UHC including (1) continued political commitment; (2) the need for coordinated scale-up of strategic investments involving increased financing and fine-tuning of the allocation of resources according to health needs; (3) reducing inequities between health insurance schemes; (4) investing in innovation of technologies, and more critically, in technology transfer and capacity building; (5) increasing capacity, quality and confidence in the whole primary healthcare team but especially family medicine doctors. This would subsequently increase both efficiency and effectiveness of the patient pathway, as well as allow patients wherever possible to be treated close to their homes, work and family; (6) developing and connecting information systems to facilitate understanding of what is working, where needs are and track trends to monitor improvements in patient care. Our findings add to an existing body of evidence which suggest, in light of changing disease burden and increasing costs of care, a need for broader health system reforms to create a more enabling platform for integrated healthcare as opposed to addressing individual challenging elements one vertical system at a time. As low- and middle-income countries look to realize the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable UHC this analysis may provide input for policy discussion at national, regional and community levels and have applicability beyond breast cancer services alone and beyond Thailand.",0,0,Health system strengthening; universal healthcare; breast cancer; equity; challenges; MENTAL-HEALTH; SCALING-UP; COVERAGE; COUNTRIES; SURVIVAL; EXPERIENCE; MORTALITY; PAYMENTS,Article

The clear focus on the needs of those affected, which also includes relatives, and which often goes hand in hand with the omission of useless, unwanted, and often expensive diagnostic procedures and therapies, makes palliative care a highly economic form of care. In our healthcare system, which has been increasingly economized for decades, the question of whether something ""pays off"" is usually understood as whether the proceeds are favorable in relation to the costs by which profit can be made. However, especially in the German hospital system, it is easier to achieve surpluses with cost-intensive interventions than with a type of care in which the costs for staff account for the largest share. Therefore, the ""problem"" for business people is not that palliative medicine is too expensive, but rather that it is too cheap in certain areas. In general, no universal statement can be made about how lucrative specialized palliative care is. In particular, the outpatient and inpatient areas must be considered differently due to the different systems. Only in the case of multiprofessional palliative services in hospitals can it be stated that this increasingly important area is currently not regularly reimbursed to cover costs. On the other hand, palliative care units can be designed to cover costs and still ensure a high level of quality, especially if ""secondary profits"" are taken into account.",0,0,Palliative care unit; Inpatient palliative services; Outpatient palliative services; Funding; Efficiency,Article

Health professionals, including occupational therapists (OTs), need to consider health literacy in order to optimise client-centred interventions that promote self-management of chronic conditions, health and wellness. The goal of this small-scale cohort study was to determine if a health literacy workshop series for OTs could improve their working knowledge of health literacy, and increase their self-perceived ability to identify, assess and implement client-centred interventions to at-risk patients. Design: Over a 6-week period, six OT professionals participated in a customised workshop series, incorporating elements of the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Health Literacy Universal Precautions Toolkit (the Toolkit) and other AHRQ-supported health literacy resources. Method: A one-group, pre-posttest mixed methods design was used to measure outcomes. Results: Results of this study suggests that participation in a health literacy education programme featuring the Toolkit and other AHRQ-supported tools can improve OTs' self-perceived ability to identify, assess and provide client-centred services to their patients.

It investigates, in particular, changes in self-reported difficulties in accessing healthcare with regard to distance to health services, waiting times for appointments and the costs of seeing a doctor, and identifies particular risk factors that increase the likelihood of facing barriers in accessing health services. We conduct logistic regression analyses of cross-sectional data from the three rounds (2003, 2007, 2011) of the European Quality of Life Survey of 2682 individuals living in private households in Ireland. The study finds that the number of individuals reporting difficulties in accessing healthcare increased over time. Of particular concern are difficulties with the financial costs of covering doctor's appointments, which started to increase dramatically prior to the economic crisis and continued to rise during the crisis, in particular for higher income groups. Difficulties with distance and waiting time declined gradually over time and appear unaffected by the financial crisis, at least until 2011. Subgroups that face significantly more difficulties are women, younger individuals, the full-/part-time employed and individuals with poor health status.
