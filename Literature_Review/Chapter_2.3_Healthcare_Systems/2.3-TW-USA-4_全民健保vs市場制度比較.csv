"Breastfeeding practice, breastfeeding policy and hospitalisations for infectious diseases in early and later childhood: a register-based study in Uppsala County, Sweden","Videholm, Samuel; Wallby, Thomas; Silfverdal, Sven-Arne; BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP; Videholm, Samuel; Silfverdal, Sven-Arne; Wallby, Thomas; Videholm, Samuel; Videholm, Samuel; Silfverdal, Sven Arne; SILFVERDAL, Sven; Videholm, Samuel",2021,BMJ OPEN,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046583,WOS:000657356400008,Sweden,"Objective To examine the association between breastfeeding practice and hospitalisations for infectious diseases in early and later childhood, in particular, to compare exclusive breast feeding 4-5 months with exclusive breastfeeding 6 months or more. Thereby, provide evidence to inform breastfeeding policy. Design A register-based cohort study. Setting A cohort was created by combining the Swedish Medical Birth Register, the National Inpatient Register, the Cause of Death Register, the Total Population Register, the Longitudinal integration database for health insurance and labour market studies, with the Uppsala Preventive Child Health Care database. Patients 37 825 term and post-term singletons born to women who resided in Uppsala County (Sweden) between 1998 and 2010. Main outcome measures Number of hospitalisations for infectious diseases in early (<2 years) and later childhood (2-4 years). Results The risk of hospitalisations for infectious diseases decreased with duration of exclusive breastfeeding until 4 months of age. In early childhood, breast feeding was associated with a decreased risk of enteric and respiratory infections. In comparison with exclusive breast feeding 6 months or more, the strongest association was found between no breastfeeding and enteric infections (adjusted incidence rate ratios, aIRR 3.32 (95% CI 2.14 to 5.14)). In later childhood, breast feeding was associated with a lower risk of respiratory infections. In comparison with children exclusively breastfed 6 months or more, the highest risk was found in children who were not breastfed (aIRR 2.53 (95% CI 1.51 to 4.24)). The risk of hospitalisations for infectious diseases was comparable in children exclusively breastfed 4-5 months and children exclusively breastfed 6 months or more. Conclusions Our results support breastfeeding guidelines that recommend exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months.",0,0,infectious diseases; nutrition; public health; epidemiology; community child health,Article
Universal health coverage and equal access in Sweden: a century-long perspective on macro-level policy,"Fredriksson, Mio; BMC; Fredriksson, Mio; Fredriksson, Mio",2024,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH,10.1186/s12939-024-02193-5,WOS:001233940300001,Sweden,"Background When today's efforts to achieve universal health coverage are mainly directed towards low-income settings, it is perhaps easy to forget that countries considered to have universal, comprehensive and high-performing health systems have also undergone this journey. In this article, the aim is to provide a century-long perspective to illustrate Sweden's long and ongoing journey towards universal health coverage and equal access to healthcare.Methods The focus is on macro-level policy. A document analysis is divided into three broad eras (1919-1955; 1955-1989; 1989-) and synthesises seven points in time when policies relevant to overarching goals and regulation of universal health coverage and equal access were proposed and/or implemented. The development is analysed and concluded in relation to two egalitarian goals in the context of health: equality of access and equal treatment for equal need.Results Over the past century, macro-level policy evolved from the concept of creating access for the neediest and those reliant on wages for their survival to a mandatory insurance with equal right to healthcare for all. However, universal health coverage was not achieved until 1955, and individuals had to rely on their personal financial resources to cover the cost at the time of care utilization until the 1970s. It was not until 1983 that legislation explicitly stated that access to healthcare should be equal for the entire population (horizontal equity), while a vertical equity-principle was not added until 1997. Subsequently, ideas of free choice and privatization have gained significance. For instance, they aim to increase service access, addressing the Swedish health system's Achilles' heel in this regard. However, the principle of equal access for all is now being challenged by the emergence of private health insurance, which offers quicker access to services.Conclusions: brief summary and potential implications It can be concluded that there is no perpetual Swedish healthcare model and various dimensions of access have been the focus of policy discussion. The discussion on access barriers has shifted from financial to personal and organizational ones. Today, Sweden still ranks high in terms of affordability and equity in international comparisons: although not as well as a decade ago. Whether this marks the beginning of a new trend intertwined with a decline in Sweden's welfare 'exceptionalism', or is a temporary decline remains to be assessed in the future.",0,0,Universal health coverage; Equal access; Sweden; Swedish model; Horizontal equity; Vertical equity; WELFARE-STATE; CHOICE; CARE; EUROPE; EQUITY; WILL,Article

In order to implement the citizens' right to health, Korea has adopted national health insurance, in particular public methods, in which the state directly intervenes in the medical market. All Koreans are compulsorily enrolled in National Health Insurance, and pay their premiums in proportion to their income to the National Health Insurance Corporation. All medical institutions are also enforced in the national health insurance system. Under this system, anyone who needs medical care can receive universal basic medical treatment at low cost. National health insurance in Korea has institutionalized that, at the very least, it should not be deprived of even the least opportunity to enjoy health because of economic barriers. In Korea, the universal health insurance system has been accepted as natural because of the combination of solidarity and shared responsibility.",0,0,social state; right to health; national health insurance; solidarity; Obamacare; social insurance; federalism; fundamental right; CONSTITUTION; CARE,Article
Special medical outpatient care-3.5 years of outpatient specialist care in rheumatology An inventory,"Sollacher, Anna; Froschauer, Sonja; Bredow, Laura; Zinke, Silke; SPRINGER HEIDELBERG; Sollacher, Anna; Froschauer, Sonja; Bredow, Laura; Zinke, Silke; Froschauer, Sonja",2022,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR RHEUMATOLOGIE,10.1007/s00393-022-01197-2,WOS:000781194700001,Germany,"Background In 2012 the outpatient specialist medical care (ASV) was introduced as an intersectoral, interdisciplinary, outpatient care concept. As from 19 April 2018 there is the possibility to form teams for the ASV for rheumatic diseases in adults as well as in children and adolescents.. Material and methods Analysis of previously unpublished data of the National Confederation of Statutory Health Insurance (GKV-SV) and of data of the ASV service department and a comparison with data of standard healthcare services and with the previous care concept of outpatient care in hospitals (ABK). Results After its introduction for 3.5 years, the ASV in rheumatology for adult care has developed into a significant healthcare model for rheumatologists in private practices and hospitals. There were 57 teams consisting of 458 rheumatologists in ASV rheumatism for adults, which represent 44% of all rheumatologists involved in adult care. For children and adolescents, there were 7 teams with 19 pediatric rheumatologists, i.e. 8% of pediatric rheumatologists in health care. The number of patients treated was still significantly lower than the potential, but showed a strong increase. Almost 64,000 adults and 811 children and adolescents were treated in the ASV in the second quarter of 2021. Outlook Whether the facilitation of outpatient care and the introduction of hybrid diagnosis-related groups planned in the coalition agreement will spur the ASV development remains to be seen.",0,0,Rheumatological diseases; Outpatient treatment; Inpatient treatment; Adults; Children and adolescents,Article
Sub-Ethnic and Geographic Variations in Out-of-Pocket Private Health Insurance Premiums Among Mid-Life Asians,"Choi, Sunha; SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC; Choi, Sunha; Choi, Sunha",2017,JOURNAL OF AGING AND HEALTH,10.1177/0898264316635563,WOS:000394674800003,USA,"Objective: This study examined out-of-pocket premium burden of mid-life Asian Americans by comparing six sub-groups of Asians after controlling for geographic clustering at the county and state levels. Method: The 2007-2011 National Health Interview Survey was linked to community-level data and analyzed for 4,628 Asians (ages 50-64), including 697 Asian Indians, 1,125 Chinese, 1,393 Filipinos, 434 Japanese, 524 Koreans, and 455 Vietnamese. Non-Hispanic Whites were included as a comparison group (n = 48,135). Three-level multilevel modeling (state > county > individual) was conducted. Results: Koreans and Vietnamese were found as vulnerable sub-groups considering their lower private health insurance rates and higher uninsured rates. Among those with private insurance, Asians, specifically Filipinos, paid significantly less than non-Hispanic Whites. Moderate but significant variations in the county- and state-level variance in out-of-pocket premiums were found, especially among mid-life Asians. Discussion: This study demonstrates the importance of examining within-group heterogeneity and geographic variations in understanding premium burden among mid-life Asians.",3,0,health insurance; mid-life adults; Asian Americans; CANCER INCIDENCE; UNITED-STATES; MEDICARE; POPULATIONS; AMERICANS; COVERAGE; ADULTS,Article

What should health insurance cover?

Israel shares with the US reliance on a regulated insurance market and we compare the approaches of the two countries regarding determining health benefits. Based on review and analysis of literature, laws and policy in the United States and Israel. The Israeli experience consists of selection of a starting point for defining coverage; calculating the expected cost of covered benefits; and creating a mechanism for updating covered benefits within a defined budget. In implementing the Affordable Care Act, the US rejected a comprehensive and detailed approach to essential health benefits. Instead, federal regulators established broadly worded minimum standards that can be supplemented through more stringent state laws and insurer discretion. Notwithstanding differences between the two systems, the elements of the Israeli approach to coverage, which has stood the test of time, may provide a basis for the United States as it renews its health reform debate and considers delegating decisions about coverage to the states. Israel can learn to emulate the more forceful regulation of supplemental and private insurance that characterizes health policy in the United States.",0,0,CARE,Article

Considering these three time intervals, this article analyzes the susceptibility of health plan and insurance companies to economic cycles of recession in Brazil and the United States. There is evidence of a relationship between periods of economic crisis and retraction of actions and services in national health systems. However, both the United States and Brazil showed a growth in the number of health and insurance plans. The vectors driving the expansion of the private market in both countries have similarities and singularities. The ""Obamacare"" marks the beginning of the inclusion of population segments in the coverage of programs that use private care schemes, funded with government resources. In Brazil, despite negative general economic indices and reduction in the public health budget, health plan companies increased revenues and profits, even in the context of the pandemic and the growing economic crisis in the country. Business strategies to attract foreign investors were combined with actions to obtain credits from public institutions and increase tax deductions and exemptions, preserving financial gains. A comparison between the impacts of the financial crisis on the Brazilian and American private health markets allowed us to identify the weaknesses of our universal public system absorbed by market rationality.",0,0,Health Systems; Supplemental Health; Prepaid Health Plans; Health Insurance; Economic Recession,Article

CAR-T cell therapies were first subject to economic evaluation from 2019 in France. We aim to describe the process and results of the economic evaluation of tisagenlecleucel and axicabtagene ciloleucel as well as the challenges these evaluations raised. Evaluations submitted by the firms were reviewed by HAS and submitted to the Committee of Economic Evaluation and Public Health (CEESP). The CEESP issued opinions related to: (1) the methodological quality of economic evidence and, (2) the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the drugs. The CEESP invalidated the estimated incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) of tisagenlecleucel due to the insufficient clinical evidence and methodological quality to extrapolate the long-term progression of the disease after treatment and compare tisagenlecleucel with alternatives. The CEESP concluded that tisagenlecleucel was not proven cost-effective. The estimated ICUR of axicabtagene ciloleucel at rectangle 114,509/QALY vs. chemotherapies was associated with an acceptable level of methodological quality despite being based on a weak indirect comparison and limited data on quality of life. The CEESP considered axicabtagene ciloleucel ICUR to be ""very high"" and questioned the societal/community willingness-to-pay of the claimed price. The primary source of uncertainty surrounding the ICUR estimates of both drugs was the lack of hindsight on effectiveness. The economic evaluation of CAR-T cell therapies highlights the risk of inefficient resource allocation driven by limited clinical data. It calls for payment schemes accounting for this risk and effective collection of post-marketing data.",0,0,Cost-effectiveness; Budget impact; CAR-T; Health technology; assessment,Article

The healthcare system and the provision of oral healthcare in European Union member states. Part 8: Italy,"Bindi, M.; Paganelli, C.; Eaton, K.

Italy's public healthcare system - the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN) - is organised by the Ministry of Health and administered on a devolved regional basis. It is financed by general taxation that provides universal coverage, largely free of charge at the point of service. The central government establishes the basic national health benefits package, which must be uniformly provided throughout the country, through services guaranteed under the NHS provision called LEA - (Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza [Essential Level of Assistance]) and allocates national funds to the regions. The regions, through their regional health departments, are responsible for organising, administering and delivering primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare services as well as preventive and health promotion services. Regions are allowed a large degree of autonomy in how they perform this role and regarding decisions about the local structure of the system. Complementary and supplementary private health insurance is also available. However, as in most other Mediterranean European countries, in Italy oral healthcare is mainly provided under private arrangements. The public healthcare system provides only 5-8% of oral healthcare services and this percentage varies from region to region. Oral healthcare is included in the Legislation on Essential levels of care (LEAs) for specific populations such as children, vulnerable people (medically compromised and those on low income) and individuals who need oral healthcare in some urgent/emergency cases. For other people, oral healthcare is generally not covered. Apart from the national benefits package, regions may also carry out their own initiatives autonomously, but must finance these themselves. The number of dentists working in Italy has grown rapidly in the last few years. In December 2014, there were 59,324 practicing dentists with a ratio of one dentist every 1025 inhabitants, about 90,000 dental chair-side assistants, about 26,000 dental technicians and about 4000 dental hygienists. To enrol in an Italian dental school a student must pass a competitive national entrance examination after obtaining a high school leaving certificate. For entry in the 2015-2016 cycle, there were 792 places for dentistry. In comparison with dental schools in other EU member states, the number of dental students per school is low with an average of 20 students per year, per school and a range of 10 to 60. The aims of this paper are to give a brief description of the organisation of healthcare in Italy, to outline the system for the provision of oral healthcare in Italy and to explain and discuss the latest changes",17,0,,Article

Methods The study used 2005/2006 and 2009/2010 waves of the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. Children with a current diagnosis of autism were included in the sample. Children residing in 14 states and the District of Columbia that were not covered by the mandate in the 2005/2006 survey, but were covered in the 2009/2010 survey, served as the mandate group. Children residing in 32 states that were not covered by a mandate in either wave served as the comparison group. Outcome measures assessed included care quality, family economics, and child health. A difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) approach was used to assess the impact of the mandates on racial disparities in outcomes. Results Non-white children had less access to family-centered care compared to white children in both waves of data, but this difference was not apparent across mandate and comparison states as only the comparison states had significant differences. Parents of non-white children reported paying less in annual out-of-pocket expenses compared to parents of white children across waves and groups. DDD estimates did not provide evidence that the mandates had statistically significant effects on improving or worsening racial disparities for any outcome measure.
