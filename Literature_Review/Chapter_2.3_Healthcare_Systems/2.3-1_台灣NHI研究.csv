The effectiveness of case management and nursing counselling among caregivers of patients with dementia: A pilot study,"Yu, Mei-Ling; Chen, Hung Ju; Chen, Kee-Hsin; Sung, Jia-Ying; WILEY; Yu, Mei-Ling; Chen, Hung Ju; Sung, Jia-Ying; Yu, Mei-Ling; Chen, Kee-Hsin; Chen, Hung Ju; Sung, Jia-Ying; Chen, Kee-Hsin; Sung, Jia-Ying; Sung, Jia-Ying; yu, meiling; Chen, Kee-Hsin; Chen, Kee-Hsin",2024,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,10.1002/hpm.3838,WOS:001295552700001,Taiwan,"According to the data released by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2021, in 2019, 235,000 patients sought medical treatment for dementia-related diseases at the National-Health-Insurance-participating hospitals and clinics for more than three outpatient visits or had been hospitalised, and the number had increased by 15,000 from the previous year (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2021). This implies that families are affected, causing tremendous physical, psychological, and economic pressures and burdens on the caregivers and families of the patient. The estimated social cost of caring for dementia families increased from $1.3 trillion in 2019 to $2.8 trillion in 2030 (World Health Organisation, 2021). Thus, long-term care for the dementia population has become a critical issue in medical care and social services in Taiwan and worldwide. In 2017, Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare has been starting Dementia care policy with 10 years long-term care plan through set up dementia care centre. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of dementia care centre for reducing the burden and improving the quality of life for caregivers of dementia patients. This pilot study adopts a quasi-experimental research design and uses purposive sampling to select in house informal caregivers of dementia patients who are part of a dementia collaborative care programme at a medical centre in the northern region and were willing to participate in this study. Upon enrolment in the study, subjects were given a pre-test, followed by a one-hour face-to-face nursing consultation and assessment after 2 weeks. Subsequently, a telephone nursing consultation was conducted once a month for 3 months. Two weeks after completing all counselling sessions, a post-test was administered to measure the caregiver burden with The Chinese version of the Caregiver Burden Inventory and the quality of life for caregivers with The 'Chinese Health Questionnaire CHQ-12'. After providing case management and nursing counselling, the total caregiver burden score significantly decreased from an average of 40.1 (SD = 21.6) at the pre-test to an average of 38.6 (SD = 21.4) at the post-test, reaching statistical significance (p < 0.01). The results of this study showed that providing dementia caregivers with case management and nursing consultation services helps improve the overall caregiver burden (particularly emotional burden and physical burden) as well as the health questionnaire scores. However, the social burden and time burden did not improve after receiving case management and counselling among caregivers; instead, post-test scores of these aspects were significantly higher.",0,0,caregiver burden; case management; dementia; nursing counselling; BURDEN,Article
Advanced Medication Alert System Decreased Hospital-Based Outpatient Duplicated Medications: A Longitudinal Hospital Cohort Study,"Kuo, Yu-Chun; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Chiu, Herng-Chia; LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS; Kuo, Yu-Chun; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Chiu, Herng-Chia; Chiu, Herng-Chia; Chiu, Herng-Chia; Chiu, Herng-Chia; Chiu, Herng-Chia",2022,JOURNAL OF PATIENT SAFETY,10.1097/PTS.0000000000000824,WOS:000758370800008,Peoples R China; Taiwan; USA,"Objectives This study aimed to examine the associations between adoption of an advanced medication alert system and decreases in hospital-based outpatient duplicated medication rates in Taiwan. Methods The unit of analysis was the hospital. We merged the hospital medication alert system adoption survey data and Taiwan National Health Insurance outpatient claims data. The observation time was 1998 to 2011, divided into 5 periods (T1-T5). The analysis included 216 hospitals, and outcome variable was hospital-based outpatient duplicated medication rates. The system adoption time frame, hospital accreditation level, and number of drugs per prescription were defined as predicted variables. A generalized estimating equation regression model was used. Results Adoption of the advanced medication alert system gradually increased, such that 100% of medical centers and 84% of regional hospitals, but less than 50% of district hospitals, had systems by T5. The hospital-based outpatient duplicated medication rate continually decreased, from 29.8% to 11.2%. The generalized estimating equation model showed rates of duplicated medications of b = -8.44 at T2 and b = -17.88 at T5 (P < 0.001) compared with T1. Medical centers and regional hospitals demonstrated much lower duplication rates (b = -13.71, b = -6.82; P < 0.001) compared with district hospitals. Hospitals with more medications per prescription had higher duplication rates than did hospitals with fewer items. Conclusions Hospitals accredited at higher levels tended to have advanced medication alert systems. Hospitals that implemented advanced systems decreased hospital-based outpatient duplicated medications, avoiding a potential risk due to inappropriate medication use.",0,0,medication alert system; duplicated medication; overlapping prescription; PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY; POTENTIALLY INAPPROPRIATE MEDICATION; ADVERSE DRUG-REACTIONS; DECISION-SUPPORT; ERROR; CARE; PREVALENCE; CONTINUITY; INCREASE; QUALITY,Article

We used nationwide population-based data from Taiwan to explore the effects of care continuity and coordination on mortality and costs for heart failure. Methods: We analyzed all 18,991 heart failure patients 18 years of age or older and discharged from hospitals in 2016 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance claims data. Cox proportional hazard and multiple linear regression models were used, after adjustment for patient characteristics, to explore the relative impacts of the continuity of care (COC) index and care density on 1-year mortality and costs. Results: Higher COC index was associated with lower mortality (low vs. medium: hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-1.71; high vs. medium: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61-0.72) and costs (low vs. medium: cost ratio [CR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16; high vs. medium: CR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.88). Low care density was associated with higher mortality (low vs. medium: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.20). Higher care density was associated with lower costs (low vs. medium: CR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.18; high vs. medium: CR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.73-0.79). Conclusions: Low care continuity and coordination are associated with higher 1-year post-discharge mortality and costs.

"Impact of Care Coordination on 30-Day Readmission, Mortality, and Costs for Heart Failure","Chang, Guann-Ming; Tung, Yu-Chi; MANAGED CARE & HEALTHCARE COMMUNICATIONS LLC; Tung, Yu-Chi; Tung, Yu-Chi; Tung, Yu-Chi",2024,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE,10.37765/ajmc.2024.89533,WOS:001416139700002,Taiwan,"OBJECTIVES: Although coordination of care has become the main focus of health care reform efforts to improve outcomes and decrease costs, limited information is available concerning the impact of care coordination on 30-day outcomes and costs. We used nationwide, population-based data to examine the influence of care coordination on 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs for heart failure (HF).STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 20,713 patients with HF 18 years or older discharged from hospitals in 2016 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The coordination of care among a patient's outpatient physicians was measured with care density.METHODS: Multilevel regression models were used after adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics to explore the impact of care density on 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs.RESULTS: Patients with high care coordination had lower odds of 30-day readmission (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98) and mortality (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.99) and lower costs (cost ratio [CR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.90) compared with those with low care coordination. Patients with medium care coordination had lower costs (CR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.98) than those with low care coordination. CONCLUSIONS: High care coordination is associated with decreased 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs for HF. Enhancing coordination of care has the potential to increase the value of care. It is important to monitor coordination of care and develop strategies to maintain high levels of care coordination for HF.",1,0,PROFILING HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE; QUALITY-OF-CARE; AFTER-DISCHARGE; OUTCOMES; CONTINUITY; RATES; ASSOCIATION; DEATH,Article

Methods and Study Design: Participants from the Elderly Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (1999-2000) formed this cohort. Dietary information was collected by 24-hr recall and simplified food frequency questionnaire. Dietary quality was assessed by dietary diversity score (DDS, 0-6). Annual medical service utilization and expenditure were derived from National Health Insurance claims until 2006. Survivorship was ascertained from the National Death Registry until 2008. Cox proportional- hazards models were used to determine the association between aboriginality and mortality in conjunction with dietary diversity. Results: Indigenes (n=156) compared with nonindigenes (n=1182) significantly differed in socio-demography, behaviors and chronic disease prevalences. For up to 8 years, indigenes had a higher mortality rate (46.2% vs 33.6%, p=0.003). Indigenes' nutrient intakes were less for polyunsaturated fat, dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals (but more sodium); food intakes more for meat, with less cooking oil, dairy products and fruits; and a lower DDS, (3.61 vs 4.54). They had a 41% higher mortality risk (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.09-1.81, p=0.008). Control for demographic variables did not change the findings. However, the increase in HR was substantially attenuated by the inclusion of DDS (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88-1.49, p=0.316). There was no significant interaction between aboriginality and DDS on mortality (p=0.673). Conclusions: Older indigenous Taiwanese have a higher mortality risk than their majority counterparts. Irrespective of aboriginality, the more diverse diet is associated with a lower risk of mortality.",0,0,Indigenous; mortality; dietary diversity; Taiwan; NAHSIT; HEART-FAILURE HOSPITALIZATION; HEALTH; DISEASE; DETERMINANTS; EXPENDITURE; AUSTRALIA; SURVIVAL; QUALITY; PEOPLES,Article
Assessing quality of primary diabetes care in South Korea and Taiwan using avoidable hospitalizations,"Kim, Hongsoo; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD; Kim, Hongsoo; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Cheng, Shou-Hsia; Kim, Hongsoo",2018,HEALTH POLICY,10.1016/j.healthpol.2018.09.009,WOS:000450380800011,South Korea; Taiwan,"Quality of primary diabetes care is a key health policy concern in many OECD countries with an aging population. This cross-national, population-based study examined the extent and attributes of diabetes related avoidable hospitalizations (DRAHs) in South Korea and Taiwan, both of which have social health insurance-based health systems with limited gate-keeping for hospitalizations. We analyzed comparable, nationally representative health insurance beneficiary datasets for the two countries (2002-2013), linked with community health resource data. The age- and sex-standardized DRAH rates were calculated, and multivariate, multi-level longitudinal modeling approaches were adopted. The DRAH rate decreased in Taiwan consistently during 2002-2013 and in Korea after 2011 only. Under the universal health coverage, people enjoyed high accessibility to care. A higher number of physician visits reduced DRAHs in Korea but not in Taiwan. Socio-economic disparities in DRAHs still existed in both countries, especially in Taiwan. We found a different trajectory in two similar health systems for the selected health system performance indicator for primary diabetes care. This can be partly explained by different policy approaches to diabetes management in the two countries over the years. Necessary are policy efforts to improve the quality and equality of primary diabetes care and better control of hospital admissions in these two health systems that provide generous access to care at a low cost in East Asia.

Assessing Taiwan's pay-for-performance program for diabetes care: a cost-benefit net value approach,"Lu, Jui-fen Rachel; Chen, Ying Isabel; Eggleston, Karen; Chen, Chih-Hung; Chen, Brian; SPRINGER; Lu, Jui-fen Rachel; Lu, Jui-fen Rachel; Lu, Jui-fen Rachel; Chen, Ying Isabel; Eggleston, Karen; Eggleston, Karen; Chen, Chih-Hung; Chen, Brian; Chen, Brian; Eggleston, Karen; Chen, Brian",2023,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,10.1007/s10198-022-01504-3,WOS:000842886400001,Taiwan; USA,"Pay-for-Performance (P4P) to better manage chronic conditions has yielded mixed results. A better understanding of the cost and benefit of P4P is needed to improve program assessment. To this end, we assessed the effect of a P4P program using a quasi-experimental intervention and control design. Two different intervention groups were used, one consisting of newly enrolled P4P patients, and another using P4P patients who have been enrolled since the beginning of the study. Patient-level data on clinical indicators, utilization and expenditures, linked with national death registry, were collected for diabetic patients at a large regional hospital in Taiwan between 2007 and 2013. Net value, defined as the value of life years gained minus the cost of care, is calculated and compared for the intervention group of P4P patients with propensity score-matched non-P4P samples. We found that Taiwan's implementation of the P4P program for diabetic care yielded positive net values, ranging from $40,084 USD to $348,717 USD, with higher net values in the continuous enrollment model. Our results suggest that the health benefits from P4P enrollment may require a sufficient time frame to manifest, so a net value approach incorporating future predicted mortality risks may be especially important for studying chronic disease management. Future research on the mechanisms by which the Taiwan P4P program helped improve outcomes could help translate our findings to other clinical contexts.",0,0,Pay-for-performance; National Health Insurance; Diabetes; Net value; Taiwan; HEALTH-CARE; QUALITY,Article

This prospective cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of mCRC between March 2015 and May 2020. QoL was evaluated before treatment and at 6 months and 1 year posttreatment. All related variables were controlled using the inverse probability of treatment weighting method. Generalized estimating equations with the differencein-difference method was used to explore changes in QoL. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of the two groups was simulated using the annual-cycle Markov decision tree model. Finally, 39 and 76 patients were included in the targeted and nontargeted agent groups, respectively. At 6 months after treatment, QoL of the two groups improved significantly, but the targeted agent group had significantly better QoL than did the nontargeted agent group at 1 year posttreatment (P < 0.05).
