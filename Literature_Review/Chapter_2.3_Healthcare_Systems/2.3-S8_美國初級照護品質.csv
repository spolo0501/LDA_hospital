Patients frequently visit the emergency department (ED) for low back pain, but many experience persistent symptoms at 3 months despite frequent receipt of opioids. Although physical therapy interventions have been demonstrated to improve patient functioning in the outpatient setting, no randomised trial has yet to evaluate physical therapy in the ED setting.",0,0,Emergency department; physical therapy; low back pain; disability; functioning; opioid; cluster-randomized trial; physician-randomized trial; covariate-constrained randomization; MINIMALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES; CONSTRAINED RANDOMIZATION; CATASTROPHIZING SCALE; INTERFERENCE; OUTCOMES; DESIGN,Article
Barriers and facilitators to use of a digital clinical decision support tool: a cohort study combining clickstream and survey data,"Rosenberg, Julie; Miller, Kate; Pickard, Olivia; Henrich, Natalie; Karlage, Ami; Weintraub, Rebecca; BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP; Rosenberg, Julie; Miller, Kate; Pickard, Olivia; Henrich, Natalie; Karlage, Ami; Weintraub, Rebecca; Rosenberg, Julie; Miller, Kate; Pickard, Olivia; Henrich, Natalie; Karlage, Ami; Weintraub, Rebecca; Rosenberg, Julie; Weintraub, Rebecca; Weintraub, Rebecca; Rosenberg, Julie; Rosenberg, Julie; Rosenberg, Julie; Rosenberg, Julie",2022,BMJ OPEN,10.1136/bmjopen-2022-064952,WOS:000889308400024,USA,"ObjectivesThis research aimed to understand the barriers and facilitators clinicians face in using a digital clinical decision support tool-UpToDate-around the globe.DesignWe used a mixed-methods cohort study design that enrolled 1681 clinicians (physicians, surgeons or physician assistants) who applied for free access to UpToDate through our established donation programme during a 9-week study enrolment period. Eligibility included working outside of the USA for a limited-resource public or non-profit health facility, serving vulnerable populations, having at least intermittent internet access, completing the application in English; and not being otherwise able to afford the subscription.InterventionAfter consenting to study participation, clinicians received a 1-year subscription to UpToDate. They completed a series of surveys over the year, and we collected clickstream data tracking their use of the tool.Primary and secondary outcome measures(1) The variation in use by demographic; (2) the prevalence of barriers and facilitators of use; and (3) the relationship between barriers, facilitators and use.ResultsOf 1681 study enrollees, 69% were men and 71% were between 25 and 35 years old, with the plurality practicing general medicine and the majority in sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia. Of the 11 barriers we assessed, fitting the tool into the workflow was a statistically significant barrier, making clinicians 50% less likely to use it. Of the 10 facilitators we assessed, a supportive professional context and utility were significant drivers of use.ConclusionsThere are several clear barriers and facilitators to promoting the use of digital clinical decision support tools in practice. We recommend tools like UpToDate be implemented with complementary services. These include generating a supportive professional context, helping clinicians realise the tools' use and working with health systems to better integrate digital, clinical decision support tools into workflows.",1,0,information technology; health & safety; change management; international health services; quality in health care; medical education & training,Article

Pre-post, difference-in-difference analysis of non-randomised intervention using four quarters of preintervention and six quarters of postintervention National Healthcare Safety Network data for SPARC hospitals (April 2017 to March 2020) and 10 quarters for control hospitals (October 2017 to March 2020). Mixed-effects negative binomial models were used to assess changes over time. Process evaluation using hospital intervention implementation plans, assessments and interviews with staff at eight SPARC hospitals. Maryland, USA. All Maryland acute care hospitals; 12 intervention and 36 control hospitals. Participation in SPARC, a public health-academic collaborative made available to Maryland hospitals, with staggered enrolment between June 2018 and August 2019. Hospitals with higher C. difficile rates were recruited via email and phone. SPARC included assessments, feedback reports and ongoing technical assistance. Primary outcomes were C. difficile incidence rate measured as the quarterly number of C. difficile infections per 10 000 patient-days (outcome measure) and SPARC intervention hospitals' experiences participating in the collaborative (process measures). SPARC invited 13 hospitals to participate in the intervention, with 92% (n=12) participating. The 36 hospitals that did not participate served as control hospitals. SPARC hospitals were associated with 45% greater C. difficile reduction as compared with control hospitals (incidence rate ratio=0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.88, p=0.012). Key SPARC activities, including access to trusted external experts, technical assistance, multidisciplinary collaboration, an accountability structure, peer-to-peer learning opportunities and educational resources, were associated with hospitals reporting positive experiences with SPARC. SPARC intervention hospitals experienced 45% greater reduction in C. difficile rates than control hospitals. A public health-academic collaborative might help reduce C. difficile and other hospital-acquired infections in individual hospitals and at state or regional levels.",0,0,clinical practice guidelines; healthcare quality improvement; patient safety; quality improvement,Article
Cost-Effectiveness of Combination of Baricitinib and Remdesivir in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in the United States: A Modelling Study,"Kelton, Kari; Klein, Tim; Murphy, Dan; Belger, Mark; Hille, Erik; McCollam, Patrick L.; Spiro, Theodore; Burge, Russel; SPRINGER; Kelton, Kari; Klein, Tim; Murphy, Dan; Hille, Erik; Belger, Mark; McCollam, Patrick L.; Spiro, Theodore; Burge, Russel; Burge, Russel; Burge, Russel; Burge, Russel; Hille, Erik Darwin; Burge, Russel",2022,ADVANCES IN THERAPY,10.1007/s12325-021-01982-6,WOS:000721404200001,USA,"Introduction Baricitinib-remdesivir (BARI-REM) combination is superior to remdesivir (REM) in reducing recovery time and accelerating clinical improvement among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), specifically those receiving high-flow oxygen/noninvasive ventilation. Here we assessed the cost-effectiveness of BARI-REM versus REM in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the USA. Methods A three-state model was developed addressing costs and patient utility associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, immediate post hospital care, and subsequent lifetime medical care. Analysis was performed from the perspective of a payer and a hospital. Both perspectives evaluated two subgroups: all patients and patients who required oxygen. The primary measures of benefit in the model were patient quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued during and after hospitalization, cost per life years gained, cost per death avoided, and cost per use of mechanical ventilation avoided. Results In the base-case payer perspective with a lifetime horizon, treatment with BARI-REM versus REM resulted in an incremental total cost of $7962, a gain of 0.446 life years and gain of 0.3565 QALYs over REM. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of using BARI-REM were estimated as $22,334 per QALY and $17,858 per life year. The base-case and sensitivity analyses showed that the total incremental cost per QALY falls within the reduced willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY applied under health emergencies. In all hospitalized patients, treatment with BARI-REM versus REM reduced total hospital expenditures per patient by $1778 and total reimbursement payments by $1526, resulting in a $252 reduction in net costs per patient; it also resulted in a net gain of 0.0018 QALYs and increased survival of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 2.7%. Conclusion Our study showed that BARI-REM is cost-effective compared to using REM for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The base-case results of this cost-effectiveness model were most sensitive to average annual medical costs for recovered patients.",0,0,Baricitinib; Remdesivir; COVID-19; Cost-effectiveness; Hospital; Mechanical ventilation; METABOLIC SYNDROME; HEALTH,Article
