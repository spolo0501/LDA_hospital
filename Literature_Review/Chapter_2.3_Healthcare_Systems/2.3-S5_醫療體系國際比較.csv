DESIGN Retrospective cross sectional cohort study. SETTING Patient level administrative data from the United States, Canada (Ontario and Manitoba), England, the Netherlands, Israel, and Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS Adults aged 66 years and older admitted to hospital with STEMI or NSTEMI between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2017. OUTCOMES MEASURES The three categories of outcomes were coronary revascularisation (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), mortality, and efficiency (hospital length of stay and 30 day readmission). Rates were standardised to the age and sex distribution of the US acute myocardial infarction population in 2017. Outcomes were assessed separately for STEMI and NSTEMI. Performance was evaluated longitudinally (over time) and cross sectionally (between countries). RESULTS The total number of hospital admissions ranged from 19 043 in Israel to 1 064 099 in the US. Large differences were found between countries for all outcomes. For example, the proportion of patients admitted to hospital with STEMI who received percutaneous coronary intervention in hospital during 2017 ranged from 36.9% (England) to 78.6% (Canada; 71.8% in the US); use of percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI increased in all countries between 2011 and 2017, with particularly large rises in Israel (48.4-65.9%) and Taiwan (49.4-70.2%). The proportion of patients with NSTEMI who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 90 days of admission during 2017 was lowest in the Netherlands (3.5%) and highest in the US (11.7%). Death within one year of admission for STEMI in 2017 ranged from 18.9% (Netherlands) to 27.8% (US) and 32.3% (Taiwan). Mean hospital length of stay in 2017 for STEMI was lowest in the Netherlands and the US (5.0 and 5.1 days) and highest in Taiwan (8.5 days); 30 day readmission for STEMI was lowest in Taiwan (11.7%) and the US (12.2%) and highest in England (23.1%). CONCLUSIONS In an analysis of myocardial infarction in six high income countries, all countries had areas of high performance, but no country excelled in all three domains. Our findings suggest that countries could learn from each other by using international comparisons of patient level nationally representative data.",0,0,Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Academy; Acute; Acute myocardial infarction; Address; Admission activity; Affect; Age; Age Distribution; Algorithms; Aortic Aneurysm; Canada; Cardiac Catheterization Procedures; Carotid Arteries; Clinical; Collaborations; Comparative Study; Congestive Heart Failure; Consult; Country; Data; Development; Disadvantaged; Disease; Economics; Elderly; England; Epidemiology; Future; Health; Health system; Healthcare; Healthcare Systems; Hip Fractures; Hospitals; Imaging Techniques; Income; Inequality; Infant Mortality; Inferior; Injury; International; Investments; Ischemic Stroke; Israel; Knowledge; Lead; Learning; Length of Stay; Life Expectancy; Literature; Measures; Medical; Medicine; Methods; Netherlands; Older Population; Outcome; Outpatients; Patient-Focused Outcomes; Patients; Pattern; Performance; Policies; Population; Population Study; Province; Replacement Arthroplasty; Research; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Research Support; Resource Allocation; Sex Distribution; Site; Social Work; Societal Factors; Socioeconomic Status; Time; Tracer; Treatment Effectiveness; Treatment outcome; Update; Visit; Work; acute care; common treatment; comorbidity; comparative; cost; disadvantaged population; experience; head-to-head comparison; health care service utilization; health difference; hospital readmission; hospitalization rates; improved; insight; low socioeconomic status; mortality; older patient; patient subsets; peer; population health; procedure cost; repaired; safety net; social; social deprivation; treatment comparison; PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION; ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION; UNITED-STATES; ACCF/AHA GUIDELINE; FOCUSED UPDATE; TASK-FORCE; CARE; MANAGEMENT; ASSOCIATION; SOCIETY,Article

A cross-sectional study was performed using the dataset from the third cycle of the PMAQ-AB. Three typologies of coordination of care were created: PMAQ-AB, Atlas, and Observatory. Chi-square test was applied to compare proportions and Kruskal-Wallis and Nemenyi tests to verify and identify potential differences between the typologies. Significance was set at 5%. In all, 35,350 teams were assessed that performed some activity in care coordination. A significant difference was observed (p < 0.001) between levels of coordination, with a higher percentage between the high and medium levels in the three instruments, PMAQ-AB (56.07% and 38.35%), Atlas (52.63% and 40.66%), and Observatory (44.82% and 43.98%). In the comparison of the indicators, there was a significant difference (p < 0.001) between the typologies. For Brazil, in the PMAQ-AB typology, all the strata displayed a higher percentage between the high and medium levels; in the Atlas, stratum 1 stood out in the medium level (43.81%); the high level predominated in the Observatory. In the comparison of the indicators by strata, at least one stratum differed from the others (p < 0.001). Number 6 differed from the others (p < 0.001), and number 1 differed from all of them (p < 0.001) except number 2 (p > 0.05). The levels of coordination of care differed according to the instruments used.

Feasibility Study on Energy Audit and Data Driven Analysis Procedure for Building Energy Efficiency: Bench-Marking in Korean Hospital Buildings,"Hwang, Dong Kon; Cho, Jinkyun; Moon, Junghwan; MDPI; Hwang, Dong Kon; Cho, Jinkyun; Moon, Junghwan; Cho, Jinkyun; Cho, Jinkyun",2019,ENERGIES,10.3390/en12153006,WOS:000482174800165,South Korea,"Growths in population, increasing demand for health care services and comfort levels, together with patients on the rise in time spent inside hospitals, assure the upward trend that energy demand will continue in the future. Since the hospital buildings operate 24 hours, 365 days a year for the treatment and restoration of patients, they are approximately 2-3 times more energy-intensive than normal buildings. For this reason, energy efficiency in hospitals is one of the prime objectives for energy policy at regional, national and international levels. This study aims to find how meaningful energy performance, reflecting good energy management and energy conservation measures (ECMs), can be operated for hospital buildings, a category encompassing complex buildings with different systems and large gaps between them. Energy audit allows us to obtain knowledge from the healthcare facility, in order to define and tune data driven analysis rules. The use of benchmarking in the energy audit of healthcare facilities enables immediate comparison between hospitals. Data driven energy analysis also allows ascertaining their expected energy consumption and estimating the possible savings margin by using the building energy flow chart. In the 2015-2017 periods, bench-marking of four public hospitals in Seoul were audited for the energy consumption related to weather conditions, total area, bed numbers, employee numbers, and analyzed for building energy flow by zones, energy sources, systems and equipment. This is a practice-based learning in a hospital project. The results reveal that the average annual energy consumption of a hospital under normal conditions, and energy efficiency factors are divided into energy baselines, energy consumption goals for energy saving and energy usage trends for setting ECMs, respectively. The indicator dependent on the area of inpatients (number of beds) proved to be the most suitable as a reference to quantify the energy consumption of a hospital.",0,0,hospital facility; ECMs: Energy conservation measures; energy audit; energy analysis; building energy flow chart; CONSUMPTION; SYSTEMS; SAVINGS,Article
New governance of the digital health agency: a way out of the joint decision trap to implement electronic health records in Germany?,"Schmitt, Tugce; CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS; Schmitt, Tugce; Schmitt, Tugce; Schmitt, Tugce; Schmitt, Tugce; Schmitt, Tugce",2024,HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW,10.1017/S1744133123000142,WOS:001268436300005,Germany; Netherlands,"Fragmentation in health systems leads to discontinuities in the provision of health services, reduces the effectiveness of interventions, and increases costs. In international comparisons, Germany is notably lagging in the context of healthcare (data) integration. Despite various political efforts spanning decades, intersectoral care and integrated health data remain controversial and are still in an embryonic phase in the country. Even more than 2 years after its launch, electronic health record (elektronische Patientenakte; ePA) users in Germany constitute only 1 per cent of the statutorily insured population, and ongoing political debates suggest that the path to broader coverage is fraught with complexities. By exploring the main stakeholders in the existing (fragmented) health system governance in Germany and their sectoral interests, this paper examines the implementation of ePA through the lens of corporatism, offering insights based on an institutional decision theory. The central point is that endeavours to better integrate health data for clinical care, scientific research and evidence-informed policymaking in Germany will need to address the roles of corporatism and self-governance.",0,0,health data governance; electronic health records; institutionalism; corporatism; Germany; CARE; INTEGRATION,Article

Understanding clinical practice in different health systems can identify areas for quality improvement initiatives to improve outcomes. In the absence of international comparison studies, we aimed to compare treatments and in-hospital outcomes of patients admitted with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by heart failure status in two healthcare-wide cohorts. Methods and resultsWe used two nationwide databases to capture admissions with STEMI in the United Kingdom (Myocardial ischemia National Audit Project, MINAP) and Japan (Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases-Diagnostic Procedure Combination, JROAD-DPC) between 2012 and 2017. Participants were stratified using the HF Killip classification into three groups; Killip 1: no congestive heart failure, Killip 2-3: congestive heart failure, Killip 4: cardiogenic shock. We calculated crude rate and case mix standardized risk ratios (CSRR) for use of treatments and in-hospital death. Patients were younger in the United Kingdom (65.4 [13.6] vs. 69.1 [13.0] years) and more likely to have co-morbidities in the United Kingdom except for diabetes and hypertension. Japan had a higher percentage of heart failure and cardiogenic shock patients among STEMI during admission than that in the United Kingdom. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) rates were lower in the United Kingdom compared with Japan, especially for patients presenting with Killip 2-3 class heart failure (pPCI use in patients with Killip 1, 2-3, 4: Japan, 86.2%, 81.7%, 78.7%; United Kingdom, 79.6%, 58.2% and 79.9%). In contrast, beta-blocker use was consistently lower in Japan than in the United Kingdom (61.4% vs. 90.2%) across Killip classifications and length of hospital stay longer (17.0 [9.7] vs. 5.0 [7.4] days). The crude rate of in-hospital mortality increased with increasing Killip class group. Both the crude rate and CSRR was higher in the United Kingdom compared with Japan for Killip 2-3 (15.8% vs. 6.4%, CSRR 1.80 95% CI 1.73-1.87, P < 0.001), and similar for Killip 4 (36.9% vs. 36.3%, CSRR 1.11 95% CI 1.08-1.13, P < 0.001). ConclusionsImportant differences in the care and outcomes for STEMI with heart failure exist between the United Kingdom and Japan. Specifically, in the United Kingdom, there was a lower rate of pPCI, and in Japan, fewer patients were prescribed beta blockers and hospital length of stay was longer. This international comparison can inform targeted quality improvement programmes to narrow the outcome gap between health systems.",0,0,ST elevation myocardial infarction; Heart failure; Medications; Mortality; ST-SEGMENT-ELEVATION; PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION; EUROPEAN-SOCIETY; HOSPITAL OUTCOMES; NATIONAL-REGISTRY; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; HETEROGENEITY; REPERFUSION; PREDICTORS,Article
Universal health coverage and equal access in Sweden: a century-long perspective on macro-level policy,"Fredriksson, Mio; BMC; Fredriksson, Mio; Fredriksson, Mio",2024,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH,10.1186/s12939-024-02193-5,WOS:001233940300001,Sweden,"Background When today's efforts to achieve universal health coverage are mainly directed towards low-income settings, it is perhaps easy to forget that countries considered to have universal, comprehensive and high-performing health systems have also undergone this journey. In this article, the aim is to provide a century-long perspective to illustrate Sweden's long and ongoing journey towards universal health coverage and equal access to healthcare.Methods The focus is on macro-level policy. A document analysis is divided into three broad eras (1919-1955; 1955-1989; 1989-) and synthesises seven points in time when policies relevant to overarching goals and regulation of universal health coverage and equal access were proposed and/or implemented. The development is analysed and concluded in relation to two egalitarian goals in the context of health: equality of access and equal treatment for equal need.Results Over the past century, macro-level policy evolved from the concept of creating access for the neediest and those reliant on wages for their survival to a mandatory insurance with equal right to healthcare for all. However, universal health coverage was not achieved until 1955, and individuals had to rely on their personal financial resources to cover the cost at the time of care utilization until the 1970s. It was not until 1983 that legislation explicitly stated that access to healthcare should be equal for the entire population (horizontal equity), while a vertical equity-principle was not added until 1997. Subsequently, ideas of free choice and privatization have gained significance. For instance, they aim to increase service access, addressing the Swedish health system's Achilles' heel in this regard. However, the principle of equal access for all is now being challenged by the emergence of private health insurance, which offers quicker access to services.Conclusions: brief summary and potential implications It can be concluded that there is no perpetual Swedish healthcare model and various dimensions of access have been the focus of policy discussion. The discussion on access barriers has shifted from financial to personal and organizational ones. Today, Sweden still ranks high in terms of affordability and equity in international comparisons: although not as well as a decade ago. Whether this marks the beginning of a new trend intertwined with a decline in Sweden's welfare 'exceptionalism', or is a temporary decline remains to be assessed in the future.",0,0,Universal health coverage; Equal access; Sweden; Swedish model; Horizontal equity; Vertical equity; WELFARE-STATE; CHOICE; CARE; EUROPE; EQUITY; WILL,Article
Establishing and using reference intervals,"Ozarda, Yesim; WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH; Ozarda, Yesim; Ozarda, Yesim; Ozarda, Yesim; Ozarda, Yesim; Özarda, Yeşim",2020,TURKISH JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY-TURK BIYOKIMYA DERGISI,10.1515/tjb-2017-0299,WOS:000525736100001,Turkey,"Reference intervals (RIs) and clinical decision limits (CDLs) are fundamental tools used by healthcare and laboratory professionals to interpret patient laboratory test results. The traditional method for establishing RIs, known as the direct approach, is based on collecting samples from members of a preselected reference population, making the measurements and then determining the intervals. For challenging groups such as pediatric and geriatric age groups, indirect methods are appointed for the derivation of RIs in the EP28-A3c guideline. However, there has been an increasing demand to use the indirect methods of deriving RIs by the use of routine laboratory data stored in the laboratory information system. International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC), Committee on Reference Intervals and Decision Limits (C-RIDL) is currently working on the study for the comparison of the conventional (direct) and alternative (indirect) approaches for the determination of reference intervals. As a matter of fact that, the process of developing RIs is often beyond the capabilities of an individual laboratory due to the complex, expensive and time-consuming process to develop them. Therefore, a laboratory can alternatively transfer and verify RIs established by an external source (i.e. manufacturers' package inserts, publications). IFCC, C-RIDL has focused primarily on RIs and has performed multicenter studies to obtain common RIs in recent years. However, as the broader responsibility of the Committee, from its name, includes ""decision limits"", the C-RIDL also emphasizes the importance of the correct use of both RIs and CDLs and to encourage laboratories to specify the appropriate information to clinicians as needed.",0,0,Reference intervals; EP28-A3c guideline; Direct reference intervals; Multicenter studies; Indirect methods; IFCC; C-RIDL; Clinical decision limits; Verification of reference intervals; INDIVIDUAL BIOLOGICAL VARIATION; APPROVED RECOMMENDATION 1987; COMMON REFERENCE INTERVALS; REFERENCE VALUES; WORLDWIDE MULTICENTER; GLOBAL MULTICENTER; DERIVATION; LIMITS; NEED; TOOL,Review

To conserve the effectiveness of antibiotics for future generations, antibiotic stewardship approaches to using them only where appropriate and necessary are advocated. Dentistry accounts for about 10% of antibiotic prescriptions across global healthcare, with 80% not in accordance with guidance in some countries. Core outcome sets enable the results of studies to be compared in order to maximise the value which can be derived from them. The aim of this study is to develop an international consensus on a core outcome set for dental antibiotic stewardship. Methods Consensus on outcomes which are critical for inclusion in the core outcome set for dental antibiotic stewardship will be sought through two rounds of a Delphi survey (using the DelphiManager online system) followed by a final online consensus meeting. Thirty participants will be recruited to the Delphi Panel from across three stakeholder groups: ten dentists, ten academics and ten adults experienced with dental antibiotics as either a patient or parent/carer of a patient who has been prescribed them. Consensus will be achieved if more than 70% of the panel agree that an outcome is critical, with at least one from each stakeholder group in agreement. A long-list of candidate core outcomes has been developed from previously published studies with additions recommended by the steering group. The steering group will oversee development of the core outcome set and includes people from around the world with experience of dental antibiotics: clinicians, researchers and people with experience of being prescribed dental antibiotics and/or surviving an antibiotic resistant infection. Discussion To date, few studies of dental antibiotic stewardship have been published. Internationally, dental antibiotic guidelines and patterns of use vary widely, so a core outcome set is particularly important to facilitate meaningful comparisons between studies. This core outcome set will encompass antibiotic prescribing for both therapeutic indications, such as for people with acute infections, and for prophylactic indications, such as the prevention of distant site infections (like infective endocarditis) following dental procedures.",1,0,Antibiotic; Dental; Prescribing; Resistance; Stewardship; Core outcome set,Article

Logistic regression was used to examine patient characteristics associated with multimorbidity under all four definitions.Results MM2+ was most common (40.4%) followed by MM3+ (27.5%), MM3+ from 3+ (22.6%), and mental-physical MM (18.9%). MM2+, MM3+, and MM3+ from 3+ were strongly associated with oldest age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 58.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 56.13 to 60.14; aOR 77.69, 95% CI = 75.33 to 80.12; and aOR 102.06, 95% CI = 98.61 to 105.65; respectively), but mental-physical MM was much less strongly associated (aOR 4.32, 95% CI = 4.21 to 4.43).
