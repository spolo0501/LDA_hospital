There is a scarcity of data regarding the proportion, healthcare utilisation and costs of patients with uncontrolled severe asthma in Asia. This study aimed to plug the knowledge gap in this area. Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients with asthma managed in our respiratory specialist clinic were evaluated prospectively. Healthcare utilisation comprising unscheduled asthma-related primary care visits, emergency department (ED) visits and hospital admissions were obtained from the national health records system. We defined uncontrolled severe asthma as poor symptom control (Asthma Control Test score <20); 2 or more asthma exacerbations requiring >= 3 days of systemic corticosteroids in the previous year; 1 or more serious asthma exacerbation requiring hospitalisation in the previous year; or airflow limitation with pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEND <80% predicted despite high dose inhaled corticosteroids and another controller medication. Results: Of the 423 study participants, 49 (11.6%) had uncontrolled severe asthma. Compared to non-severe asthma, patients with uncontrolled severe asthma were older and more likely to be female and obese. They had a median of 2 (interquarfile range: 0 to 3) exacerbations a year, with 51% having >= 2 exacerbations in the past 12 months. They were responsible for 43.9% of the hospital admissions experienced by the whole study cohort. Mean annual direct asthma costs per patient was S$2952 +/- S$4225 in uncontrolled severe asthma vs S$841 +/- S$815 in non severe asthma. Conclusion: Approximately 12% of patients with asthma managed in a hospital-based respiratory specialist clinic in Singapore have uncontrolled severe asthma. They account for a disproportionate amount of healthcare utilisation and costs. Healthcare strategies targeting these patients are urgently needed.",15,0,Cost; Exacerbations; Singapore; DIFFICULT; COSTS; IDENTIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PREVALENCE; BURDEN; TRENDS; COHORT; UK,Article
Trauma-Informed Approaches in Primary Healthcare and Community Mental Healthcare: A Mixed Methods Systematic Review of Organisational Change Interventions,"Lewis, Natalia V.; Bierce, Angel; Feder, Gene S.; Macleod, John; Turner, Katrina M.; Zammit, Stan; Dawson, Shoba; WILEY; Lewis, Natalia V.; Bierce, Angel; Feder, Gene S.; Macleod, John; Turner, Katrina M.; Dawson, Shoba; Lewis, Natalia V.; Feder, Gene S.; Turner, Katrina M.; Zammit, Stan; Lewis, Natalia V.; Feder, Gene S.; Turner, Katrina M.; Zammit, Stan; Macleod, John; Turner, Katrina M.; Zammit, Stan; Lewis, Natalia V.; Lewis, Natalia V.; Lewis, Natalia V.; Macleod, John; Lewis, Natalia V; Feder, Gene; Lewis, Natalia; Turner, Katrina; Dawson, Shoba; Zammit, Stanley",2023,HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY,10.1155/2023/4475114,WOS:000991614100001,England; Wales,"A trauma-informed approach is a framework for organisational (synonym system) change interventions that address the universal prevalence and impact of trauma. This mixed methods systematic review assessed the effects of trauma-informed approaches on psychological, behavioural, and health outcomes in health-care providers and adult patients in primary care and community mental healthcare. We searched five databases and grey literature and consulted experts for reports published in January 1990 to June 2021. The quantitative descriptive and qualitative framework syntheses were integrated through a line of argument and mapped onto a logic model. We included six nonrandomised studies that evaluated eight interventions with varied theoretical developments, components, and outcomes. The most common components were budget allocation, workforce development, identification/response to violence and trauma, and evaluation. Evidence for intervention effects was limited and conflicting. Four studies reported improvement in provider readiness and sense of community, while three reported conflicting effects on provider behaviour regarding delivery of trauma-informed care. Four studies reported some improvement in patient readiness for disease management and access to services; however, the evidence for patient satisfaction was conflicting. Two studies found that patients and providers felt safe. While one study reported improvement in patient quality of life and chronic pain, another found no effect on substance use, and three studies reported conflicting effects on mental health. Intervention mechanisms included a package of varied components, tailoring to the organisational needs, capacities and preferences, staff education and self-care, creating safe environments, and shared decision-making. Intervention effects were moderated by contextual (health system values, policies, governance, business models, trauma-informed movement, organisational culture, and social determinants of health) and intervention factors (buy-in from all staff, collective learning through conversations, equal attention to staff and patient well-being, and sustainable funding). No studies measured adverse events/harm, cost effectiveness, or providers' health. We need more methodologically robust evaluations of trauma-informed organisational change interventions.",12,0,COOCCURRING DISORDERS; WOMEN; FRAMEWORK; OUTCOMES,Article

What were both the constraints on, and the challenges to government policies to establish universal health insurance with commercial elements? Are there differences between the cases of these two countries? If there are, what caused those differences? What role have the state, market and civil society institutions played in shaping the health systems of these countries? To answer these questions, this paper analyzes the roles of historical institutional legacies, competitive election, active civil society, the education of doctors and nurses, the allocation of medical human resources in the labor market, the medical device industry, public and private hospitals and inter-sectoral policy measures, with a focus on the linkages within and between the health system and other sectors. It is fair to argue that the different modes of government interventions in various sectors and their varying degrees, in terms of enforcement, resulted in the universal health systems of the two countries being qualitatively different, and resulted in different consequences as regards health equity.",5,0,Universalization; Health System; National Health Insurance; State Intervention; Transformative Social Policy,Article

Engagement in clinical care, especially community-based primary care, is particularly important in the immediate period following community reentry from incarceration, where opportunities to engage clients in services are essential for improved health and reduced recidivism. Trauma-informed care offers an important and innovative opportunity for healthcare systems and primary care providers to improve quality of care and the patient experience, thereby increasing longitudinal engagement of marginalized and hard-to-reach patient populations like persons with criminal justice system exposure. Trauma-informed care implementation includes educating providers and transforming practices to incorporate safety, trust, peer support, collaboration, empowerment, and cultural perspectives into everyday operations and care delivery. While comprehensive trauma-informed care involves transformation on a system level, trauma-informed approaches can also be adopted by the individual provider to improve the clinical consultation.

However, little is known about the effects of racial and ethnic disparities on outcomes. This study assessed trends in EC-IC bypass outcomes among MMD patients stratified by race and ethnicity. - METHODS: Utilizing the US National Inpatient Sample, we identified MMD patients undergoing EC-IC bypass between 2002 and 2020. Demographic and hospital-level data were collected. Multivariable analysis was conducted to identify independent factors associated with outcomes. Trend analysis was performed using piecewise joinpoint regression. - RESULTS: Out of 14,062 patients with MMD, 1771 underwent EC-IC bypass. Of these, 60.59% were White, 17.56% were Black, 12.36% were Asians, 8.47% were Hispanic, and 1.02% were Native Americans. Nonhome discharge was noted in 21.7% of cases, with a 6.7% death and 3.8% postoperative neurologic complications rates. EC-IC bypass was more commonly performed in Native Americans (23.38%) and Asians (17.76%). Hispanics had the longest mean length of stay (8.4 days) and lower odds of nonhome discharge compared to Whites (odds ratio: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.40-1.03; P [ 0.04). Patients with Medicaid, private insurance, self-payers, and insurance paid by other governments had lower odds of nonhome discharge than those with Medicare. - CONCLUSION: This study highlights racial and socioeconomic disparities in EC-IC bypass for patients with MMD. Despite these disparities, we did not find any significant difference in the quality of care. Addressing these disparities is essential for optimizing MMD outcomes.",2,0,Extracranial-intracranial bypass; Moyamoya; Social disparities; SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT; UNITED-STATES; CRANIOTOMY; DISCHARGE,Article

We used nationwide, population-based data to examine the influence of care coordination on 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs for heart failure (HF).STUDY DESIGN: We analyzed 20,713 patients with HF 18 years or older discharged from hospitals in 2016 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The coordination of care among a patient's outpatient physicians was measured with care density.METHODS: Multilevel regression models were used after adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics to explore the impact of care density on 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs.RESULTS: Patients with high care coordination had lower odds of 30-day readmission (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98) and mortality (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.99) and lower costs (cost ratio [CR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.90) compared with those with low care coordination. Patients with medium care coordination had lower costs (CR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.98) than those with low care coordination. CONCLUSIONS: High care coordination is associated with decreased 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs for HF. Enhancing coordination of care has the potential to increase the value of care.

Eligibility included working outside of the USA for a limited-resource public or non-profit health facility, serving vulnerable populations, having at least intermittent internet access, completing the application in English; and not being otherwise able to afford the subscription.InterventionAfter consenting to study participation, clinicians received a 1-year subscription to UpToDate. They completed a series of surveys over the year, and we collected clickstream data tracking their use of the tool.Primary and secondary outcome measures(1) The variation in use by demographic; (2) the prevalence of barriers and facilitators of use; and (3) the relationship between barriers, facilitators and use.ResultsOf 1681 study enrollees, 69% were men and 71% were between 25 and 35 years old, with the plurality practicing general medicine and the majority in sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia. Of the 11 barriers we assessed, fitting the tool into the workflow was a statistically significant barrier, making clinicians 50% less likely to use it. Of the 10 facilitators we assessed, a supportive professional context and utility were significant drivers of use.ConclusionsThere are several clear barriers and facilitators to promoting the use of digital clinical decision support tools in practice. We recommend tools like UpToDate be implemented with complementary services. These include generating a supportive professional context, helping clinicians realise the tools' use and working with health systems to better integrate digital, clinical decision support tools into workflows.",1,0,information technology; health & safety; change management; international health services; quality in health care; medical education & training,Article

This prospective cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of mCRC between March 2015 and May 2020. QoL was evaluated before treatment and at 6 months and 1 year posttreatment. All related variables were controlled using the inverse probability of treatment weighting method. Generalized estimating equations with the differencein-difference method was used to explore changes in QoL. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of the two groups was simulated using the annual-cycle Markov decision tree model. Finally, 39 and 76 patients were included in the targeted and nontargeted agent groups, respectively. At 6 months after treatment, QoL of the two groups improved significantly, but the targeted agent group had significantly better QoL than did the nontargeted agent group at 1 year posttreatment (P < 0.05).

We searched MEDLINE and Embase from 01/01/1975 to 03/07/2018 for studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of routinely collected healthcare data in identifying epilepsy cases. Any disease coding system in use since the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) was permissible. Two authors independently screened studies, extracted data, and quality-assessed studies. We assessed positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and specificity. The primary analysis was a narrative synthesis of review findings. Thirty studies were included, published between 1989 and 2018. Risks of bias were low, high, and unclear in 4, 14, and 12 studies, respectively. Coding systems included ICD-9, ICD-10, and Read Codes, with or without antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). PPVs included ranges of 5.2%-100% (Canada), 32.7%-96.0% (USA), 47.0%-100% (UK), and 37.0%-88.0% (Norway). Sensitivities included ranges of 22.2%-99.7% (Canada), 12.2%-97.3% (USA), and 79.0%-94.0% (UK). Nineteen studies contained at least one algorithm with a PPV >80%. Sixteen studies contained at least one algorithm with a sensitivity >80%. PPV was highest in algorithms consisting of disease codes (ICD-10 G40-41, ICD-9 345) in combination with one or more AEDs. The addition of symptom codes to this (ICD-10 R56; ICD-9 780.3, 780.39) lowered PPV. Sensitivity was highest in algorithms consisting of symptom codes with one or more AEDs. Although using AEDs alone achieved high sensitivities, the associated PPVs were low. Most NPVs and specificities were >90%. We conclude that it is reasonable to use administrative data to identify people with epilepsy (PWE) in epidemiological research.

To conserve the effectiveness of antibiotics for future generations, antibiotic stewardship approaches to using them only where appropriate and necessary are advocated. Dentistry accounts for about 10% of antibiotic prescriptions across global healthcare, with 80% not in accordance with guidance in some countries. Core outcome sets enable the results of studies to be compared in order to maximise the value which can be derived from them. The aim of this study is to develop an international consensus on a core outcome set for dental antibiotic stewardship. Methods Consensus on outcomes which are critical for inclusion in the core outcome set for dental antibiotic stewardship will be sought through two rounds of a Delphi survey (using the DelphiManager online system) followed by a final online consensus meeting. Thirty participants will be recruited to the Delphi Panel from across three stakeholder groups: ten dentists, ten academics and ten adults experienced with dental antibiotics as either a patient or parent/carer of a patient who has been prescribed them. Consensus will be achieved if more than 70% of the panel agree that an outcome is critical, with at least one from each stakeholder group in agreement. A long-list of candidate core outcomes has been developed from previously published studies with additions recommended by the steering group. The steering group will oversee development of the core outcome set and includes people from around the world with experience of dental antibiotics: clinicians, researchers and people with experience of being prescribed dental antibiotics and/or surviving an antibiotic resistant infection. Discussion To date, few studies of dental antibiotic stewardship have been published. Internationally, dental antibiotic guidelines and patterns of use vary widely, so a core outcome set is particularly important to facilitate meaningful comparisons between studies. This core outcome set will encompass antibiotic prescribing for both therapeutic indications, such as for people with acute infections, and for prophylactic indications, such as the prevention of distant site infections (like infective endocarditis) following dental procedures.",1,0,Antibiotic; Dental; Prescribing; Resistance; Stewardship; Core outcome set,Article

The objective of this study was to determine the impact of expanding publicly subsidised health insurance through the Massachusetts reform on access to primary care, disease management and behavioural risk factors. Using cross-sectional data from the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 2001 to 2010 and exploiting the selective introduction of the healthcare reform, we assessed its impact on primary care access, behavioural risk factors, such as obesity, and receipt of diabetes management tests. We did so using a differences in-differences methodology by comparing Massachusetts with other New England States for 131,002 adults under 300% of the federal poverty level and by race/ethnicity within this group. Triple difference estimates were also conducted to control for potential within state time varying confounding factors. The results suggest that increasing publicly subsidised health insurance had a positive impact on primary care access for lower income adults, particularly those that are white. However, with the exception of improvements in alcohol consumption for one specific group (lower income whites) the reform had no effect on behaviour risk factors or diabetes disease management. The aims of the reform were to improve access to care and through this, behavioural risk factors and diabetes management. This study suggests that while access to care was increased, reducing risk factors attributed to health risky behaviour and diabetes cannot be sufficiently done simply by extending health insurance coverage and the provision of preventive services. This suggests that more targeted interventions are required.",1,0,United States of America; Healthcare reform; Health policy; Health insurance; Behavioural risk factor surveillance system; Health disparities; Primary care access; Disease management; UNITED-STATES; PRIMARY-CARE; MASSACHUSETTS REFORM; NATIONAL-HEALTH; DISPARITIES; INTERVENTION; COVERAGE; SURVEILLANCE; INDIVIDUALS; POPULATION,Article

However, knowledge on the system-wide effectiveness of these reforms is limited. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the reforms' health and health system impacts. In 13 August 2022, international databases and three Chinese databases were searched for randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies and controlled before-after studies. Included studies assessed large-scale PHC policies since 2009; had a temporal comparator and a control group and assessed impacts on expenditures, utilization, care quality and health outcomes. Study quality was assessed using Risk of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions, and results were synthesized narratively. From 49 174 identified records, 42 studies were included-all with quasi-experimental designs, except for one randomized control trial. Nine studies were assessed as at low risk of bias. Only five low- to moderate-quality studies assessed the comprehensive reforms as a whole and found associated increases in health service utilization, whilst the other 37 studies examined single-component policies. The National Essential Medicine Policy (N = 15) and financing reforms (N = 11) were the most studied policies, whilst policies on primary care provision (i.e. family physician policy and the National Essential Public Health Services) were poorly evaluated. The PHC reforms were associated with increased primary care utilization (N = 17) and improved health outcomes in people with non-communicable diseases (N = 8). Evidence on healthcare costs was unclear, and impacts on patients' financial burden and care quality were understudied. Some studies showed disadvantaged regions and groups that accrued greater benefits (N = 8). China's comprehensive PHC reforms have made some progress in achieving their policy objectives including increasing primary care utilization, improving some health outcomes and reducing health inequalities. However, China's health system remains largely hospital-centric and further PHC strengthening is needed to advance universal health coverage.",0,0,Primary health care; China; health reforms; policy evaluations; MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; PERCEIVED QUALITY; RATIONAL USE; MEDICINES; COVERAGE; PROGRESS; POLICY; PRESCRIPTION; COMMISSION; SHENZHEN,Review

In Cameroon, it is very common to find medically discharged patients who have received surgical treatment and are unable to pay the resulting bills. These patients can be held in detention in hospitals until payments are complete. Even the corpses of patients who die with unpaid medical bills can be withheld until their family members pay off the debt. While this practice has been ongoing for many y, there remains very little scholarship on the issue reported in the literature. The main objective of this study was to uncover the lived experiences of discharged patients residing in hospital detention for being unable to pay their medical bills.Methods: In-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and observations were conducted with purposefully selected patients living in detention in 2 rural private hospitals in the Fundong Health District in Cameroon. A thematic framework technique was used to analyze the transcribed data. The study was ethically approved by the Cameroon Bioethics Initiative, and informed consent was obtained from all participants.Results: Living in hospital detention after receiving treatment constitutes an economic, social, and psychological burden for patients. Economically, it exacerbated poverty for the patients unable to purchase food, medications, and clothing due to lack of jobs and financial support. Socially, many of these individuals suffered from isolation, loneliness, shame, stigma, risk of contracting other diseases, and precarious sleeping conditions. The psychological burden was comprised of stress, depression, trauma, nightmares, and suicidal thoughts. Conclusions: The experiences of discharged patients in hospital detention suggest that they live in very deplorable conditions. There is a need for a functional healthcare protection mechanism, such as universal health coverage, to reduce the cost of healthcare services and surgical operations. Alternative payment mechanisms should also be considered. (C) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, this article carries out a systematic review using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta -Analysis) to draw inferences and generate evidences with respect to the influence of cash transfers on two aspects of human capital outcomes of children, viz., child health and nutrition, and educational outcomes in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Forty four studies were selected on the basis of a four-stage procedure that checked for identification, screening, eligi-bility and inclusion. The results indicate that majority of cash transfers based on conditionalities, like mandatory attendance in healthcare organisations and educational institutions, proved to be effective in the selected countries. While 7 studies (16%) showed no changes in the outcomes, 5 (11%) depicted negative impact and the rest (73%) presented a positive result. The selected studies suggest that a strong supply-side mechanism in place in LMICs, ensure functional and quality services at health centres and schools in the respective regions and reflect overwhelming outcomes. Furthermore, incentive design, anticipated termination, and supply-side interventions would be instrumental in avoiding a crisis or shock in the economic sense to recipient households.",0,0,Cash transfers; Education; Child health; Malnutrition; Systematic review; Low; and middle -income countries; TRANSFER PROGRAM; SCHOOL ENROLLMENT; INFANT-MORTALITY; IMPACT; HEALTH; MEXICO; MALNUTRITION; HOUSEHOLD; NUTRITION; COUNTRIES,Review

This study analyzed the relationships between the spatial characteristics of UGSs and morbidity of diseases, which were considered variables of human health in the Taipei Metro. The Longitudinal Health Insurance Database of Taiwan was applied as the source of morbidity of diseases. A canonical correlation analysis was performed by using the six variables of spatial characteristics of UGSs as predictors and three variables of morbidity as criterion variables to evaluate the multivariate shared relationships between the two variable sets. The results found a strong canonical correlation between the spatial characteristics of UGSs and human health.

This challenge of accelerated demographic transition is coupled by the rural-urban disparity in access to healthcare services among the elderly people in India. An important objective of India's National Health Policy (2017) is to ""progressively achieve universal health coverage"" which is posited upon mitigating the sub-national disparity that necessitates identifying the drivers of the disparity for targeted policy intervention. This study, therefore, makes an attempt towards the exploration of the prominent contributory factors behind the rural-urban gap in utilisation of healthcare among the older population in India.MethodsThe analysis has been done by using the unit level data of Social Consumption: Health (Schedule number 25.0) of the 75th round of the National sample Survey conducted during July 2017-June 2018. Two binary logistic models have been proposed to capture the crude and the adjusted association between health seeking behaviour and place of residence (rural/ urban). To compute the group differences (between rural and urban) in the rate of healthcare utilization among the elderly population in India and to decompose these differences into the major contributing factors, Fairlie's decomposition method has been employed.ResultsThe logistic regression models established a strong association between place of residence and likelihood of healthcare utilisation among the Indian elderly people. The results of the Fairlie's decomposition analysis revealed considerable rural-urban inequality disfavouring the rural residents and health care utilisation was found to be 7 percentage points higher among the older population residing in urban India than their rural counterparts. Level of education and economic status, both of which are indicators of a person's Socio-Economic Status, were the two major determinants of the existing rural-urban differential in healthcare utilisation, together explaining 41% of the existing rural-urban differential.ConclusionPublic health care provisions need to be strengthened both in terms of quality and outreach by way of greater public investments in the health sector and by building advanced health infrastructure in the rural areas. Implementation of poverty alleviation programmes and ensuring social-security of the elderly are also indispensable in bringing about equity in healthcare utilisation.",0,0,Rural-urban disparity; Elderly population; Health inequality; Decomposition analysis; Demographic burden; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; MORBIDITY; INEQUALITIES; EXPENDITURE; GENDER; EQUITY; LIFE,Article

Of particular concern are difficulties with the financial costs of covering doctor's appointments, which started to increase dramatically prior to the economic crisis and continued to rise during the crisis, in particular for higher income groups. Difficulties with distance and waiting time declined gradually over time and appear unaffected by the financial crisis, at least until 2011. Subgroups that face significantly more difficulties are women, younger individuals, the full-/part-time employed and individuals with poor health status.

Objective: Using a modified version of the 1978 Tanahashi model as an analytical framework for measuring and assessing health service coverage, this paper aims to examine the system of care at the community level in Ghana's Volta Region to highlight the continued reforms needed to achieve Universal Health Coverage. Methods: The Tanahashi model evaluates health system coverage through five key measures that reflect different stages along the service provision continuum: availability of services; accessibility; initial contact with the health system; continued utilization; and quality coverage. Data from cross-sectional household and health facility surveys were used in this study. Immunization and antenatal care services were selected as tracer interventions to serve as proxies to assess systems bottlenecks. Results: Financial access and quality coverage were identified as the biggest bottlenecks for both tracer indicators. Financial accessibility, measured by enrollment in Ghana's National Health Insurance Scheme was poor with 16.94% presenting valid membership cards. Childhood immunization was high but dropped modestly from 93.8% at initial contact to 76.7% quality coverage. For antenatal care, estimates ranged from 65.9% at initial visit to 25.1% quality coverage. Conclusion: Results highlight the difficulty in achieving high levels of quality service coverage and the large variations that exist within services provided at the primary care level. While vertical investments have been prioritized to benefit specific health services, a comprehensive systems approach to primary health care needs to be further strengthened to reach Ghana's Universal Health Coverage objectives.",0,0,Health systems; systems evaluation; health policy; universal health coverage; primary health care; ACHIEVE; PROGRAM; IMPACT,Article
Costs and revenues of specialized palliative care in the outpatient and inpatient sector,"Melching, Heiner; SPRINGER HEIDELBERG; Melching, Heiner; Melching, Heiner",2022,ONKOLOGIE,10.1007/s00761-022-01244-2,WOS:000865785700002,Germany,"If the question of whether specialized palliative care pays off is understood in such way that the effort and costs are well proportioned to the benefits to those affected and to society, the answer to this question is clearly yes. The clear focus on the needs of those affected, which also includes relatives, and which often goes hand in hand with the omission of useless, unwanted, and often expensive diagnostic procedures and therapies, makes palliative care a highly economic form of care. In our healthcare system, which has been increasingly economized for decades, the question of whether something ""pays off"" is usually understood as whether the proceeds are favorable in relation to the costs by which profit can be made. However, especially in the German hospital system, it is easier to achieve surpluses with cost-intensive interventions than with a type of care in which the costs for staff account for the largest share. Therefore, the ""problem"" for business people is not that palliative medicine is too expensive, but rather that it is too cheap in certain areas. In general, no universal statement can be made about how lucrative specialized palliative care is. In particular, the outpatient and inpatient areas must be considered differently due to the different systems. Only in the case of multiprofessional palliative services in hospitals can it be stated that this increasingly important area is currently not regularly reimbursed to cover costs. On the other hand, palliative care units can be designed to cover costs and still ensure a high level of quality, especially if ""secondary profits"" are taken into account.",0,0,Palliative care unit; Inpatient palliative services; Outpatient palliative services; Funding; Efficiency,Article
Strengthening resilience and patient safety in healthcare institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experience from a quasi-medical center,"Chen, Szu-Ying; Wang, Shih-Hao; Wang, Yi-Ming; Huang, Yu-Wei; Chi, Shu-Ching; ELSEVIER TAIWAN; Chen, Szu-Ying; Wang, Yi-Ming; Huang, Yu-Wei; Chen, Szu-Ying; Chen, Szu-Ying; Huang, Yu-Wei; Wang, Shih-Hao; Huang, Yu-Wei; Chi, Shu-Ching; Wang, Shih-Hao; Wang, Yi-Ming; Chi, Shu-Ching; Chi, Shu-Ching; Yuwei, Huang; Chen, Szu-Ying",2024,JOURNAL OF THE FORMOSAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,10.1016/j.jfma.2024.09.035,WOS:001351476400007,Taiwan,"The COVID-19 global pandemic exposed healthcare system vulnerabilities, further endangering patient safety. This article explores perspectives on resilience and patient safety among healthcare workers using data from the Taiwan Patient Safety Culture Survey (TPSCS) and implementing Patient Safety Leadership Walkrounds (PSLWs) at E-Da Hospital. In 2021 and 2022, 1340 and 1114 staff members from clinical departments completed TPSCS questionnaires, respectively. 89 leaders from clinical departments participated in PSLWs in 2022. Among the four job categories, scores of Safety Attitude Questionnaire (SAQ) were lower among nurses and medical technicians, while perceptions of resilience and work-life balance were lowest among nurses. Between the two-year surveys, nurses exhibited significant decreases in SAQ in 2022 compared to 2021, while perceptions of work condition and work-life balance significantly declined among pharmacists. Resilience perception significantly decreased among all job categories except physicians during the pandemic. Mediation analyses showed teamwork climate, job satisfaction, management, work condition, and work-life balance were directly associated with safety climate, while resilience acts as a mediator, indirectly potentiating these relationships. Through PSLWs, we identified concerns about patient safety, including workforce, systems, processes, equipment, and work environment. Among these, workforce shortages and unsatisfactory pay emerged as the most pressing challenges. Strong leadership was recognized as a crucial factor in enhancing resilience and patient safety. This study suggests that TPSCS and PSLWs are worth regularly promoting among hospital institutions. Additionally, our findings highlight the urgency of healthcare organizations and governmental agencies to undertake policy reforms to improve healthcare workers' well-being.",0,0,Resilience Patient safety; Leadership walkrounds; COVID-19; National health insurance; LEADERSHIP WALKROUNDS; SYSTEM RESILIENCE; NURSES; IMPACT,Review
Breast cancer in Thailand: policy and health system challenges to universal healthcare,"Lakha, Fatim; Suriyawongpaisul, Paibul; Sangrajrang, Suleeporn; Leerapan, Borwornsom; Coker, Richard; OXFORD UNIV PRESS; Lakha, Fatim; Coker, Richard; Suriyawongpaisul, Paibul; Leerapan, Borwornsom; Sangrajrang, Suleeporn; Lakha, Fatim; Leerapan, Borwornsom; Lakha, Fatim",2020,HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING,10.1093/heapol/czaa063,WOS:000615925000003,England; Thailand,"Thailand has successfully implemented Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and embedded the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into its Thailand 4.0 policy. Breast cancer is a growing challenge in Thailand, as it is globally. It serves as a perfect medium through which to interrogate UHC and demonstrate areas of the health system which require further strengthening if UHC is to be sustainable in the longer term. We conducted a situation analysis and used a Systemic Rapid Assessment (SYSRA) framework to examine the challenges posed to UHC through the lens of breast cancer. We identified a number of challenges facing UHC including (1) continued political commitment; (2) the need for coordinated scale-up of strategic investments involving increased financing and fine-tuning of the allocation of resources according to health needs; (3) reducing inequities between health insurance schemes; (4) investing in innovation of technologies, and more critically, in technology transfer and capacity building; (5) increasing capacity, quality and confidence in the whole primary healthcare team but especially family medicine doctors. This would subsequently increase both efficiency and effectiveness of the patient pathway, as well as allow patients wherever possible to be treated close to their homes, work and family; (6) developing and connecting information systems to facilitate understanding of what is working, where needs are and track trends to monitor improvements in patient care. Our findings add to an existing body of evidence which suggest, in light of changing disease burden and increasing costs of care, a need for broader health system reforms to create a more enabling platform for integrated healthcare as opposed to addressing individual challenging elements one vertical system at a time. As low- and middle-income countries look to realize the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals and sustainable UHC this analysis may provide input for policy discussion at national, regional and community levels and have applicability beyond breast cancer services alone and beyond Thailand.",0,0,Health system strengthening; universal healthcare; breast cancer; equity; challenges; MENTAL-HEALTH; SCALING-UP; COVERAGE; COUNTRIES; SURVIVAL; EXPERIENCE; MORTALITY; PAYMENTS,Article

H.; Siu, Andrew M. H.; Siu, Andrew; Siu, Andrew M. H.",2019,JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2018.10.004,WOS:000468282600010,Peoples R China,"This paper reviews the prevalence, risk factors, and effectiveness of prevention programs for self-harm and suicide among children and adolescents in Hong Kong. Youth suicide rates declined gradually over the past two decades, but it is alarming to see that self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and attempts are quite common among junior secondary students. Local studies identify psychopathology (especially depression) and family relationship issues as the most common risk factors of suicide and self-harm, and impulsive control issues are an additional factor contributing to self-harm. In the second part, this paper reviews the evidence for six types of universal and selective prevention strategies identified from local and overseas literature: (1) restriction of access to means of suicide; (2) guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicides; (3) provision of quality mental healthcare to atrisk populations; (4) school-based screening and prevention programs; (5) online prevention, monitoring, and support programs; and (6) life skills training programs. Research evidence supports that the provision of high-quality mental health services to at-risk populations and some school-based prevention programs (awareness and screening, and gatekeeper training) are effective in suicide prevention. Further research efforts are needed to verify the impact of the other four strategies. Practitioners could make better use of new prevention programs through the internet and instant messaging platforms, which have the potential to alter attitude toward suicide and self-harm as well as promoting help seeking behavior among young people.

Health services utilization of Chinese patients with Huntington's disease: a cross-sectional study,"Ke, Huiyi; Cao, Xi; Song, Yanyan; Cao, Li; BMC; Ke, Huiyi; Cao, Li; Ke, Huiyi; Cao, Xi; Cao, Li; Song, Yanyan; Cao, Li; Cao, Li; Cao, Li; Cao, Li; Cao, Li; Cao, Li; deng, yan",2021,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,10.1186/s12913-021-06826-1,WOS:000685139100001,Peoples R China,"Background Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary disease which could have a large impact on patients' quality of life. As the neurodegenerative disorders progress, HD patients are expected to regularly take follow-up medical visits for proper treatment. This study aimed to analyze the general situation of health services utilization of Chinese HD patients and factors associated with their adherence to follow-up medical visits. Methods We collected data from a questionnaire-based investigation conducted by the Chinese Huntington's Disease Association. Data from 232 respondents were included to investigate whether they adhered to regular follow-up medical visits and the influencing factors. Based on Andersen's behavioral model, the independent variables were categorized into predisposing, enabling and need factors. The variables were analyzed by chi-square test and stepwise logistic regression analysis. Results Thirty-one point nine percent of the respondents had regular follow-up medical visits over the past year. Univariate analysis showed that there were significant differences with 6 factors (P < 0.05), among which, according to logistic regression, 2 enabling factors (reimbursement of health insurance, need for accompanying family members to follow-up visits) and 3 need factors (perceived stage of disease, perceived effectiveness of drugs, self-care ability) were independent influencing factors of follow-up medical behaviors of Chinese HD patients. The predisposing factors investigated here did not play a part in determining patients' adherence to follow-up visits. Conclusions Poor adherence to medical visits among Chinese HD patients is derived from multiple factors, including reimbursement of health insurance, perceived stage of disease and effectiveness of drugs, need for accompanying family members and self-care ability. To promote HD patients' health services utilization, the improvement of the health insurance system, the enhancement of social support and the development of therapeutic approaches still have a long way to go.",0,0,Huntington's disease; Health services utilization; Andersen's behavioral model; Follow-up medical visits; BEHAVIORAL-MODEL; ACCESS; COSTS; CARE,Article

Objectives This study looks at the primary care attributes of AAMC from a patient perspective, to assess their features, strengths and weaknesses. Methods Using a primary care survey tool, a cross-sectional survey of 360 users was conducted at 18 facilities across 9 districts of Delhi to gather information on six dimensions of primary care delivery. Thematic analysis of responses to quantitative, multiple-choice and Likert scale questions using percentage of respondents in each category; and a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and suggestions (SWOS) framework, was used to examine the primary care attributes. Results AAMCs have done well in improving proximity, availability, physical and financial access to primary care with respondents reporting their residence within 1 kilometre of AAMCs (95%), physician being available (100%), free drugs in stock (99%). Service delivery is however not comprehensive with missing preventive care. Respondents reported missing gatekeeping, weak referral mechanism (6-19%), and low physician's familiarity with their overall health (2%). Conclusion AAMCs have brought affordable healthcare with free medicines and diagnostics to neighbourhood. There is an opportunity for attaining universal healthcare that is responsive to user needs through provision of comprehensive care.

The time spent on preparing or administering trastuzumab by different healthcare professionals (HCPs) was recorded. The data were analysed by descriptive/inferential statistical analyses, followed by thematic analyses.SettingOutpatient and inpatient administration units of a single medical centre in Taiwan.ParticipantsThe study included patients with early-stage BC who received subcutaneous or intravenous trastuzumab (n=93), and HCPs including two attending physicians, a nurse practitioner, two pharmacists and two nurses.ResultBased on the perspectives of patients and HCPs, the subcutaneous form of trastuzumab was more efficient, less expensive and produced less discomfort in outpatient units than inpatient units. More participants preferred the subcutaneous form over the intravenous form in both outpatient and inpatient units. Pharmacists and nurse practitioners spent threefold more time on patients when preparing and administering the intravenous form in both outpatient and inpatient units. The concerns raised by patients and HCPs varied in certain aspects, including the injection skills, speed, mental distress (eg, needle phobia) and pain associated with the subcutaneous form. Almost all patients preferred receiving the subcutaneous form in outpatient units after the initial COVID-19 outbreak.ConclusionPatients with early-stage BC preferred receiving subcutaneous trastuzumab in outpatient units rather than inpatient units or the intravenous form before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Such findings may serve as real-world evidence to facilitate better quality of care regarding administration of subcutaneous or intravenous trastuzumab in medical settings, and its feasible resolutions to balance the quality, concerns and efficiency of anticancer administration during the COVID-19 pandemic.",0,0,cancer pain; quality in health care; health & safety; RESOURCE UTILIZATION; COST; ONCOLOGY,Article

However, a major challenge lies in the strong separation of healthcare structures, which hinders efficient interprofessional and intersectoral communication and collaboration. The mandatory nationwide implementation of the telematics infrastructure may offer a solution to enhance healthcare professionals' communication and collaboration.Objective Our study aims to elicit participants' perceptions of and attitudes towards the implementation and usage of the telematics infrastructure in fostering interprofessional communication and collaboration between home-care nursing services and general practitioner practices.Methods We conducted interviews with seven members of general practitioner practices and 10 in home-care nursing services. Using thematic content analysis, we identified five themes, of which four along with 10 subthemes were integrated into Greenhalgh et al.'s 'nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread and sustainability' framework.Results Participants recognised the potential of digital technology to enhance interprofessional communication and collaboration. However, this potential largely depended on individual healthcare actors' willingness to seek information, invest and adapt. Attitudes towards the telematics infrastructure varied widely from hopeful confidence to outright rejection. Home-care nursing services generally viewed the telematics infrastructure with optimism, while general practitioners expressed reservations, particularly due to technological disruptions, lack of user-friendliness, and organisational structures.Conclusion Our findings highlight the potential of digital technology to enhance interprofessional communication. Successful implementation of technological innovations, however, goes beyond technological aspects and involves social, political and organisational processes. Future implementation strategies for such innovations in healthcare should involve users early and ensure clear communication.",0,0,Nurses; general practitioner; communication; collaboration; ambulant care; health telematics; eHealth strategy; INTERPROFESSIONAL COLLABORATION; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT,Article

This study assumes that health care insurance will subsidise e-visit service costs, in which case, identifying patients who benefit most from e-visit service is essential. Using a large data set from Taiwan's National Health Insurance, this study verifies the efficiency and validity of the DTEVCA. Results indicate that this approach can accurately classify in-office clinic visits that could switch to e-visit services. The straightforward rules of this decision tree also give insurance agencies a clear guideline to understand the circumstances of using e-visits and predict the effects of implementing e-visits in Taiwan. Result of this study can help countries improve the policy formulation process for physicians' use, or for academic research. The DTEVCA can update classification rules using new data to correct biases and ensure the stability of the e-visit system. In addition, the concept of this approach is feasible not only for e-visit service but also for other 'new services' such as new products or new policies.",0,0,E-visit; healthcare analytics; data classification; decision tree; health care insurance; data mining; CARE; SATISFACTION; TELEMEDICINE; EVISITS; COSTS,Article

The SOP model (Shared decision making with Oncologists and Palliative care specialists) aimed to increase the rate of documentation on the preferences for DNR and ANH in patients with advanced cancer. Methods The SOP model was implemented in a national cancer treatment center in Taiwan from September 2016 to August 2018 for patients with advanced cancer visiting the oncology outpatient clinic. The framework was based on the model of shared decision making as ""choice talk"" initiated by oncologists with ""option talk"" and ""decision talk"" conducted by palliative care specialists. Results Among 375 eligible patients, 255 patients (68%) participated in the model testing with the mean age of 68.5 +/- 14.7 years (mean +/- SD). Comparing to 52.3% of DNR documentation among patients with advanced cancer who died in our hospital, the rate increased to 80.9% (206/255) after the decision talk in our model. Only 6.67% (n = 17) of the participants documented their preferences on ANH after the model. A worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status was the only statistically significant associating factor with a higher rate of DNR documentation in the multiple logistic regression model. Conclusions The SOP model significantly increased the rate of DNR documentation in patients with advanced cancer in this pilot study.

Since the implementation of this system, patients have been required to pay for some medicines to limit costs to the system. More recently, as they have faced constant increases in health insurance fees and also faced an increase in the number of medical expenses they must pay during an economic recession and a rise in unemployment, would the economic burden on the people of Taiwan not be increased? Even though National Health Insurance is a form of social insurance, does it guarantee social equality? The value of the healthcare industry is irreplaceable, so the most critical concern is whether worsening doctor-patient relationships will worsen healthcare quality. In short, while the global budget system saves on National Health Insurance costs, whether its implementation has affected healthcare quality is also worth exploring. This commentary also hopes to serve as a reference for the implementation of national health insurance in the United States.

To this end, health information systems have been implemented in hospitals, with this implementation representing progress in medicine and information technologies. As a result, life expectancy has significantly increased, standards in healthcare have been raised, and public health has improved. This progress is influenced by the process of managing healthcare organizations and information systems. While hospitals tend to adapt health information systems to reduce errors related to patient misidentification, the rise in the occurrence and recording of medical errors in Lebanon resulting from failures to correctly identify patients reveals that such measures remain insufficient due to unknown factors. This research aimed to investigate the effect of health information systems (HISs) and other factors related to work-related conditions on reductions in patient misidentification and related consequences. The empirical data were collected from 109 employees in Neioumazloum Hospital in Lebanon.

In this context, structures are represented by 2 welfare states: Taiwan, an East Asian welfare system and Finland, a Nordic welfare state. This study explores multidimensional care poverty rates and examines 3 realms of individual factors (health status, sociodemographic factors, and care support availability) among older adults in these long-term care (LTC) models.Research Design and Methods We analyzed data from the 2019 Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Ageing Survey and the 2020 Daily Life and Care in Old Age Survey in Finland to compare the rates and factors of care poverty in these 2 culturally and structurally different countries.Results Our analysis revealed different rates of care poverty in personal, practical, and socioemotional care needs in the 2 countries. Under a familistic welfare regime, Taiwanese older adults had higher personal care poverty rates than their Finnish counterparts. Those living alone faced more personal and practical care poverty. Conversely, Finnish older adults, under the Nordic welfare model, experienced more practical and socioemotional care poverty. Those with high care needs and disadvantaged social status and support were more likely to experience personal and practical care poverty. Socioemotional care poverty varied with the availability of support and health status in both countries.Discussion and Implications The study highlights the impact of 2 LTC policies and cultures on older adults' multidimensional care poverty, identifying disadvantaged older adults under different welfare-transforming LTC models. Taiwan's budget-constrained LTC policies and high family reliance contrast with Finland's inadequate attention to the practical and socioemotional needs of its aging population. This study suggests that holistic LTC policies are needed in both countries to improve the well-being of older adults with limited support and health issues.",0,0,Personal care; Practical care; Socioemotional care; Unmet needs; Welfare state comparison; LONG-TERM-CARE; UNMET NEEDS; PERSONAL ASSISTANCE; WELFARE-STATE; LONELINESS; SERVICES; PEOPLE; LIFE; ELDERCARE; TAIWAN,Article

In addition, a total of 15,253 COVID-19 related deaths were re-ported. During these three years, the government and health authority did many efforts to response this pandemic. In the early pandemic, Taiwan Central Epidemic Command Center was established in the early 2020 to organize associated resource, develop effective policy and implement strict intervention. In response to COVID-19 pandemic, many infection control policy and interventions, including universal mask wearing with increasing production of face mask, hand hygiene, border control, introduce of digital technology incorporating big data, quarantine of COVID-19 cases, travel and gathering restriction, were implemented. In the meanwhile, two COVID-19 vaccines, namely MVC-COV1901 and UB-612, have been developed under the support of government. Furthermore, MVC-COV1901 was taken into clinical practice after received emergency use approval. In addition, two traditional Chinese medicines, including NRICM101 and NRICM102 showed their promising effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and were recommended as potential therapeutic options for COVID-19. During the pandemic, the nonpharmacologic intervention help reduce many infectious diseases, especially for airborne/droplet-transmitted diseases.

Although the consequences of poor air quality are more severe in developing countries, they also have a critical impact in developed countries. Healthcare costs due to air pollution reach $150 billion in the USA, whereas particulate matter causes 412,000 premature deaths in Europe, every year. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), indoor air pollutant levels can be up to 100 times higher in comparison to outdoor air quality. Indoor air quality (IAQ) is in the top five environmental risks to global health and well-being. The research community explored the scope of artificial intelligence (AI) in the past years to deal with this problem. The IAQ prediction systems contribute to smart environments where advanced sensing technologies can create healthy living conditions for building occupants. This paper reviews the applications and potential of AI for the prediction of IAQ to enhance building environment and public health. The results show that most of the studies analyzed incorporate neural networks-based models and the preferred evaluation metrics are RMSE, R-2 score and error rate. Furthermore, 66.6% of the studies include CO2 sensors for IAQ assessment. Temperature and humidity parameters are also included in 90.47% and 85.71% of the proposed methods, respectively. This study also presents some limitations of the current research activities associated with the evaluation of the impact of different pollutants based on different geographical conditions and living environments.

Sinus rhythm restoration could reduce late mortality of atrial fibrillation patients. The Maze procedure is the gold standard for surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation. Higher surgical volume has been documented with favorable outcomes of various cardiac procedures such as mitral valve surgery and aortic valve replacement. We aimed to determine the volume-outcome relationship (i.e., association between surgical volume and outcomes) for the concomitant Maze procedure during major cardiac surgeries.MethodsThis nationwide population-based cohort study retrieved data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Adult patients undergoing concomitant Maze procedures during 2010-2017 were identified; consequently, 2666 patients were classified into four subgroups based on hospital cumulative surgery volumes. In-hospital outcomes and late outcomes during follow-up were analyzed. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze the volume-outcome relationship.ResultsPatients undergoing Maze procedures at lower-volume hospitals tended to be frailer and had higher comorbidity scores. Patients in the highest-volume hospitals had a lower risk of in-hospital mortality than those in the lowest-volume hospitals [adjusted odds ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.15-0.61; P < 0.001]. Patients in the highest-volume hospitals had lower rates of late mortality than those in the lowest-volume hospitals, including all-cause mortality [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.53; 95% CI 0.40-0.68; P < 0.001] and all-cause mortality after discharge (aHR 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.80; P < 0.001).ConclusionsA positive hospital volume-outcome relationship for concomitant Maze procedures was demonstrated for in-hospital and late follow-up mortality. The consequence may be attributed to physician skill/experience, experienced multidisciplinary teams, and comprehensive care processes. We suggest referring patients with frailty or those requiring complicated cardiac surgeries to high-volume hospitals to improve clinical outcomes.Trial registration: the institutional review board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital approved all data usage and the study protocol (registration number: 202100151B0C502).",0,0,Atrial fibrillation; Surgical ablation; Volume-outcome; Maze procedures; Survival analysis; AORTIC-VALVE-REPLACEMENT; HOSPITAL VOLUME; OPERATIVE RISK; SURVIVAL; PERFORMANCE; CONCOMITANT; MORTALITY; SURGERY; TRENDS,Article

This study explored multidisciplinary team care in hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma patients from the time of diagnosis to the first-time treatment interval and investigated treatment outcomes and prognosis.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study included data from a nationwide population from 2007 to 2016. Data were collected from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Database, linked to the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Propensity score matching was applied at a ratio of 1:2 to reduce the selection bias. A multiple regression model with generalized estimating equations was used to analyze whether multidisciplinary team care affected the diagnosis-to-treatment interval. The stratified Cox proportional hazards model examined whether involvement in multidisciplinary team care influenced survival status.ResultsA total of 10,928 and 21,856 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma received multidisciplinary and non-multidisciplinary care, respectively.

Objectives: This research aimed to investigate the current situation regarding palliative care and the important factors that influence its utilization by inpatients (including inpatients with and without cancer) at the end of their lives. We also explored the feasibility of establishing a prediction model of palliative care utilization for inpatients at the end of their lives. These findings will allow medical staff to monitor and focus on those who may require palliative care, resulting in more end-of-life patients receiving palliative care and thereby reducing medical expense and improving their quality of life. Methods: This was a retrospective study based on real-world health information system (HIS) data from 5 different branches of Taipei City Hospital between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018 that enrolled a total of 1668 deceased inpatients. To explore palliative care utilization at the end of life, we used 5-fold cross-validation in four different statistical models to obtain the performance of predictive accuracy: logistic regression (LGR), classification and regression tree (CART), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), and gradient boosting (GB). The important variables that may affect palliative care utilization by inpatients were also identified. Results: The results were as follows: (1) 497 (29.8%) inpatients received palliative care; (2) the average daily hospitalization cost of patients with cancer who received palliative care (NTD 5789 vs. NTD 12,115; p <= 0.001) and all patients who received palliative care (NTD 91,527 vs. NTD 186,981; p = 0.0037) were statistically significantly lower than patients who did not receive palliative care; (3) diagnosis, hospital, and length of stay (LOS) may affect palliative care utilization of inpatient; diagnosis, hospitalization unit, and length of hospitalization were statistically significant by LGR; (4) 51.5% of patients utilized palliative consultation services, and 48.5% utilized palliative care units; and (5) MARS had the most consistent results; its accuracy was 0.751, and the main predictors of palliative care utilization are hospital, medical expense, LOS, diagnosis, and Palliative Care Screening Tool-Taiwan version (TW-PCST) scores. Conclusions: The results reveal that palliative care utilization by inpatients remains low, and it is necessary to educate patients without cancer of the benefits and advantages of palliative care. Although data were limited, the predictability of the MARS model was 0.751; a better prediction model with more data is necessary for further research. Precisely predicting the need for palliative care may encourage patients and their family members to consider palliative care, which may balance both physical and mental care. Therefore, unnecessary medical care can be avoided and limited medical resources can be allocated to more patients in need.",0,0,palliative care utilization; machine learning methods; ADVANCED CANCER; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; CONSULTATION; COST; INTERVENTION; HOSPICE; COHORT; TEAMS; UNIT,Article

Aggressive sperm immobilization improves reproductive outcomes in patients with suboptimal semen parameters and previous ICSI fertilization failure,"Chou, Ching-Wen; Chen, Shee-Uan; Chang, Chin-Hao; Tsai, Yi-Yi; Huang, Chu-Chun; NATURE PORTFOLIO; Chou, Ching-Wen; Chen, Shee-Uan; Tsai, Yi-Yi; Huang, Chu-Chun; Chang, Chin-Hao; Chang, Chin-Hao; Huang, Chu-Chun; Chien, Sheng-Hsuan",2024,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/s41598-024-56092-4,WOS:001180029300123,Taiwan,"Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is the most effective procedure to resolve male infertility, enhancing overall fertilization and pregnancy outcomes. However, it is important to note that fertilization failure (FF) can still occur in a few cases after ICSI. This study aims to introduce a specialized technique of aggressive sperm immobilization for ICSI and evaluate its impact on reproductive outcomes in cases involving prior fertilization failure. All infertile couples with male partners having suboptimal semen samples and previous ICSI fertilization failure were evaluated using retrospective data from National Taiwan tertiary university hospital (NTUH) between January 2016 and February 2022. Fertilization failure in our study was defined as less than 30% fertilization rate (FR, the number of normally fertilized oocytes divided by the total number of injected mature oocytes). Data involving both standard (routine procedure) and aggressive sperm immobilization (SI) techniques during different ICSI cycles were included in this study. Standard and aggressive SI methods were performed by compressing the distal half tail of the spermatozoa <= 5 and 15 times prior to ICSI respectively. Generalized estimating equations analysis were applied to compare the clinical outcomes between two procedures. Overall, data from 23 infertile couples who had undergone 65 ICSI cycles (31 standard SI with low fertilization rate and 34 aggressive SI) were included in the study. The average FR in the ICSI cycles with standard SI and aggressive SI were 23.6 +/- 23.1% and 49.5 +/- 31.8 respectively (P = 0.0002). The majority of embryos were transferred at the day 3 stage, with an average number transferred of 2.6 +/- 0.9 in the aggressive SI group and 1.9 +/- 0.9 in the standard group. The number of embryos transferred per transfer cycle was higher in the aggressive SI (P = 0.015), whereas the number of good-quality embryos was similar between the two procedures (P = 0.44). There were one and seven live births from the standard SI cycles and aggressive SI cycles respectively. In conclusion, aggressive SI was associated with a significantly higher FR, resulting in more available embryos for transfer without compromising embryo quality. Therefore, this specialized technique improved pregnancy outcome among infertile couples with a previous ICSI-FF. It can be a safe, economic, and effective method to improve the assisted reproductive technologies outcomes for infertile patients affected by previous ICSI-FF.",0,0,ARTIFICIAL OOCYTE ACTIVATION; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; INJECTION; PREGNANCY; IMPLANTATION; SPERMATOZOA; DISRUPTION; TAIL; ODDS,Article

We calculated the utilization of healthcare services in the year 2016 for each study sample. Patients with MVP had more outpatient cardiological services during the year (5.3 vs. 0.7, p < 0.001) and higher outpatient cardiology costs (US$226.0 vs. US$30.8, p < 0.001) than patients without MVP. As expected, patients with MVP had a longer inpatient stay (0.5 vs. 0.1, p < 0.001) and higher inpatients costs (US$158.0 vs. US$22.9, p < 0.001) than patients without MVP for cardiology services. Furthermore, patients with MVP also had more outpatient non-cardiology services (20.8 vs. 16.5, p < 0.001) and associated costs (US$708.3 vs. US$518.7, p < 0.001) than patients without MVP in the year 2016. Multiple regression analysis indicated that patients with MVP had higher total costs for all healthcare services than patients without MVP after adjusting for the urbanization level, monthly income, and geographic region. This study demonstrated that healthcare utilization by patients with MVP is substantially higher than comparison patients.

In this mass casualty incident (MCI), although all emergency medical responses and care can be considered as a golden model in such an MCI, some EMS plans and strategies should be estimated impartially to understand the truth of the successful outcome. Factors like on-scene triage, apparent prehospital time (appPHT), inhospital time (IHT), and diversion rate were evaluated for the appropriateness of the EMS transportation plan in such cases. The patient diversion risk of inadequate EMS transportation to the first-arrival hospital is detected by the odds ratios (ORs). In this case, the effectiveness of the EMRC scenario is estimated by a decrease in appPHT. The average appPHTs (in minutes) of mild, moderate, and severe patients are 223.65, 198.37, and 274.55, while the IHT (in minutes) is 18384.25, 63021.14, and 83345.68, respectively. The ORs are: 0.4016 (95% Cl = 0.1032-1.5631), 0.1608 (95% Cl = 0.0743-0.3483), and 4.1343 (95% Cl = 2.3265-7.3468; P < .001), respectively. The appPHT has a 47.61% reduction by employing an EMRC model. Due to the relatively high appPHT, diversion rate, and OR value in severe patients, the EMS transportation plan is distinct from a prevalent response and develops adaptive weaknesses of MCIs in current disaster management. Application of the EMRC scenario reduces the appPHT and alleviates the surge pressure upon emergency departments in an MCI.",0,0,dust explosion; emergency medical regulation center (EMRC); emergency medical service (EMS); EMS transportation; mass casualty incident (MCI); ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; ON-SCENE TIME; MEDICAL-SERVICE; OBSERVATIONAL COHORT; PREHOSPITAL TIME; BOSTON MARATHON; CARDIAC-ARREST; BURN CASUALTY; TRAUMA; PERFORMANCE,Article

Despite their potential benefits, however, ACOs also raise significant antitrust concerns concerns that may pit consumer surplus and total surplus against one another. In an attempt to address these concerns, the Department of Justice and Fair Trade Commission announced that they will use market share screens and rule of reason treatment to evaluate ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. The use of market share screens and rule of reason treatment allows the antitrust agencies to avoid prioritizing either consumer surplus, or total surplus in the first instance but leaves open two critical questions: What will the rule of reason treatment afforded to ACOs look like? And how will the antitrust agencies ultimately determine whether ACOs benefit or harm consumers? In order to address these questions, this Note proposes that the antitrust agencies use the ""big data"" collected under the Affordable Care Act to conduct a structured rule of reason review of ACOs that takes into account both the consumer surplus and total surplus through a burden-shifting framework.",0,0,HEALTH-CARE; ANTITRUST; HOSPITALS; EFFICIENCY; WELFARE; MERGERS; PROFIT; REFORM; GOALS; LAW,Article

The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment used this opportunity to conduct the first randomized controlled study of a public insurance expansion. This analysis builds off of previous work by comparing rural and urban survey outcomes and adds qualitative interviews with 86 rural study participants for context. We examine health care access and use, personal finances, and self-reported health.

Understanding clinical practice in different health systems can identify areas for quality improvement initiatives to improve outcomes. In the absence of international comparison studies, we aimed to compare treatments and in-hospital outcomes of patients admitted with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by heart failure status in two healthcare-wide cohorts. Methods and resultsWe used two nationwide databases to capture admissions with STEMI in the United Kingdom (Myocardial ischemia National Audit Project, MINAP) and Japan (Japanese Registry of All Cardiac and Vascular Diseases-Diagnostic Procedure Combination, JROAD-DPC) between 2012 and 2017. Participants were stratified using the HF Killip classification into three groups; Killip 1: no congestive heart failure, Killip 2-3: congestive heart failure, Killip 4: cardiogenic shock. We calculated crude rate and case mix standardized risk ratios (CSRR) for use of treatments and in-hospital death. Patients were younger in the United Kingdom (65.4 [13.6] vs. 69.1 [13.0] years) and more likely to have co-morbidities in the United Kingdom except for diabetes and hypertension. Japan had a higher percentage of heart failure and cardiogenic shock patients among STEMI during admission than that in the United Kingdom. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) rates were lower in the United Kingdom compared with Japan, especially for patients presenting with Killip 2-3 class heart failure (pPCI use in patients with Killip 1, 2-3, 4: Japan, 86.2%, 81.7%, 78.7%; United Kingdom, 79.6%, 58.2% and 79.9%). In contrast, beta-blocker use was consistently lower in Japan than in the United Kingdom (61.4% vs. 90.2%) across Killip classifications and length of hospital stay longer (17.0 [9.7] vs. 5.0 [7.4] days). The crude rate of in-hospital mortality increased with increasing Killip class group. Both the crude rate and CSRR was higher in the United Kingdom compared with Japan for Killip 2-3 (15.8% vs. 6.4%, CSRR 1.80 95% CI 1.73-1.87, P < 0.001), and similar for Killip 4 (36.9% vs. 36.3%, CSRR 1.11 95% CI 1.08-1.13, P < 0.001). ConclusionsImportant differences in the care and outcomes for STEMI with heart failure exist between the United Kingdom and Japan. Specifically, in the United Kingdom, there was a lower rate of pPCI, and in Japan, fewer patients were prescribed beta blockers and hospital length of stay was longer. This international comparison can inform targeted quality improvement programmes to narrow the outcome gap between health systems.",0,0,ST elevation myocardial infarction; Heart failure; Medications; Mortality; ST-SEGMENT-ELEVATION; PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION; EUROPEAN-SOCIETY; HOSPITAL OUTCOMES; NATIONAL-REGISTRY; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; HETEROGENEITY; REPERFUSION; PREDICTORS,Article

A better understanding of the cost and benefit of P4P is needed to improve program assessment. To this end, we assessed the effect of a P4P program using a quasi-experimental intervention and control design. Two different intervention groups were used, one consisting of newly enrolled P4P patients, and another using P4P patients who have been enrolled since the beginning of the study. Patient-level data on clinical indicators, utilization and expenditures, linked with national death registry, were collected for diabetic patients at a large regional hospital in Taiwan between 2007 and 2013. Net value, defined as the value of life years gained minus the cost of care, is calculated and compared for the intervention group of P4P patients with propensity score-matched non-P4P samples. We found that Taiwan's implementation of the P4P program for diabetic care yielded positive net values, ranging from $40,084 USD to $348,717 USD, with higher net values in the continuous enrollment model. Our results suggest that the health benefits from P4P enrollment may require a sufficient time frame to manifest, so a net value approach incorporating future predicted mortality risks may be especially important for studying chronic disease management. Future research on the mechanisms by which the Taiwan P4P program helped improve outcomes could help translate our findings to other clinical contexts.",0,0,Pay-for-performance; National Health Insurance; Diabetes; Net value; Taiwan; HEALTH-CARE; QUALITY,Article

This cross-national, population-based study examined the extent and attributes of diabetes related avoidable hospitalizations (DRAHs) in South Korea and Taiwan, both of which have social health insurance-based health systems with limited gate-keeping for hospitalizations. We analyzed comparable, nationally representative health insurance beneficiary datasets for the two countries (2002-2013), linked with community health resource data. The age- and sex-standardized DRAH rates were calculated, and multivariate, multi-level longitudinal modeling approaches were adopted. The DRAH rate decreased in Taiwan consistently during 2002-2013 and in Korea after 2011 only. Under the universal health coverage, people enjoyed high accessibility to care. A higher number of physician visits reduced DRAHs in Korea but not in Taiwan. Socio-economic disparities in DRAHs still existed in both countries, especially in Taiwan. We found a different trajectory in two similar health systems for the selected health system performance indicator for primary diabetes care. This can be partly explained by different policy approaches to diabetes management in the two countries over the years. Necessary are policy efforts to improve the quality and equality of primary diabetes care and better control of hospital admissions in these two health systems that provide generous access to care at a low cost in East Asia.

Methods and Study Design: Participants from the Elderly Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (1999-2000) formed this cohort. Dietary information was collected by 24-hr recall and simplified food frequency questionnaire. Dietary quality was assessed by dietary diversity score (DDS, 0-6). Annual medical service utilization and expenditure were derived from National Health Insurance claims until 2006. Survivorship was ascertained from the National Death Registry until 2008. Cox proportional- hazards models were used to determine the association between aboriginality and mortality in conjunction with dietary diversity. Results: Indigenes (n=156) compared with nonindigenes (n=1182) significantly differed in socio-demography, behaviors and chronic disease prevalences. For up to 8 years, indigenes had a higher mortality rate (46.2% vs 33.6%, p=0.003). Indigenes' nutrient intakes were less for polyunsaturated fat, dietary fiber, vitamins and minerals (but more sodium); food intakes more for meat, with less cooking oil, dairy products and fruits; and a lower DDS, (3.61 vs 4.54). They had a 41% higher mortality risk (HR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.09-1.81, p=0.008). Control for demographic variables did not change the findings. However, the increase in HR was substantially attenuated by the inclusion of DDS (HR: 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88-1.49, p=0.316). There was no significant interaction between aboriginality and DDS on mortality (p=0.673). Conclusions: Older indigenous Taiwanese have a higher mortality risk than their majority counterparts. Irrespective of aboriginality, the more diverse diet is associated with a lower risk of mortality.",0,0,Indigenous; mortality; dietary diversity; Taiwan; NAHSIT; HEART-FAILURE HOSPITALIZATION; HEALTH; DISEASE; DETERMINANTS; EXPENDITURE; AUSTRALIA; SURVIVAL; QUALITY; PEOPLES,Article
Associations of continuity and coordination of care with outcomes and costs after discharge among patients with heart failure: A nationwide population-based study,"Chang, Guann-Ming; Chen, Jau-Yuan; Kuo, Wen-Yu; Tung, Yu-Chi; ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD; Chang, Guann-Ming; Kuo, Wen-Yu; Chen, Jau-Yuan; Kuo, Wen-Yu; Tung, Yu-Chi; Tung, Yu-Chi; Tung, Yu-Chi",2022,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY,10.1016/j.ijcard.2022.01.028,WOS:000784330500013,Taiwan,"Background: Although continuity and coordination of care have received increased attention as important ways to improve outcomes and decrease costs, limited information is available concerning the effects of ""care continuity"" and ""care coordination"" on mortality and costs. We used nationwide population-based data from Taiwan to explore the effects of care continuity and coordination on mortality and costs for heart failure. Methods: We analyzed all 18,991 heart failure patients 18 years of age or older and discharged from hospitals in 2016 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance claims data. Cox proportional hazard and multiple linear regression models were used, after adjustment for patient characteristics, to explore the relative impacts of the continuity of care (COC) index and care density on 1-year mortality and costs. Results: Higher COC index was associated with lower mortality (low vs. medium: hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.47-1.71; high vs. medium: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61-0.72) and costs (low vs. medium: cost ratio [CR], 1.11; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16; high vs. medium: CR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.81-0.88). Low care density was associated with higher mortality (low vs. medium: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.20). Higher care density was associated with lower costs (low vs. medium: CR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.10-1.18; high vs. medium: CR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.73-0.79). Conclusions: Low care continuity and coordination are associated with higher 1-year post-discharge mortality and costs.

Methods The unit of analysis was the hospital. We merged the hospital medication alert system adoption survey data and Taiwan National Health Insurance outpatient claims data. The observation time was 1998 to 2011, divided into 5 periods (T1-T5). The analysis included 216 hospitals, and outcome variable was hospital-based outpatient duplicated medication rates. The system adoption time frame, hospital accreditation level, and number of drugs per prescription were defined as predicted variables. A generalized estimating equation regression model was used. Results Adoption of the advanced medication alert system gradually increased, such that 100% of medical centers and 84% of regional hospitals, but less than 50% of district hospitals, had systems by T5. The hospital-based outpatient duplicated medication rate continually decreased, from 29.8% to 11.2%. The generalized estimating equation model showed rates of duplicated medications of b = -8.44 at T2 and b = -17.88 at T5 (P < 0.001) compared with T1. Medical centers and regional hospitals demonstrated much lower duplication rates (b = -13.71, b = -6.82; P < 0.001) compared with district hospitals. Hospitals with more medications per prescription had higher duplication rates than did hospitals with fewer items. Conclusions Hospitals accredited at higher levels tended to have advanced medication alert systems. Hospitals that implemented advanced systems decreased hospital-based outpatient duplicated medications, avoiding a potential risk due to inappropriate medication use.",0,0,medication alert system; duplicated medication; overlapping prescription; PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY; POTENTIALLY INAPPROPRIATE MEDICATION; ADVERSE DRUG-REACTIONS; DECISION-SUPPORT; ERROR; CARE; PREVALENCE; CONTINUITY; INCREASE; QUALITY,Article
The effectiveness of case management and nursing counselling among caregivers of patients with dementia: A pilot study,"Yu, Mei-Ling; Chen, Hung Ju; Chen, Kee-Hsin; Sung, Jia-Ying; WILEY; Yu, Mei-Ling; Chen, Hung Ju; Sung, Jia-Ying; Yu, Mei-Ling; Chen, Kee-Hsin; Chen, Hung Ju; Sung, Jia-Ying; Chen, Kee-Hsin; Sung, Jia-Ying; Sung, Jia-Ying; yu, meiling; Chen, Kee-Hsin; Chen, Kee-Hsin",2024,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,10.1002/hpm.3838,WOS:001295552700001,Taiwan,"According to the data released by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare in 2021, in 2019, 235,000 patients sought medical treatment for dementia-related diseases at the National-Health-Insurance-participating hospitals and clinics for more than three outpatient visits or had been hospitalised, and the number had increased by 15,000 from the previous year (Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2021). This implies that families are affected, causing tremendous physical, psychological, and economic pressures and burdens on the caregivers and families of the patient. The estimated social cost of caring for dementia families increased from $1.3 trillion in 2019 to $2.8 trillion in 2030 (World Health Organisation, 2021). Thus, long-term care for the dementia population has become a critical issue in medical care and social services in Taiwan and worldwide. In 2017, Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare has been starting Dementia care policy with 10 years long-term care plan through set up dementia care centre. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of dementia care centre for reducing the burden and improving the quality of life for caregivers of dementia patients. This pilot study adopts a quasi-experimental research design and uses purposive sampling to select in house informal caregivers of dementia patients who are part of a dementia collaborative care programme at a medical centre in the northern region and were willing to participate in this study. Upon enrolment in the study, subjects were given a pre-test, followed by a one-hour face-to-face nursing consultation and assessment after 2 weeks. Subsequently, a telephone nursing consultation was conducted once a month for 3 months. Two weeks after completing all counselling sessions, a post-test was administered to measure the caregiver burden with The Chinese version of the Caregiver Burden Inventory and the quality of life for caregivers with The 'Chinese Health Questionnaire CHQ-12'. After providing case management and nursing counselling, the total caregiver burden score significantly decreased from an average of 40.1 (SD = 21.6) at the pre-test to an average of 38.6 (SD = 21.4) at the post-test, reaching statistical significance (p < 0.01). The results of this study showed that providing dementia caregivers with case management and nursing consultation services helps improve the overall caregiver burden (particularly emotional burden and physical burden) as well as the health questionnaire scores. However, the social burden and time burden did not improve after receiving case management and counselling among caregivers; instead, post-test scores of these aspects were significantly higher.",0,0,caregiver burden; case management; dementia; nursing counselling; BURDEN,Article

Definitions with cut-offs in excess of z2 long-term conditions (LTCs) might better capture populations with complexity but are not standardised.Aim To examine variation in prevalence using different definitions of multimorbidity.Design and setting Cross-sectional study of 1 168 620 people in England.Method Comparison of multimorbidity (MM) prevalence using four definitions: MM2+ (z2 LTCs), MM3+ (z3 LTCs), MM3+ from 3+ (z3 LTCs from z3 International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision chapters), and mental-physical MM (z2 LTCs where z1 mental health LTC and z1 physical health LTC are recorded). Logistic regression was used to examine patient characteristics associated with multimorbidity under all four definitions.Results MM2+ was most common (40.4%) followed by MM3+ (27.5%), MM3+ from 3+ (22.6%), and mental-physical MM (18.9%). MM2+, MM3+, and MM3+ from 3+ were strongly associated with oldest age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 58.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 56.13 to 60.14; aOR 77.69, 95% CI = 75.33 to 80.12; and aOR 102.06, 95% CI = 98.61 to 105.65; respectively), but mental-physical MM was much less strongly associated (aOR 4.32, 95% CI = 4.21 to 4.43). People in the most deprived decile had equivalent rates of multimorbidity at a younger age than those in the least deprived decile. This was most marked in mental-physical MM at 40-45 years younger, followed by MM2+ at 15-20 years younger, and MM3+ and MM3+ from 3+ at 10-15 years younger. Females had higher prevalence of multimorbidity under all definitions, which was most marked for mental-physical MM.Conclusion Estimated prevalence of multimorbidity depends on the definition used, and associations with age, sex, and socioeconomic position vary between definitions.

Establishing and using reference intervals,"Ozarda, Yesim; WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH; Ozarda, Yesim; Ozarda, Yesim; Ozarda, Yesim; Ozarda, Yesim; Özarda, Yeşim",2020,TURKISH JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY-TURK BIYOKIMYA DERGISI,10.1515/tjb-2017-0299,WOS:000525736100001,Turkey,"Reference intervals (RIs) and clinical decision limits (CDLs) are fundamental tools used by healthcare and laboratory professionals to interpret patient laboratory test results. The traditional method for establishing RIs, known as the direct approach, is based on collecting samples from members of a preselected reference population, making the measurements and then determining the intervals. For challenging groups such as pediatric and geriatric age groups, indirect methods are appointed for the derivation of RIs in the EP28-A3c guideline. However, there has been an increasing demand to use the indirect methods of deriving RIs by the use of routine laboratory data stored in the laboratory information system. International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC), Committee on Reference Intervals and Decision Limits (C-RIDL) is currently working on the study for the comparison of the conventional (direct) and alternative (indirect) approaches for the determination of reference intervals. As a matter of fact that, the process of developing RIs is often beyond the capabilities of an individual laboratory due to the complex, expensive and time-consuming process to develop them. Therefore, a laboratory can alternatively transfer and verify RIs established by an external source (i.e. manufacturers' package inserts, publications). IFCC, C-RIDL has focused primarily on RIs and has performed multicenter studies to obtain common RIs in recent years. However, as the broader responsibility of the Committee, from its name, includes ""decision limits"", the C-RIDL also emphasizes the importance of the correct use of both RIs and CDLs and to encourage laboratories to specify the appropriate information to clinicians as needed.",0,0,Reference intervals; EP28-A3c guideline; Direct reference intervals; Multicenter studies; Indirect methods; IFCC; C-RIDL; Clinical decision limits; Verification of reference intervals; INDIVIDUAL BIOLOGICAL VARIATION; APPROVED RECOMMENDATION 1987; COMMON REFERENCE INTERVALS; REFERENCE VALUES; WORLDWIDE MULTICENTER; GLOBAL MULTICENTER; DERIVATION; LIMITS; NEED; TOOL,Review
Universal health coverage and equal access in Sweden: a century-long perspective on macro-level policy,"Fredriksson, Mio; BMC; Fredriksson, Mio; Fredriksson, Mio",2024,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH,10.1186/s12939-024-02193-5,WOS:001233940300001,Sweden,"Background When today's efforts to achieve universal health coverage are mainly directed towards low-income settings, it is perhaps easy to forget that countries considered to have universal, comprehensive and high-performing health systems have also undergone this journey. In this article, the aim is to provide a century-long perspective to illustrate Sweden's long and ongoing journey towards universal health coverage and equal access to healthcare.Methods The focus is on macro-level policy. A document analysis is divided into three broad eras (1919-1955; 1955-1989; 1989-) and synthesises seven points in time when policies relevant to overarching goals and regulation of universal health coverage and equal access were proposed and/or implemented. The development is analysed and concluded in relation to two egalitarian goals in the context of health: equality of access and equal treatment for equal need.Results Over the past century, macro-level policy evolved from the concept of creating access for the neediest and those reliant on wages for their survival to a mandatory insurance with equal right to healthcare for all. However, universal health coverage was not achieved until 1955, and individuals had to rely on their personal financial resources to cover the cost at the time of care utilization until the 1970s. It was not until 1983 that legislation explicitly stated that access to healthcare should be equal for the entire population (horizontal equity), while a vertical equity-principle was not added until 1997. Subsequently, ideas of free choice and privatization have gained significance. For instance, they aim to increase service access, addressing the Swedish health system's Achilles' heel in this regard. However, the principle of equal access for all is now being challenged by the emergence of private health insurance, which offers quicker access to services.Conclusions: brief summary and potential implications It can be concluded that there is no perpetual Swedish healthcare model and various dimensions of access have been the focus of policy discussion. The discussion on access barriers has shifted from financial to personal and organizational ones. Today, Sweden still ranks high in terms of affordability and equity in international comparisons: although not as well as a decade ago. Whether this marks the beginning of a new trend intertwined with a decline in Sweden's welfare 'exceptionalism', or is a temporary decline remains to be assessed in the future.",0,0,Universal health coverage; Equal access; Sweden; Swedish model; Horizontal equity; Vertical equity; WELFARE-STATE; CHOICE; CARE; EUROPE; EQUITY; WILL,Article
New governance of the digital health agency: a way out of the joint decision trap to implement electronic health records in Germany?,"Schmitt, Tugce; CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS; Schmitt, Tugce; Schmitt, Tugce; Schmitt, Tugce; Schmitt, Tugce; Schmitt, Tugce",2024,HEALTH ECONOMICS POLICY AND LAW,10.1017/S1744133123000142,WOS:001268436300005,Germany; Netherlands,"Fragmentation in health systems leads to discontinuities in the provision of health services, reduces the effectiveness of interventions, and increases costs. In international comparisons, Germany is notably lagging in the context of healthcare (data) integration. Despite various political efforts spanning decades, intersectoral care and integrated health data remain controversial and are still in an embryonic phase in the country. Even more than 2 years after its launch, electronic health record (elektronische Patientenakte; ePA) users in Germany constitute only 1 per cent of the statutorily insured population, and ongoing political debates suggest that the path to broader coverage is fraught with complexities. By exploring the main stakeholders in the existing (fragmented) health system governance in Germany and their sectoral interests, this paper examines the implementation of ePA through the lens of corporatism, offering insights based on an institutional decision theory. The central point is that endeavours to better integrate health data for clinical care, scientific research and evidence-informed policymaking in Germany will need to address the roles of corporatism and self-governance.",0,0,health data governance; electronic health records; institutionalism; corporatism; Germany; CARE; INTEGRATION,Article

Treatment might differ based on insurance type. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed National Inpatient Sample (NIS 2016) data to identify the impact of different types of insurances on mortality outcome in patients admitted with ACS. ICD-CM-10 codes were used to identify hospital discharges with a principal diagnosis of ACS. Observations were stratified based on insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, Private, and No insurance). Primary and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of stay and total cost. Any potential confounders were adjusted using multivariate logistic regression. STATA/IC 15.1 Stata Corp LLC was used for analysis. A total of 8,01,195 hospitalizations with the primary diagnosis of ACS were identified, of which 59.2% had Medicare, 9.72% had Medicaid, 26.8% had Private insurance, and 4.3% had no insurance. Higher odds of mortality were seen in the patients with Medicare, Medicaid, and Noninsured group. Adjusted Odds ratio for mortality in Medicare was 1.01 (confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-1.1; P = 0.65), in Medicaid was 1.16 (CI: 1.03-1.30; P = 0.01) and in uninsured group was 1.46 (CI: 1.26-1.69; P <= 0.01). However, the patients with private insurance adjusted odds ratio for mortality were 0.77 (CI: 0.70-0.84; P <= 0.01) compared to the patients with other insurance groups.

Feasibility Study on Energy Audit and Data Driven Analysis Procedure for Building Energy Efficiency: Bench-Marking in Korean Hospital Buildings,"Hwang, Dong Kon; Cho, Jinkyun; Moon, Junghwan; MDPI; Hwang, Dong Kon; Cho, Jinkyun; Moon, Junghwan; Cho, Jinkyun; Cho, Jinkyun",2019,ENERGIES,10.3390/en12153006,WOS:000482174800165,South Korea,"Growths in population, increasing demand for health care services and comfort levels, together with patients on the rise in time spent inside hospitals, assure the upward trend that energy demand will continue in the future. Since the hospital buildings operate 24 hours, 365 days a year for the treatment and restoration of patients, they are approximately 2-3 times more energy-intensive than normal buildings. For this reason, energy efficiency in hospitals is one of the prime objectives for energy policy at regional, national and international levels. This study aims to find how meaningful energy performance, reflecting good energy management and energy conservation measures (ECMs), can be operated for hospital buildings, a category encompassing complex buildings with different systems and large gaps between them. Energy audit allows us to obtain knowledge from the healthcare facility, in order to define and tune data driven analysis rules. The use of benchmarking in the energy audit of healthcare facilities enables immediate comparison between hospitals. Data driven energy analysis also allows ascertaining their expected energy consumption and estimating the possible savings margin by using the building energy flow chart. In the 2015-2017 periods, bench-marking of four public hospitals in Seoul were audited for the energy consumption related to weather conditions, total area, bed numbers, employee numbers, and analyzed for building energy flow by zones, energy sources, systems and equipment. This is a practice-based learning in a hospital project. The results reveal that the average annual energy consumption of a hospital under normal conditions, and energy efficiency factors are divided into energy baselines, energy consumption goals for energy saving and energy usage trends for setting ECMs, respectively. The indicator dependent on the area of inpatients (number of beds) proved to be the most suitable as a reference to quantify the energy consumption of a hospital.",0,0,hospital facility; ECMs: Energy conservation measures; energy audit; energy analysis; building energy flow chart; CONSUMPTION; SYSTEMS; SAVINGS,Article

DESIGN Retrospective cross sectional cohort study. SETTING Patient level administrative data from the United States, Canada (Ontario and Manitoba), England, the Netherlands, Israel, and Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS Adults aged 66 years and older admitted to hospital with STEMI or NSTEMI between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2017. OUTCOMES MEASURES The three categories of outcomes were coronary revascularisation (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery), mortality, and efficiency (hospital length of stay and 30 day readmission). Rates were standardised to the age and sex distribution of the US acute myocardial infarction population in 2017. Outcomes were assessed separately for STEMI and NSTEMI. Performance was evaluated longitudinally (over time) and cross sectionally (between countries). RESULTS The total number of hospital admissions ranged from 19 043 in Israel to 1 064 099 in the US. Large differences were found between countries for all outcomes. For example, the proportion of patients admitted to hospital with STEMI who received percutaneous coronary intervention in hospital during 2017 ranged from 36.9% (England) to 78.6% (Canada; 71.8% in the US); use of percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI increased in all countries between 2011 and 2017, with particularly large rises in Israel (48.4-65.9%) and Taiwan (49.4-70.2%). The proportion of patients with NSTEMI who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 90 days of admission during 2017 was lowest in the Netherlands (3.5%) and highest in the US (11.7%). Death within one year of admission for STEMI in 2017 ranged from 18.9% (Netherlands) to 27.8% (US) and 32.3% (Taiwan). Mean hospital length of stay in 2017 for STEMI was lowest in the Netherlands and the US (5.0 and 5.1 days) and highest in Taiwan (8.5 days); 30 day readmission for STEMI was lowest in Taiwan (11.7%) and the US (12.2%) and highest in England (23.1%).

A global call to action is needed to increase equitable access to care and the quality of care provided to critically ill patients. Current challenges to effective critical care in resource-constrained settings are many. Estimates of the burden of critical illness are extrapolated from common etiologies, but the true burden remains ill-defined. Measuring the burden of critical illness is epidemiologically challenging but is thought to be increasing. Resources, infrastructure, and training are inadequate. Millions die unnecessarily due to critical illness. Solutions start with the implementation of first-step, patient care fundamentals known as Essential Emergency and Critical Care. Such essential care stands to decrease critical-illness mortality, augment pandemic preparedness, decrease postoperative mortality, and decrease the need for advanced level care. The entire healthcare workforce must be trained in these fundamentals. Additionally, physician and nurse specialists trained in critical care are needed and must be retained as leaders of critical care initiatives, researchers, and teachers. Context-specific research is mandatory to ensure care is appropriate for the patient populations served, not just duplicated from high-resourced settings. Governments must increase healthcare spending and invest in capacity to treat critically ill patients.

Access to maternal health services for Indigenous women in low- and middle-income countries: an updated integrative review of the literature from 2018 to 2023,"Morgan, Julia; Breau, Genevieve M.; COLL MEDICINE & DENTISTRY, JAMES COOK UNIV TOWNSVILLE; Morgan, Julia; Breau, Genevieve M.; Morgan, Julia; Breau, Genevieve",2024,RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH,10.22605/RRH8520,WOS:001233265700001,England,"Introduction : Ninety-seven per cent of Indigenous Peoples live in low -and middle -income countries (LMICs). A previous systematic integrative review of articles published between 2000 and 2017 identified numerous barriers for Indigenous women in LMICs in accessing maternal healthcare services. It is timely given the aim of achieving Universal Health Coverage in six years' time, by 2030, to undertake another review. This article updates the previous review exploring the recent available literature on Indigenous women's access to maternal health services in LMICs identifying barriers to services. Methods : An integrative review of literature published between 2018 and 2023 was undertaken. This review followed a systematic process using Whittemore and Knafl's five -step framework for integrative reviews and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 944 articles were identified from six databases: Academic Search Premier, MEDLINE, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL Plus with Full Text and APA PsycArticles (through EBSCOhost). The search was undertaken on 16 January 2023. After screening of the title/abstract and the full text using inclusion and exclusion criteria 26 articles were identified. Critical appraisal resulted in 24 articles being included in the review. Data were extracted using a matrix informed by Penchansky and Thomas's taxonomy, extended by Saurman, which focused on six dimensions of access to health care: affordability, accessibility, availability, accommodation, acceptability and awareness. Ten studies took place in Asia, 10 studies were from the Americas and four studies took place in the African region. Seventeen articles were qualitative, two were quantitative and five were mixed methods. The methods for the integrative review were prespecified in a protocol, registered at Open Science Framework. Results : Barriers identified included affordability; community awareness of services including poor communication between providers and women; the availability of services, with staff often missing from the facilities; poor quality services, which did not consider the cultural and spiritual needs of Indigenous Peoples; an overreliance on the biomedical model; a lack of facilities to enable appropriate maternal care; services that did not accommodate the everyday needs of women, including work and family responsibilities; lack of understanding of Indigenous cultures from health professionals; and evidence of obstetric violence and mistreatment of Indigenous women. Conclusion : Barriers to Indigenous women's access to maternal health services are underpinned by the social exclusion and marginalisation of Indigenous Peoples. Empowerment of Indigenous women and communities in LMICs is required as well as initiatives to challenge the stigmatisation and marginalisation that they face. The importance of community involvement in design and interventions that support the political and human rights of Indigenous Peoples are required. Limitations of this review include the possibility of missing articles as it was sometimes unclear from the articles whether a particular group was from an Indigenous community. More research on access to services in the postnatal period is still needed, as well as quality quantitative research. There is also a lack of research on Indigenous groups in North Africa, and in sub-Saharan Africa - especially hunter -gatherer groups - as well as the impact of COVID-19 on access to services.",0,0,access to services; antenatal care s postnatal; childbirth; Indigenous women; low-and middle-income countries; maternal health services; postnatal care; OBSTETRIC CARE NAVIGATION,Review

However, limited studies have explored PCOD relative to socioeconomic status (SES) or health disparity. This review identified similar preferences and varied decision criteria in PCOD across SES groups. Methods: PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and relevant cross-references were searched for articles published between January 2007-September 2022. Papers were screened using Covidence. Included studies examined PCOD by income and/or educational levels. Analysis was performed in 2022-2023. Results: From 4,449 search results, 29 articles were selected (16 countries, 14 medical specialties, total of 32,651 participants). Individuals of higher SES ranked physician characteristics (e.g., qualifi- cations, empathy) or performance more important than cost or convenience. Individuals of lower SES often had to prioritize logistical factors (e.g., insurance coverage, distance) due to resource constraints and gaps in knowledge or awareness about options. Despite differing healthcare systems, such divergence in PCOD were relatively consistent across countries. Some patients, especially females and disadvantaged groups, favored gender-concordant physicians for intimate medical matters (e.g., gynecologist); this partiality was not limited to conservative cultures. Few researchers investigated the outcomes of PCOD and indicated that lower-SES populations inadvertently chose, experienced, or perceived lower quality of care. Discussion: Patients' decision criteria varied by SES, even under national systems intended for universal access, indicating the impacts of social determinants and structural inequities. Health education supporting patient decision-making and research on how SES affects PCOD and outcomes could help reduce health disparity. Am J Prev Med 2024;67(5):759-769. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

Performance-based financing (PBF) programs have been increasingly used to increase access to quality care in LMICs. However, evidence on the impacts of these programs remains fragmented and inconclusive. We analyze the health system impacts of the PBF program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), one of the largest such programs introduced in LMICs to date.MethodsWe used a health systems perspective to analyze the benefits of PBF relative to unconditional financing of health facilities. Fifty-eight health zones in six provinces were randomly assigned to either a control group (28 zones) in which facilities received unconditional transfers or to a PBF program (30 zones) that started at the end of 2016. Follow-up data collection took place in 2021-2022 and included health facility assessments, health worker interviews, direct observations of consultations and deliveries, patient exit interviews, and household surveys. Using multivariate regression models, we estimated the impact of the program on 55 outcomes in seven health system domains: structural quality, technical process quality, non-technical process quality, service fees, facility management, providers' satisfaction, and service coverage. We used random-effects meta-analysis to generate pooled average estimates within each domain.ResultsThe PBF program improved the structural quality of health facilities by 4 percentage points (ppts) (95% CI 0.01-0.08), technical process quality by 5 ppts (0.03-0.07), and non-technical process by 2 ppts (0-0.04). PBF also increased coverage of priority health services by 3 ppts (0.02-0.04). Improvements were also observed for facility management (9 ppts, 0.04-0.15), service fee policies, and users' satisfaction with service affordability (14 ppts, 0.07-0.20). Service fees and health workers' satisfaction were not affected by the program.ConclusionsThe results suggest that well-designed PBF programs can lead to improvements in most health systems domains relative to comparable unconditional financing. However, the large persisting gaps suggest that additional changes, such as allocating more resources to the health system and reforming the human resources for health management, will be necessary in DRC to achieve the ambitious global universal health coverage and mortality goals.Trial registrationAmerican Economics Association Trial registry AEARCTR-0002880.",0,0,Performance-based financing; Health systems; Quality of care; Maternal and child health; QUALITY; CARE; SERVICES; RWANDA,Article

Here we assessed the cost-effectiveness of BARI-REM versus REM in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the USA. Methods A three-state model was developed addressing costs and patient utility associated with COVID-19 hospitalization, immediate post hospital care, and subsequent lifetime medical care. Analysis was performed from the perspective of a payer and a hospital. Both perspectives evaluated two subgroups: all patients and patients who required oxygen. The primary measures of benefit in the model were patient quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued during and after hospitalization, cost per life years gained, cost per death avoided, and cost per use of mechanical ventilation avoided. Results In the base-case payer perspective with a lifetime horizon, treatment with BARI-REM versus REM resulted in an incremental total cost of $7962, a gain of 0.446 life years and gain of 0.3565 QALYs over REM. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of using BARI-REM were estimated as $22,334 per QALY and $17,858 per life year. The base-case and sensitivity analyses showed that the total incremental cost per QALY falls within the reduced willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY applied under health emergencies. In all hospitalized patients, treatment with BARI-REM versus REM reduced total hospital expenditures per patient by $1778 and total reimbursement payments by $1526, resulting in a $252 reduction in net costs per patient; it also resulted in a net gain of 0.0018 QALYs and increased survival of COVID-19 hospitalizations by 2.7%. Conclusion Our study showed that BARI-REM is cost-effective compared to using REM for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The base-case results of this cost-effectiveness model were most sensitive to average annual medical costs for recovered patients.",0,0,Baricitinib; Remdesivir; COVID-19; Cost-effectiveness; Hospital; Mechanical ventilation; METABOLIC SYNDROME; HEALTH,Article

Approximately 54% of individuals seeking LCS report current cigarette smoking. Effective smoking cessation interventions, offered at the time of LCS, enhances the health benefits of screening that are attributable to reductions in lung cancer overall and tobacco-related mortality. Considering these data, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) 2015 decision to cover LCS with LDCT required that radiology imaging facilities make tobacco cessation interventions available for people who smoke. In February 2022, CMS reversed their 2015 coverage requirement for delivering tobacco use treatment at the time of LDCT; CMS retained the requirement for counseling during the shared decision-making visit prior to the exam. The policy change does not diminish the importance of offering high-quality tobacco cessation services in conjunction with routine LDCT for LCS. However, LCS programs face a range of barriers to implementing tobacco use treatment in their settings. As a result, implementation has lagged. Closing the ""evidence to practice"" gap is the focus of implementation science, a field that offers a set of rigorous methods and a systematic approach to identifying and overcoming contextual barriers to implementing evidence-based guidelines in a range of clinical settings.

Factors Influencing Patient Experience in Pediatric Neurology,"Singh, Suprit C.; Sheth, Raj D.; Burrows, James F.; Rosen, Paul; ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC; Singh, Suprit C.; Sheth, Raj D.; Burrows, James F.; Rosen, Paul; Rosen, Paul; Rosen, Paul; Sheth, Raj D",2016,PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY,10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2016.04.002,WOS:000379889900005,USA,"INTRODUCTION: Hospitals have begun to shift toward patient-centered care because of the pay-for-performance system that was established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In pediatrics, the needs of both the caregiver and the pediatric patient have to be taken into account. Pediatric practices have been shifting toward a family-centered approach, although the primary drivers have not been well defined. Identifying the key patient experiences that lead to higher patient satisfaction would enable a more meaningful clinical encounter. To better understand patient experience, we examined waiting time and the elements of the physician patient interaction in pediatric neurology. We predict that the determining factor in patient satisfaction is the physician patient interaction. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Patient satisfaction surveys were sent to families via mail or e-mail after their ambulatory pediatric neurology visit. The visits took place between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014, at one of multiple locations in a children's health system spanning four states. A Likert scale was used for these surveys, and a top-box method (measuring percent of survey questions were rated 5 out of 5) was used to filter data from this database. Statistical analysis using a Pearson correlation was used for data analysis, with likelihood to recommend practice as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The five survey questions that correlated most with overall likelihood to recommend the practice were cheerfulness of practice (r = 0.79); staff working together (r = 0.76); cleanliness of practice (r = 0.70); wait time at clinic, from entering to leaving (r = 0.66); and likelihood of recommending care provider (r = 0.65).

Study Design We cross-sectionally assessed Hispanic-White, Black-White, and Asian-White disparities in 22 quality and utilization measures, comparing self-reported race and ethnicity to imputed values from the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) algorithm. Data Collection Race and ethnicity were obtained from self-reported data and imputed using BISG. Principal Findings 42.5%/4.9% of claims/EHR were missing self-reported data; BISG estimates were available for >99% of each and had good concordance (0.87-0.95) with Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White self-report. All estimated racial and ethnic disparities were statistically similar in self-reported and imputed EHR-based measures. However, within claims, BISG estimates and incomplete self-reported data yielded substantially different disparities in almost half of the measures, with BISG-based Black-White disparities generally larger than self-reported race and ethnicity data. Conclusions BISG imputation methods are feasible for Medicaid claims data and reduced missingness to <1%.

In this article we consider the different paths these two treatment systems have taken since 1965 and identify strategic lessons that the addiction treatment system might take from mental health's experience under Medicaid. These lessons include leveraging optional coverage categories to tailor Medicaid to the unique needs of the addiction treatment system, providing incentives to addiction treatment programs to create and deliver high-quality alternatives to inpatient treatment, and using targeted Medicaid licensure standards to increase the quality of addiction services.",0,0,SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; AFFORDABLE CARE ACT; TREATMENT PROGRAMS; UNITED-STATES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; ABUSE TREATMENT; MAINTENANCE; INSURANCE,Article

Academic health centers (AHCs), whose triple mission of clinical care, research, and education serves a critical role in the country's health care system, must adapt to this evolving environment. Doing so successfully, however, requires a broader understanding of the wide-ranging roles of the AHC. This article proposes a conceptual framework through which the triple mission is expanded along four new dimensions: health, innovation, community, and policy. Examples within the conceptual framework categories, such as the AHCs' safety net function, their contributions to local economies, and their role in right-sizing the health care workforce, illustrate how each of these dimensions provides a more robust picture of the modern AHC and demonstrates the value added by AHCs. This conceptual framework also offers a basis for developing new performance metrics by which AHCs, both individually and as a group, can be held accountable, and that can inform policy decisions affecting them. This closer examination of the myriad activities of modern AHCs clarifies their essential role in our health care system and will enable these institutions to evolve, improve, be held accountable for, and more fully serve the health of the nation.",0,0,HOSPITAL TEACHING INTENSITY; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; CARE; INTERVENTION; IMPROVEMENT; INNOVATION; MORTALITY; COMMUNITY; IMPACT,Article

The relationship between SDS and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) remains understudied. Methods: In a prospective, multi-institutional study, adult PwCF completed the 22-Question SinoNasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22), Smell Identification Test (SIT), Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorder Negative Statements (QOD-NS), and Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R). Lund-Kennedy scores, sinus computed tomography, and clinical data were collected. Data were analyzed across race/ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic factors using multivariate regression. Results: Seventy-three PwCF participated with a mean age of 34.7 +/- 10.9 years and 49 (67.1%) were female. Linear regression identified that elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI) use (beta = -4.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-6.08, -2.11], p < 0.001), female sex (beta = -2.14, 95% CI [-4.11, -0.17], p = 0.034), and increasing age (beta = -0.14, 95% CI [-0.22, -0.05], p = 0.003) were associated with lower/better endoscopy scores. Private health insurance (beta = 17.76, 95% CI [5.20, 30.32], p = 0.006) and >16 educational years (beta = 13.50, 95% CI [2.21, 24.80], p = 0.020) were associated with higher baseline percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1). Medicaid/Medicare insurance was associated with worse endoscopy scores, CFQ-R respiratory scores, and ppFEV1 (all p < 0.017), and Hispanic/Latino ethnicity was associated with worse SNOT-22 scores (p = 0.047), prior to adjustment for other cofactors. No other SDS factors were associated with SNOT-22, QOD-NS, or SIT scores. Conclusions: Differences in objective measures of CRS severity exist among PwCF related to sex, age, and ETI use. Variant status and race did not influence patient-reported CRS severity measures or olfaction in this study.

The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied as a quantitative tool. I examine three models using infant mortality and potential years of life lost as output indicators. These models differ only in the way of expressing healthcare inputs. The DEA computations show that neither the Bismarckian nor the Beveridgean healthcare system has a clear advantage over the other when inputs are expressed by health expenditure as a percentage of GDP. Themodelwhich uses USDper head expenditure data at purchasing power parity shows a slight advantage of the Beveridge-style systems. This confirms the common opinion that the Bismarck-style systems perform worse in controlling the costs. When inputs are expressed using physical units (medical staff and equipment), DEA shows that the Beveridge system is significantly more efficient than the Bismarckian ones. I analyse the relationship between the DEA scores and the country's GDP per capita, as well. This analysis shows that more developed economies are technically less efficient. These findings are consistent with the belief that technical efficiency is only one of the many criteria that determine the quality of the healthcare system and patient satisfaction.",0,0,healthcare systems; efficiency; DEA; economic welfare; DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; SLACKS-BASED MEASURE; COST DISEASE; POLITICS; CONTEXT; REFORMS; EUROPE; ACCESS; SCALE,Article

However, detailed empirical insight into why healthcare providers merge is lacking. Also, we know little about the influence of national healthcare policies on mergers. We fill this gap in the literature by conducting a survey study on mergers among 848 Dutch healthcare executives, of which 35% responded (resulting in a study sample of 239 executives). A total of 65% of the respondents was involved in at least one merger between 2005 and 2012. During this period, Dutch healthcare providers faced a number of policy changes, including increasing competition, more pressure from purchasers, growing financial risks, de-institutionalisation of long-term care and decentralisation of healthcare services to municipalities. Our empirical study shows that healthcare providers predominantly merge to improve the provision of healthcare services and to strengthen their market position. Also efficiency and financial reasons are important drivers of merger activity in healthcare. We find that motives for merger are related to changes in health policies, in particular to the increasing pressure from competitors, insurers and municipalities.",0,0,HOSPITAL MERGERS; COMPETITION; ACQUISITIONS; NETHERLANDS; REORGANIZATION; ORGANIZATIONS; CONSOLIDATION; PERFORMANCE; EFFICIENCY; OUTCOMES,Article

A comparison of the robust conditional order-m estimation and two stage DEA in measuring healthcare efficiency among California counties,"Gearhart, Richard S., III; Michieka, Nyakundi M.; ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV; Gearhart, Richard S., III; Michieka, Nyakundi M.; Gearhart, Richard S., III; Michieka, Nyakundi; Michieka, Nyakundi",2018,ECONOMIC MODELLING,10.1016/j.econmod.2018.04.015,WOS:000440771000031,USA,"This paper examines cross-county healthcare efficiency rankings using modem non-parametric estimators, while taking into account secondary environmental variables. Results indicate that output-direction efficiency estimates yield counties producing inefficiently for both order-alpha and order-m estimators. After accounting for a variety of secondary environmental variables, unconditional efficiency estimates improve by anywhere between 7.5 and 10-percentage points. Results show that there is little correlation between the highly visible Robert-Woods-Johnson Foundation estimates with those derived here. We also find that counties are more efficient when they possess lower rates of obesity, unemployment, and preventable hospital readmissions. In addition, demographic variables do not play much of a role in explaining cross-county inefficiency. The analysis shows that the two stage DEA is inappropriate and violates several assumptions in comparison to the conditional order-m estimation.",0,0,Conditional order-m estimator; Conditional efficiency; Order- alpha; California counties; Nonparametric econometrics; NONPARAMETRIC FRONTIER MODELS; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES; QUANTILE ESTIMATION; OECD COUNTRIES; RANKINGS; INEFFICIENCY; OBESITY; IMPACT,Article
INSURER COMPETITION IN HEALTH CARE MARKETS,"Ho, Kate; Lee, Robin S.; WILEY; Ho, Kate; Ho, Kate; Lee, Robin S.; Lee, Robin S.; Ho, Kate; Ho, Kate",2017,ECONOMETRICA,10.3982/ECTA13570,WOS:000403114800002,USA,"The impact of insurer competition on welfare, negotiated provider prices, and premiums in the U.S. private health care industry is theoretically ambiguous. Reduced competition may increase the premiums charged by insurers and their payments made to hospitals. However, it may also strengthen insurers' bargaining leverage when negotiating with hospitals, thereby generating offsetting cost decreases. To understand and measure this trade-off, we estimate a model of employer-insurer and hospital-insurer bargaining over premiums and reimbursements, household demand for insurance, and individual demand for hospitals using detailed California admissions, claims, and enrollment data. We simulate the removal of both large and small insurers from consumers' choice sets. Although consumer welfare decreases and premiums typically increase, we find that premiums can fall upon the removal of a small insurer if an employer imposes effective premium constraints through negotiations with the remaining insurers. We also document substantial heterogeneity in hospital price adjustments upon the removal of an insurer, with renegotiated price increases and decreases of as much as 10% across markets.",0,0,Health insurance; insurer competition; hospital prices; bargaining; countervailing power; ADVERSE SELECTION; INSURANCE MARKETS; BARGAINING POWER; VERTICAL MERGERS; HOSPITAL PRICES; INCENTIVES; CHOICE,Article

Using a large administrative change in reimbursements for surgical versus medical care, we find that private prices follow Medicare's lead. A $1.00 increase in Medicare's fees increases corresponding private prices by $1.16. A second set of Medicare fee changes, which generates area-specific payment shocks, has a similar effect on private reimbursements. Medicare's influence is strongest in areas with concentrated insurers and competitive physician markets, consistent with insurer-doctor bargaining. By echoing Medicare's pricing changes, these payment spillovers amplify Medicare's impact on specialty choice and other welfare-relevant aspects of physician practices.",0,0,HEALTH-CARE; MANAGED CARE; MARKET-SIZE; COST-SHIFT; COMPETITION; NETWORKS; INDUSTRY; INNOVATION; COVERAGE; PRICES,Article
THE PRICE AIN'T RIGHT? HOSPITAL PRICES AND HEALTH SPENDING ON THE PRIVATELY INSURED,"Cooper, Zack; Craig, Stuart V.; Gaynor, Martin; Van Reenen, John; OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC; Cooper, Zack; Craig, Stuart V.; Gaynor, Martin; Gaynor, Martin; Van Reenen, John; Van Reenen, John; Cooper, Zack; Van Reenen, John; Van Reenen, John",2019,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,10.1093/qje/qjy020,WOS:000489161300002,USA; England,"We use insurance claims data covering 28% of individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance in the United States to study the variation in health spending on the privately insured, examine the structure of insurer-hospital contracts, and analyze the variation in hospital prices across the nation. Health spending per privately insured beneficiary differs by a factor of three across geographic areas and has a very low correlation with Medicare spending. For the privately insured, half of the spending variation is driven by price variation across regions, and half is driven by quantity variation. Prices vary substantially across regions, across hospitals within regions, and even within hospitals. For example, even for a nearly homogeneous service such as lower-limb magnetic resonance imaging, about a fifth of the total case-level price variation occurs within a hospital in the cross section. Hospital market structure is strongly associated with price levels and contract structure. Prices at monopoly hospitals are 12% higher than those in markets with four or more rivals. Monopoly hospitals also have contracts that load more risk on insurers (e.g., they have more cases with prices set as a share of their charges). In concentrated insurer markets the opposite occurs-hospitals have lower prices and bear more financial risk. Examining the 366 mergers and acquisitions that occurred between 2007 and 2011, we find that prices increased by over 6% when the merging hospitals were geographically close (e.g., 5 miles or less apart), but not when the hospitals were geographically distant (e.g., over 25 miles apart).

Patient selection in the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model,"Ko, Hyunkyu; Martin, Brook, I; Nelson, Richard E.; Pelt, Christopher E.; WILEY; Ko, Hyunkyu; Martin, Brook, I; Pelt, Christopher E.; Nelson, Richard E.; Nelson, Richard E.; Ko, Hyunkyu; Ko, Hyunkyu; Ko, Hyunkyu",2022,HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,10.1111/1475-6773.13880,WOS:000703982400001,USA,"Objective To understand whether the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) program induces participating hospitals to (1) preferentially select lower risk patients, (2) reduce 90-day episode-of-care costs, (3) improve quality of care, and (4) achieve greater cost reduction during its second year, when downside financial risk was applied. Data sources We identified beneficiaries of age 65 years or older undergoing hip or knee joint replacement in the 100% sample of Medicare fee-for-service inpatient (Part A) claims from January 1, 2013 to August 31, 2017. Cases were linked to subsequent outpatient, Part B, home health agency, and skilled nursing facility claims, as well as publicly available participation status for CJR. Study design We estimated the effect of CJR for hospitals in the 67 metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) selected to participate in CJR (785 hospitals), compared to those in 104 non-CJR MSAs (962 hospitals; maintaining fee-for-service). A difference-in-differences approach was used to detect patient selection, as well as to compare 90-day episode-of-care costs and quality of care between CJR and non-CJR hospitals over the first two performance years. Data collection We excluded 172 hospitals from our analysis due to their preexisting BPCI participation. We focused on elective admissions in the main analysis. Principal findings While reductions in 90-day episode-of-care costs were greater among CJR hospitals (-$902, 95% CI: -$1305, -$499), largely driven by a 16.8% (p < 0.01) decline in 90-day spending in skilled nursing facilities, CJR hospitals significantly reduced the 90-day readmission rate (-3.9%; p < 0.05) and preferentially avoided patients aged 85 years or older (-5.9%; p < 0.01) and Black (-7.0%; p < 0.01). Cost reduction was greater in 2017 than in 2016, corresponding to the start of downside risk. Conclusions Participation in CJR was associated with a modest cost reduction and a reduction in 90-day readmission rates; however, we also observed evidence of preferential avoidance of older patients perceived as being higher risk among CJR hospitals.",0,0,bundled payment program; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement model; Medicare; patient selection; KNEE ARTHROPLASTY; BUNDLED PAYMENT; MEDICARE; ASSOCIATION; DISPARITIES; PROGRAM,Article
Driving blind: instituting SEP-1 without high quality outcomes data,"Wang, Jeffrey; Strich, Jeffrey R.; Applefeld, Willard N.; Sun, Junfeng; Cui, Xizhong; Natanson, Charles; Eichacker, Peter Q.; AME PUBLISHING COMPANY; Wang, Jeffrey; Strich, Jeffrey R.; Applefeld, Willard N.; Sun, Junfeng; Cui, Xizhong; Natanson, Charles; Eichacker, Peter Q.; Eichacker, Peter Q.; Sun, Junfeng",2020,JOURNAL OF THORACIC DISEASE,10.21037/jtd.2019.12.100,WOS:000507930600004,USA,"In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) instituted an all-or-none sepsis performance measure bundle (SEP-1) to promote high-quality, cost-effective care. Systematic reviews demonstrated only low-quality evidence supporting most of SEP-1's interventions. CMS has removed some but not all of these unproven components. The current SEP-1 version requires patients with suspected sepsis have a lactate level, blood cultures, broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if hypotensive, a fixed 30 mL/kg fluid infusion within 3 hours, and a repeat lactate if initially elevated within 6 hours. Experts have continued to raise concerns that SEP-1 remains overly prescriptive, lacks a sound scientific basis and presents risks (overuse of antibiotics and inappropriate fluids not titrated to need). To incentivize compliance with SEP-1, CMS now publicly publishes how often hospitals complete all interventions in individual patients. However, compliance measured across hospitals (5 studies, 48-2,851 hospitals) or patients (three studies, 110-851 patients) has been low (approximately 50%) which is not surprising given SEP-1's lack of scientific basis. The largest observational study (1,738 patients) reporting survival rates employing SEP-1 found they were not significantly improved with the measure (P=0.53) as did the next largest study (851 patients, adjusted survival odds ratio 1.36, 95% CI, 0.85 to 2.18). Two smaller observational studies (158 and 450 patients) reported SEP-1 improved unadjusted survival (P <= 0.05) but were confounded either by baseline imbalances or by simultaneous introduction of a code sepsis protocol to improve compliance. Regardless, retrospective studies have well known biases related to non-randomized designs, uncontrolled data collection and failure to adjust for unrecognized influential variables. Such low-quality science should not be the basis for a national mandate compelling care for a rapidly lethal disease with a high mortality rate. Instead, SEP-1 should be based on high quality reproducible evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) demonstrating its benefit and thereby safety. Otherwise we risk not only doing harm but standardizing it.",0,0,Sepsis; septic shock; treatment; management; bundle; performance measure; GOAL-DIRECTED RESUSCITATION; SEPTIC SHOCK; CRITICALLY-ILL; INTENSIVE-CARE; SEVERE SEPSIS; THERAPY; MEDICARE; ANTIBIOTICS; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT,Review

This system utilizes a nonlitigation expert review process to evaluate drug-injury relief applications, and 2,732 applications have been reviewed from 1999-2016. Of these, 1,572 applications received relief payments, an approval rate of 58%. Average review timeframes per application have decreased from 248 days (2003-2011) to 182 days (2012-2016). Most adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for approved cases involved skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (67%), with allopurinol being the primary culprit drug. A recent decline observed for such ADRs may reflect the influences of promotional activities and policy initiatives carried out according to informed analysis from drug-injury relief applications, which suggests that the drug-injury relief system can also play an important public health role in enhancing drug safety.",0,0,,Review
