A New Conceptual Framework for Academic Health Centers,"Borden, William B.; Mushlin, Alvin I.; Gordon, Jonathan E.; Leiman, Joan M.; Pardes, Herbert; LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS; Borden, William B.; Mushlin, Alvin I.; Gordon, Jonathan E.; Leiman, Joan M.; Pardes, Herbert; Borden, William B.",2015,ACADEMIC MEDICINE,10.1097/ACM.0000000000000688,WOS:000353879700014,USA,"Led by the Affordable Care Act, the U.S. health care system is undergoing a transformative shift toward greater accountability for quality and efficiency. Academic health centers (AHCs), whose triple mission of clinical care, research, and education serves a critical role in the country's health care system, must adapt to this evolving environment. Doing so successfully, however, requires a broader understanding of the wide-ranging roles of the AHC. This article proposes a conceptual framework through which the triple mission is expanded along four new dimensions: health, innovation, community, and policy. Examples within the conceptual framework categories, such as the AHCs' safety net function, their contributions to local economies, and their role in right-sizing the health care workforce, illustrate how each of these dimensions provides a more robust picture of the modern AHC and demonstrates the value added by AHCs. This conceptual framework also offers a basis for developing new performance metrics by which AHCs, both individually and as a group, can be held accountable, and that can inform policy decisions affecting them. This closer examination of the myriad activities of modern AHCs clarifies their essential role in our health care system and will enable these institutions to evolve, improve, be held accountable for, and more fully serve the health of the nation.",0,0,HOSPITAL TEACHING INTENSITY; MEDICAL-EDUCATION; CARE; INTERVENTION; IMPROVEMENT; INNOVATION; MORTALITY; COMMUNITY; IMPACT,Article

Lessons From Medicaid's Divergent Paths On Mental Health And Addiction Services,"Andrews, Christina; Grogan, Colleen M.; Brennan, Marianne; Pollack, Harold A.; PROJECT HOPE; Andrews, Christina; Grogan, Colleen M.; Brennan, Marianne; Pollack, Harold A.; Andrews, Christina; Andrews, Christina; Pollack, Harold",2015,HEALTH AFFAIRS,10.1377/hlthaff.2015.0151,WOS:000360942500013,USA,"Over the past fifty years Medicaid has taken divergent paths in financing mental health and addiction treatment. In mental health, Medicaid became the dominant source of funding and had a profound impact on the organization and delivery of services. But it played a much more modest role in addiction treatment. This is poised to change, as the Affordable Care Act is expected to dramatically expand Medicaid's role in financing addiction services. In this article we consider the different paths these two treatment systems have taken since 1965 and identify strategic lessons that the addiction treatment system might take from mental health's experience under Medicaid. These lessons include leveraging optional coverage categories to tailor Medicaid to the unique needs of the addiction treatment system, providing incentives to addiction treatment programs to create and deliver high-quality alternatives to inpatient treatment, and using targeted Medicaid licensure standards to increase the quality of addiction services.",0,0,SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; AFFORDABLE CARE ACT; TREATMENT PROGRAMS; UNITED-STATES; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; ABUSE TREATMENT; MAINTENANCE; INSURANCE,Article

Data Sources and Study Setting 2017 Oregon Medicaid claims from the Oregon Health Authority and electronic health records (EHR) from OCHIN, a clinical data research network, were used. Study Design We cross-sectionally assessed Hispanic-White, Black-White, and Asian-White disparities in 22 quality and utilization measures, comparing self-reported race and ethnicity to imputed values from the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) algorithm. Data Collection Race and ethnicity were obtained from self-reported data and imputed using BISG. Principal Findings 42.5%/4.9% of claims/EHR were missing self-reported data; BISG estimates were available for >99% of each and had good concordance (0.87-0.95) with Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White self-report. All estimated racial and ethnic disparities were statistically similar in self-reported and imputed EHR-based measures. However, within claims, BISG estimates and incomplete self-reported data yielded substantially different disparities in almost half of the measures, with BISG-based Black-White disparities generally larger than self-reported race and ethnicity data. Conclusions BISG imputation methods are feasible for Medicaid claims data and reduced missingness to <1%. Disparities may be larger than what is estimated using self-reported data with high rates of missingness.",0,0,Bayesian imputation; health care disparities; HEDIS; Medicaid; quality of health care; race factors; AFFORDABLE CARE ACT; INSURANCE-COVERAGE; HEALTH; ACCESS; RACE/ETHNICITY; IMPUTATION; IMPACT; RACE,Article

In this systematic review, 22 alternative payment and/or care-delivery models in cancer care were identified. These included 6 bundled payments, 4 accountable care organizations, 9 patient-centered medical homes, and 3 other interventions. Only 12 interventions reported outcomes; the majority (n = 7; 58%) improved value, 4 had no impact, and 1 reduced value, but only initially. Heterogeneity of outcomes precluded a meta-analysis.

Despite their potential benefits, however, ACOs also raise significant antitrust concerns concerns that may pit consumer surplus and total surplus against one another. In an attempt to address these concerns, the Department of Justice and Fair Trade Commission announced that they will use market share screens and rule of reason treatment to evaluate ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program. The use of market share screens and rule of reason treatment allows the antitrust agencies to avoid prioritizing either consumer surplus, or total surplus in the first instance but leaves open two critical questions: What will the rule of reason treatment afforded to ACOs look like? And how will the antitrust agencies ultimately determine whether ACOs benefit or harm consumers? In order to address these questions, this Note proposes that the antitrust agencies use the ""big data"" collected under the Affordable Care Act to conduct a structured rule of reason review of ACOs that takes into account both the consumer surplus and total surplus through a burden-shifting framework.",0,0,HEALTH-CARE; ANTITRUST; HOSPITALS; EFFICIENCY; WELFARE; MERGERS; PROFIT; REFORM; GOALS; LAW,Article

Factors Influencing Patient Experience in Pediatric Neurology,"Singh, Suprit C.; Sheth, Raj D.; Burrows, James F.; Rosen, Paul; ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC; Singh, Suprit C.; Sheth, Raj D.; Burrows, James F.; Rosen, Paul; Rosen, Paul; Rosen, Paul; Sheth, Raj D",2016,PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY,10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2016.04.002,WOS:000379889900005,USA,"INTRODUCTION: Hospitals have begun to shift toward patient-centered care because of the pay-for-performance system that was established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In pediatrics, the needs of both the caregiver and the pediatric patient have to be taken into account. Pediatric practices have been shifting toward a family-centered approach, although the primary drivers have not been well defined. Identifying the key patient experiences that lead to higher patient satisfaction would enable a more meaningful clinical encounter. To better understand patient experience, we examined waiting time and the elements of the physician patient interaction in pediatric neurology. We predict that the determining factor in patient satisfaction is the physician patient interaction. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Patient satisfaction surveys were sent to families via mail or e-mail after their ambulatory pediatric neurology visit. The visits took place between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014, at one of multiple locations in a children's health system spanning four states. A Likert scale was used for these surveys, and a top-box method (measuring percent of survey questions were rated 5 out of 5) was used to filter data from this database. Statistical analysis using a Pearson correlation was used for data analysis, with likelihood to recommend practice as the dependent variable. RESULTS: The five survey questions that correlated most with overall likelihood to recommend the practice were cheerfulness of practice (r = 0.79); staff working together (r = 0.76); cleanliness of practice (r = 0.70); wait time at clinic, from entering to leaving (r = 0.66); and likelihood of recommending care provider (r = 0.65). CONCLUSION: Pediatric neurologists striving to enhance overall patient satisfaction in their practices should work toward providing an atmosphere that supports office staff cheerfulness, teamwork, and visit efficiency provided in a clean and friendly environment.",0,0,patient experience; patient satisfaction; patient-physician interaction; family-centered care; QUALITY-OF-CARE; HEALTH-CARE; SATISFACTION; EDUCATION; TEAMWORK; SAFETY; US,Article

In 2008, Oregon held a lottery for restricted access to its Medicaid program for uninsured low-income adults not otherwise eligible for public coverage. The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment used this opportunity to conduct the first randomized controlled study of a public insurance expansion. This analysis builds off of previous work by comparing rural and urban survey outcomes and adds qualitative interviews with 86 rural study participants for context. We examine health care access and use, personal finances, and self-reported health. While urban and rural populations have unique demographic profiles, rural populations appear to have benefited from Medicaid as much as urban.
