A Mixed Methods Evaluation of a Pilot Multidisciplinary Breathlessness Support Service,"Drury, Amanda; Goss, Julie; Afolabi, Jide; McHugh, Gillian; O'Leary, Norma; Brady, Anne-Marie; SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC; Drury, Amanda; Drury, Amanda; Goss, Julie; Afolabi, Jide; McHugh, Gillian; O'Leary, Norma; Brady, Anne-Marie; Drury, Amanda; Drury, Amanda; Brady, Anne-Marie; Drury, Amanda; Drury, Amanda",2023,EVALUATION REVIEW,10.1177/0193841X231162402,WOS:000962653400001,Ireland,"Breathlessness support services have demonstrated benefits for breathlessness mastery, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes for people living with breathlessness. However, these services have predominantly been implemented in hospital and home care contexts. This study aims to evaluate the adaptation and implementation of a hospice-based outpatient Multidisciplinary Breathlessness Support Service (MBSS) in Ireland. A sequential explanatory mixed methods design guided this study. People with chronic breathlessness participated in longitudinal questionnaires (n = 10), medical record audit (n = 14) and a post-discharge interview (n = 8). Caregivers (n = 1) and healthcare professionals involved in referral to (n = 2) and delivery of (n = 3) the MBSS participated in a cross-sectional interview. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated deductively via the pillar integration process, guided by the RE-AIM framework. Integration of mixed methods data enhanced understanding of factors influencing the reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the MBSS, and the potential outcomes that were most meaningful for service users. Potential threats to the sustainability of the MBSS related to potential preconceptions of hospice care, the lack of standardized discharge pathways from the service and access to primary care services to sustain pharmacological interventions. This study suggests that an adapted multidisciplinary breathlessness support intervention is feasible and acceptable in a hospice context. However, to ensure optimal reach and maintenance of the intervention, activities are required to ensure that misconceptions about the setting do not influence willingness to accept referral to MBSS services and integration of services is needed to enable consistency in referral and discharge processes.",0,0,dyspnea; integration; joint displays; mixed methods; pillar integration process; palliative care; OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PALLIATIVE CARE; SELF-EFFICACY; REFRACTORY BREATHLESSNESS; COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; DOCTORS ATTITUDES; SYMPTOM CLUSTER; CANCER PATIENTS; LUNG-CANCER,Article

Quality improvement studies are needed to assess the representativeness of PRO data collected in routine care, identify the underlying causes of non-response and develop novel methods to ensure data representativeness. Using a multilevel framework and a mixed-methods approach, we have three aims: (1) characterise the non-response of the Global-10 across clinic, provider and patient levels; (2) identify multilevel causes of non-response and potential strategies to improve representativeness in PRO collection; and (3) develop effective modifications to missing-data methods to enhance the representativeness of pre-existing PRO data. Methods and analysis Our primary data source is the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global-10, collected as part of routine care at the Radiation Oncology clinics within the Mass General Brigham (MGB) healthcare system. Other sources include (1) Harvard Catalyst for provider-specific data, (2) MGB administrative data, (3) public Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data and (4) the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System. We will conduct quantitative analyses to assess variations in Global-10 non-response across multilevel factors. Additionally, we will use qualitative interviews with patients and clinical professionals to understand the causes of non-response and to formulate strategies to expand the reach of PRO collection to underrepresented cancer patients, improve their completions and enhance overall data representativeness. Finally, we will integrate implementation science knowledge and findings from the first two aims into missing-data methods to manage non-response in the pre-existing Global-10 data and to evaluate their performance in preserving representativeness. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (24-225). Written informed consent will be obtained from participants. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international conferences.",0,0,CLINICAL-TRIALS; CANCER; IMPUTATION,Article

Methods: We surveyed 12 public hospitals from which inpatients were randomly selected using hospitalization ID and outpatients were selected using census sampling to participate in the interview. Trust in physicians was measured using the Chinese version of Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale. Mixed-effects and logistic models were employed to study correlates of trust. Results: The distribution of scale mean was left skewed, which implied a subpopulation bearing low levels of trust towards physicians. Respondents who were male, young, outpatients, unsatisfied with their life status, had high levels of education and income, and paid less attention to their health were prone to be less satisfied with their physicians. Conclusions: The level of physician trust in China is lower compared to studies in western countries. We also found demographic factors related with significantly lower physician trust, which may help policymakers identify potential target subpopulations and be more specific with their efforts to improve patient-physician relationships.",0,0,patient-physician trust; Wake Forest Physician Trust Scale; correlates; China; mixed-effects model; HEALTH-CARE; PROVIDERS; SERVICES; QUALITY; SCALE,Article

Objectives: This research aimed to investigate the current situation regarding palliative care and the important factors that influence its utilization by inpatients (including inpatients with and without cancer) at the end of their lives. We also explored the feasibility of establishing a prediction model of palliative care utilization for inpatients at the end of their lives. These findings will allow medical staff to monitor and focus on those who may require palliative care, resulting in more end-of-life patients receiving palliative care and thereby reducing medical expense and improving their quality of life. Methods: This was a retrospective study based on real-world health information system (HIS) data from 5 different branches of Taipei City Hospital between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018 that enrolled a total of 1668 deceased inpatients. To explore palliative care utilization at the end of life, we used 5-fold cross-validation in four different statistical models to obtain the performance of predictive accuracy: logistic regression (LGR), classification and regression tree (CART), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), and gradient boosting (GB). The important variables that may affect palliative care utilization by inpatients were also identified. Results: The results were as follows: (1) 497 (29.8%) inpatients received palliative care; (2) the average daily hospitalization cost of patients with cancer who received palliative care (NTD 5789 vs. NTD 12,115; p <= 0.001) and all patients who received palliative care (NTD 91,527 vs. NTD 186,981; p = 0.0037) were statistically significantly lower than patients who did not receive palliative care; (3) diagnosis, hospital, and length of stay (LOS) may affect palliative care utilization of inpatient; diagnosis, hospitalization unit, and length of hospitalization were statistically significant by LGR; (4) 51.5% of patients utilized palliative consultation services, and 48.5% utilized palliative care units; and (5) MARS had the most consistent results; its accuracy was 0.751, and the main predictors of palliative care utilization are hospital, medical expense, LOS, diagnosis, and Palliative Care Screening Tool-Taiwan version (TW-PCST) scores. Conclusions: The results reveal that palliative care utilization by inpatients remains low, and it is necessary to educate patients without cancer of the benefits and advantages of palliative care. Although data were limited, the predictability of the MARS model was 0.751; a better prediction model with more data is necessary for further research. Precisely predicting the need for palliative care may encourage patients and their family members to consider palliative care, which may balance both physical and mental care. Therefore, unnecessary medical care can be avoided and limited medical resources can be allocated to more patients in need.",0,0,palliative care utilization; machine learning methods; ADVANCED CANCER; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; CONSULTATION; COST; INTERVENTION; HOSPICE; COHORT; TEAMS; UNIT,Article

Materials and methods: The economic model was developed from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS) and used a decision-tree approach to reflect real-world treatment of patients with invasive fungal infection (IFI) prior to differential pathogen diagnosis. It was assumed that 7.8% of patients with IFI prior to differential pathogen diagnosis at treatment initiation actually had mucormycosis, and confirmation of pathogen identification was achieved for 50% of all patients during treatment. To extrapolate to a lifetime horizon, the model considered expected survival based on the patients' underlying condition. The model estimated the incremental costs (costs of drugs, laboratory analysis, hospitalization, and management of adverse events) and clinical outcomes (life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) of first-line treatment with isavuconazole compared with voriconazole. The robustness of the results was assessed by conducting deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Isavuconazole delivered 0.48 more LYs and 0.39 more QALYs per patient at an incremental cost of 3,228 pound, compared with voriconazole in the treatment of patients with IFI prior to differential pathogen diagnosis. This equates to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 8,242 pound per additional QALY gained and 6,759 pound per LY gained. These results were driven by a lack of efficacy of voriconazole in mucormycosis. Results were most sensitive to the mortality of IA patients and treatment durations. Conclusions: At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 30,000 pound per additional QALY, the use of isavuconazole for the treatment of patients with IFI prior to differential pathogen diagnosis in the UK can be considered a cost-effective allocation of healthcare resources compared with voriconazole.",0,0,Invasive aspergillosis; isavuconazole; mucormycosis; cost-effectiveness; economic; healthcare; LIPOSOMAL AMPHOTERICIN-B; SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES MORTALITY; IN-VITRO; VORICONAZOLE; ASPERGILLOSIS; GUIDELINES; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MUCORMYCOSIS; POSACONAZOLE; CASPOFUNGIN,Article

Patient demographics, average lengths of stay and legal frameworks also differ substantially. The lack of basic epidemiological information on forensic patients and of shared indicators on forensic care within Europe is an obstacle to comparative research. The reasons for such variation are not well understood. Methods Experts from seventeen EU states submitted data on forensic bed prevalence rates, gender distributions and average length of stay in forensic in-patient facilities. Average length of stay and bed prevalence rates were examined for associations with country-level variables including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), expenditure on healthcare, prison population, general psychiatric bed prevalence rates and democracy index scores. Results The data demonstrated substantial differences between states. Average length of stay was approximately ten times greater in the Netherlands than Slovenia. In England and Wales, 18% of patients were female compared to 5% in Slovenia. There was a 17-fold difference in forensic bed rates per 100,000 between the Netherlands and Spain. Exploratory analyses suggested average length of stay was associated with GDP, expenditure on healthcare and democracy index scores. Conclusion The data presented in this study represent the most recent overview of key epidemiological data in forensic services across seventeen EU states. However, systematically collected epidemiological data of good quality remain elusive in forensic psychiatry. States need to develop common definitions and recording practices and contribute to a publicly available database of such epidemiological indicators.",0,0,Forensic mental health; Prevalence; Beds; Deinstitutionalization; Europe; ADMISSION; SERVICES; CARE; ILL,Article

This was a qualitative observational study utilizing open-ended, semistructured interviews of 39 people with diabetes who were purposively selected because they had either a foot ulcer (n=19) or a lower extremity amputation (n=20). Interviews were audio-recorded, deidentified, and entered into NVivo 10.0 for coding and analysis. Our integrated analytic approach combined inductively and deductively derived codes that were applied to all transcripts. Coded data were summarized and examined for patterns. Participants' description of the relationship between diabetes and their foot ulcer or amputation revealed a limited understanding of the disease process. Disruption and loss of independence was expressed whether the person had a foot ulcer or an amputation. Treatment recommendations for foot ulcers were viewed by most as extremely difficult. Amputation was a feared outcome, but some learned to adapt and, at times felt that the amputation enhanced their quality of life. Clinicians have assumed that a focus on limb salvage is preferred over a major amputation. However, because of the complexity of care requiring frequent healthcare provider visits, the frequency of care failure, the frequency of recurrence, and mortality associated with having had a foot ulcer, it may be more appropriate for clinicians to prioritize quality-of-life salvage. Foot ulcer treatment failure may be due to a lack of providers' understanding of the impact of treatment on a patient's life.",0,0,HEALTH-SERVICES RESEARCH; FOOT ULCERS; EXPLANATORY MODELS; OUTCOMES RESEARCH; MIXED METHODS; MANAGEMENT; INTERVENTIONS; ULCERATION; LITERACY; BELIEFS,Article

This study was a quality improvement project that utilized a randomized, controlled, crossover study design to compare two different educational techniques for medication infusion administration. We hypothesized that the use of a metronome-based technique would decrease medication dosage errors and reduce time to administration for intravenous medication infusions. Methods Forty-two nationally registered paramedics were randomized to either a metronome-based technique versus a standard stopwatch-based technique. Each subject served as a control. Subjects were asked to establish an infusion of amiodarone at a dose of 150 mg administered over 10 min, simulating treatment of a hemodynamically stable patient with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Descriptive statistics and a repeated measures mixed linear regression model were used for data analysis. Results When compared to a standard stopwatch-based technique, a metronome-based technique was associated with faster time to goal (median 34 s [IQR, 22-54] vs 50 s; [IQR 38-61 s], P = 0.006) and fewer mid-infusion adjustments. Ease of use was reported to be significantly higher for the metronome group (median ranking 5, IQR 4-5) compared to the standard group (median ranking 2, IQR 2-3; P < 0.001). Conclusions Knowledge regarding a metronome technique may help EMS clinicians provide safe and effective IV infusions. Such a technique may be beneficial for learners and educators alike.",0,0,Prehospital; Emergency medical services; Medication infusion; Medical calculation; Medication dosing; Resuscitation; ACCURACY,Article

Existing literature found that occupational stressors and low levels of job satisfaction were related to burnout, whilst personality traits such as type A personality and neuroticism influenced occupational stressors, job satisfaction, and burnout. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating effect of job satisfaction on the relationship between occupational stressors and burnout among Chinese older nurses, and explore the moderating effects of type A personality and neuroticism on the relationships among occupational stressors, job satisfaction and burnout. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in five provinces and municipalities (mainly in Shandong) in China. A total of 527 female older nurses (age >= 40) were included in this study. Structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was employed to investigate the mediating effect of job satisfaction on the relationship between occupational stressors and burnout. Multi-group analysis was conducted to explore the moderating effects of type A personality and neuroticism on the relationships among occupational stressors, job satisfaction and burnout. Results Both nurses with high type A personality and high neuroticism had higher occupational stressors, higher burnout and lower job satisfaction. Occupational stressors had direct effect (beta = 0.29, P = 0.001) and indirect effect mediated by low levels of job satisfaction (beta = 0.25, P = 0.001) on burnout. Type A personality had significant moderated effect (P = 0.007) on the relationships among occupational stressors, job satisfaction and burnout, whereas the moderated effect of neuroticism was not significant. Conclusions Low levels of job satisfaction mediated the relationship between occupational stressors and burnout among Chinese older nurses, and both the direct and indirect effect of occupational stressors on burnout were moderated by type A personality. Hospital administrators should take specific measures such as transferring older nurses to easier positions to reduce their occupational stress, thereby increasing their job satisfaction and reducing their burnout, which is especially important for the older nurses with high type A personality.",0,0,Burnout; Job satisfaction; Neuroticism; Nurses; Occupational stress; Type A personality; WORK-ENVIRONMENT; PATIENT-CARE; HEALTH; BEHAVIOR; QUALITY; ERROR,Article

Co-creation is a suitable approach for developing and implementing digital technologies and transforming the service accordingly. This study aimed to identify the facilitators and barriers for implementation of digital monitoring technology in residential care for persons with dementia and wandering behaviour, and explore co-creation as an implementation strategy and practice.MethodsIn this longitudinal case study, we observed and elicited the experiences of care providers and healthcare managers in eight nursing homes, in addition to those of the information technology (IT) support services and technology vendors, during a four-year implementation process. We were guided by theories on innovation, implementation and learning, as well as co-creation and design. The data were analysed deductively using a determinants of innovation framework, followed by an inductive content analysis of interview and observation data.ResultsThe implementation represented radical innovation and required far more resources than the incremental changes anticipated by the participants. Five categories of facilitators and barriers were identified, including several subcategories for each category: 1) Pre-implementation preparations; 2) Implementation strategy; 3) Technology stability and usability; 4) Building competence and organisational learning; and 5) Service transformation and quality management. The combination of IT infrastructure instability and the reluctance of the IT support service to contribute in co-creating value with the healthcare services was the most persistent barrier. Overall, the co-creation methodology was the most prominent facilitator, resulting in a safer night monitoring service.ConclusionSuccessful implementation of novel digital monitoring technologies in the care service is a complex and time-consuming process and even more so when the technology allows care providers to radically transform clinical practices at the point of care, which offers new affordances in the co-creation of value with their residents. From a long-term perspective, the digital transformation of municipal healthcare services requires more advanced IT competence to be integrated directly into the management and provision of healthcare and value co-creation with service users and their relatives.",13,0,Service design; Absorptive capacity; Risk; Triple helix; Workflow; Radical innovation; INTELLIGENT ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY; SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY; INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES; ABSORPTIVE-CAPACITY; SERVICE INNOVATION; PEOPLE; NURSES; SAFETY; ORGANIZATIONS; DETERMINANTS,Article

However, the concept has been criticised for being poorly theorised and operationalised. Serious illness is especially aligned with the need for person-centredness, usually necessitating involvement of significant others, management of clinical uncertainty, high-quality communication and joint decision-making to deliver care concordant with patient preferences. This review aimed to identify and appraise the empirical evidence underpinning conceptualisations of 'person-centredness' for serious illness. Methods Search strategy conducted in May 2020. Databases: CINAHL, Embase, PubMed, Ovid Global Health, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. Free text search terms related to (1) person-centredness, (2) serious illness and (3) concept/practice. Tabulation, textual description and narrative synthesis were performed, and quality appraisal conducted using QualSyst tools. Santana et al's person-centred care model (2018) was used to structure analysis. Results PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) flow data: n=12,446 studies screened by title/abstract, n=144 full articles assessed for eligibility, n=18 studies retained. All studies (n=18) are from high-income countries, and are largely of high quality (median score 0.82). The findings suggest that person-centred care encompasses the patient and family being respected, given complete information, involved in decision-making and supported in their physical, psychological, social and existential needs. The studies highlight the importance of involving and supporting family/friends, promoting continuation of normality and self-identity, and structuring service organisation to enable care continuity. Conclusion Person-centred healthcare must value the social network of patients, promote quality of life and reform structurally to improve patients' experience interacting with the healthcare system. Staff must be supported to flexibly adapt skills, communication, routines or environments for individual patients. There remains a need for primary data investigating the meaning and practice of PCC in a greater diversity of diagnostic groups and settings, and a need to ground potential components of PCC within broader universal values and ethical theory.",11,0,systematic review; health services research; health systems; health policy; INTEGRATIVE CANCER CARE; PATIENT; HEALTH; SELF; MANAGEMENT; MEDICINE; STAFF,Review

"""You have to make a judgment call"". - Morals, judgments and the provision of quality sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents in South Africa","Mueller, Alexandra; Roehrs, Stefanie; Hoffman-Wanderer, Yonina; Moult, Kelley; PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD; Mueller, Alexandra; Roehrs, Stefanie; Hoffman-Wanderer, Yonina; Moult, Kelley; Mueller, Alexandra; Moult, Kelley; Muller, Alex; Muller, Alexandra",2016,SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE,10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.11.048,WOS:000368958700010,South Africa,"South Africa's legal framework on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) care for teenagers is complex. On the one hand, the law protects their right to make decisions regarding reproduction e.g. giving girls of any age the right to terminate a pregnancy, and allowing adolescents to consent to receive contraception from age 12. On the other hand, the Sexual Offences Act sets the age of consent to sex at 16 years, and requires mandatory reporting of anyone younger. These contradictory obligations mean that nurses, doctors and counsellors are expected to provide care, and counsel teenagers about their choices, but also report and enforce the law. They must therefore make judgments about inherently moral issues: should teenagers be having sex, and what services should they receive? Based on in-depth interviews at 28 healthcare facilities conducted in 2012, and data from workshops on the 'conflicting laws' held in 2014, the paper uses the theoretical framework of street-level bureaucracy to understand barriers to nurses providing SRH care for teenagers in South Africa, and the implication that this has for adolescents' SRH. The paper argues that nurses' adaptation of the law is a response to significant structural constraints, moral discomfort, and poor understanding of the law all taken against an ethical framework that emphasizes quality, responsive patient care. The result is uneven implementation that undermines SRH information, access to services, and ultimately increases risks for teens. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the underlying mechanisms that stimulate nurses' career self-management are unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the mediating effect of self-efficacy and the moderating effect of proactive personality on the relationship between perceived organisational support and career self-management among nurses. Design This was a cross-sectional survey. Setting and participants A total of 1866 nurses from 15 hospitals across 15 cities in China were recruited for this study. Primary and secondary outcome measures The Perceived Organizational Support Scale, General Self-efficacy Scale, Proactive Personality Scale and Individual Career Management Questionnaire were used. Data were analysed using moderated mediation regressions with Hayes' PROCESS macro in SPSS version 26.0. Results General self-efficacy mediated the relationship between perceived organisational support and career self-management. Proactive personality moderated the direct (B=0.043, p<0.001, 95% CI 0.026 to 0.060) and indirect relationship (B=0.098, p<0.001, 95% CI 0.074 to 0.123) between perceived organisational support and career self-management. Further, the positive effects of perceived organisational support on general self-efficacy and career self-management were stronger for nurses with a high level of proactive personality. The model explained 47.2% of the variance in career self-management.

The majority of acute pain episodes are managed at home without the need to access health care. The long-term consequences of poorly treated acute pain include chronic pain, adverse effects of chronic opioid usage, psychological maladjustment, poor quality ofl life, and excessive health care utilization. There is no standard protocol for management of an acute pain crisis in either the hospital or the community. The assumptions that severe acute pain must be managed in the hospital with parenteral opioids and that strong opioids are needed for home management of pain need to be questioned. Pain management in the emergency department often does not meet acceptable standards, while chronic use of strong opioids is likely to result in opioid-induced hyperalgesia, exacerbation of chronic pain symptoms, and opioid de pendency. We suggest that an integrated approach is needed to control the underlying condition, modify psychological responses, optimize social support, and ensure that health care services provide safe, effective, and prompt treatment of acute pain and appropriate management of chronic pain.

However, at present, the performance-oriented management system of medical institutions, imbalanced allocation of medical resources, and other problems are likely to cause unethical pro-organisational behaviour (UPB) among medical staff. Objective: To explore the causes of pro-organizational unethical behaviors among health care workers from the perspective of employee-organizational relationships and to investigate the mechanism of organizational support perception on pro-organizational unethical behaviors. Methods: A multi-stage sampling method was used to assess 322 health care workers from several tertiary and above public hospitals in China, using the Sense of Organizational Support Scale, the Organizational Identity Scale and the Pro-Organizational Unethical behaviors. Results: All dimensions of perceived organisational support (job support, concerns about employee interests, and value identification) significantly positively predicted organisational identification and UPB (p < 0.05). Organisational identification significantly positively predicted UPB (p < 0.05), and partially mediated the relationship between all three dimensions of perceived organisational support and Conclusion: Medical institutions in China could positively guide medical staff through professional training to effectively avoid their UPB. Digital technologies, such as internet platforms, can also be used to increase job support for medical staff from outside the organisation. The recognition of the contributions of medical staff could be strengthened to enhance their sense of social identity and social responsibility, which may help effectively reduce their UPB.",0,0,medical staff; unethical pro-organisational behaviour; perceived organisational support; organisational identification; value identification; EMPLOYEES; MODEL; BAD,Article

Drawing on the dynamic capability view, this study aims at exploring the relationship among supply chain dynamic capabilities (SCDCs), supply chain integration (SCI), supply chain resilience (SCR), sustainable competitive advantage (SCA), and sustainable supply chain performance (SSCP). The study collected 325 usable responses from healthcare supply chain organizations in the developing country of Pakistan, including hospitals, pharmaceutical manufacturing firms, surgical and equipment manufacturing firms, etc. Structural equation modeling using Smart-PLS v.3.3.2 was adopted for the data analysis. The results indicate that SCDCs positively influence SCI, SCR, SCA, and SSCP. This study finds that SCA, SCI, and SCR mediate the relationship between SCDCs and SSCP. This study contributes by aligning the SC dynamic capabilities for supply chain visibilities (i.e., sensing, learning, and coordinating) in the healthcare context. It has examined the impacts of SCDC, SCI, and SCR collectively rather than addressing them piecemeal. Sensing, learning, and coordinating capabilities through frequent collaborative meetings offer healthcare firms SC integration, allowing them to respond to the changing environment quickly and resiliently, further improving their SCA and SSCP. Since disruptions are inevitable, healthcare organizations must turn uncertainties into opportunities and activate a dynamic and resilient strategy to absorb stress.

Methods A scoping review was conducted and studies that reported using CQI approaches to improve existing oral health services or quality of care deemed relevant to Aboriginal Australian communities were included. Results A total of 73 articles were retrieved and eight articles were included in the final synthesis. Several CQI tools were identified, including: plan-do-study-act cycles, dental quality alliance measures, prioritisation matrices, causal mapping and the use of collective impact methodology. Conclusion Data exploring CQI in the context of Aboriginal oral health is scarce. The plan-do-study-act cycle and its variations show potential applicability to Aboriginal oral health care.

Guided exercise and mindfulness-based stress management (MBSM) programs have shown promise, mainly in the inpatient setting. We aimed to examine the feasibility of a virtual, home-based, combined exercise and MBSM program. Methods Patients attending post-HCT clinic were invited to participate in this single-arm pre-post study. Eligibility criteria included age 18-75 years, > 6 months post allogeneic HCT. Consented participants attended an in-person session, followed by weekly exercise and MBSM training for 6 weeks via videoconferencing. Assessments were performed pre-training, and at 3-, 6- and 12-months and compared using a linear mixed effects model. Results 21 of 24 patients consenting to the study completed the program (median age 56 years [IQR 46-62], median time post-HCT 37 months [IQR 26-46]). Six-minute walk test scores were significantly higher at 3 (mean difference 79.6, 95%CI 28-131, ES 0.55) and 12 months (mean difference 48.4, 95%CI 13-84, ES 0.33) compared to baseline.

Data sources We identified beneficiaries of age 65 years or older undergoing hip or knee joint replacement in the 100% sample of Medicare fee-for-service inpatient (Part A) claims from January 1, 2013 to August 31, 2017. Cases were linked to subsequent outpatient, Part B, home health agency, and skilled nursing facility claims, as well as publicly available participation status for CJR. Study design We estimated the effect of CJR for hospitals in the 67 metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) selected to participate in CJR (785 hospitals), compared to those in 104 non-CJR MSAs (962 hospitals; maintaining fee-for-service). A difference-in-differences approach was used to detect patient selection, as well as to compare 90-day episode-of-care costs and quality of care between CJR and non-CJR hospitals over the first two performance years. Data collection We excluded 172 hospitals from our analysis due to their preexisting BPCI participation. We focused on elective admissions in the main analysis. Principal findings While reductions in 90-day episode-of-care costs were greater among CJR hospitals (-$902, 95% CI: -$1305, -$499), largely driven by a 16.8% (p < 0.01) decline in 90-day spending in skilled nursing facilities, CJR hospitals significantly reduced the 90-day readmission rate (-3.9%; p < 0.05) and preferentially avoided patients aged 85 years or older (-5.9%; p < 0.01) and Black (-7.0%; p < 0.01).

Translating as response to paradoxes - when implementing HRM strategies in service organisations,"Sandoff, Mette; Widell, Gill; RAINER HAMPP VERLAG; Sandoff, Mette; Widell, Gill; Sandoff, Mette",2015,ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PERSONALFORSCHUNG,10.1688/ZfP-2015-03-Sandoff,WOS:000371093700007,Sweden,"The purpose of this article is on the one hand to investigate paradoxes caused by the collision between rationalities of top management HRM strategies and local ones at the level of line managers, and on the other, the responses to them. A grounded-theory approach is used on empirical material from a university hospital and a dozen of high quality hotels. The study has shown that hospital HR staff and hotel directors respond to paradoxes by translating. A conclusion is that when repeatedly having to cope with these paradoxes, a special skill is developed, the skill of translating top-down strategic decisions into alternatives that fit different local conditions. The paradoxes, which the line managers responsible at the local level could otherwise not handle, are thus manageable thanks to consciously developed translating skills by hospital HR staff and hotel directors. These translations work as stimuli to strategy implementation when there is trust between translators and those who must execute the strategies, i.e. the line managers.",0,0,HRM; responding to paradoxes; trustful translating; rationalities of top management; strategy implementation; LOGICS; TRUST; MODEL,Article

High-need, high-cost (HNHC) alcohol-related frequent attenders (ARFA) are a relatively small subgroup of patients, having multiple admissions or attendances from alcohol during a short time period. This trial aims to test the effectiveness of an assertive outreach treatment (AOT) approach in improving clinical outcomes for ARFA, and reducing resource use in the acute setting.MethodsOne hundred and sixty ARFA patients will be recruited and following baseline assessment, randomly assigned to AOT plus care as usual (CAU) or CAU alone in equal numbers. Baseline assessment includes alcohol consumption and related problems, physical and mental health comorbidity and health and social care service use in the previous 6 months using standard validated tools, plus a measure of resource use. Follow-up assessments at 6 and 12months after randomization includes the same tools as baseline plus standard measure of patient satisfaction. Outcomes for CAU+AOT and CAU at 6 and 12months will be compared, controlling for pre-specified baseline measures. Primary outcome will be percentage of days abstinent at 12months. Secondary outcomes include emergency department (ED) attendance, number and length of hospital admissions, alcohol consumption, alcohol-related problems, other health service use, mental and physical comorbidity 6 and 12months post intervention. Health economic analysis will estimate the economic impact of AOT from health, social care and societal perspectives and explore cost-effectiveness in terms of quality adjusted life years and alcohol consumption at 12-month follow-up.DiscussionAOT models piloted with alcohol dependent patients have demonstrated significant reductions in alcohol consumption and use of unplanned National Health Service (NHS) care, with increased engagement with alcohol treatment services, compared with patients receiving CAU. While AOT interventions are costlier per case than current standard care in the UK, the rationale for targeting HNHC ARFAs is because of their disproportionate contribution to overall alcohol burden on the NHS. No previous studies have evaluated the clinical and cost-effectiveness of AOT for HNHC ARFAs: this randomized controlled trial (RCT) targeting ARFAs across five South London NHS Trusts is the first.Trial registrationInternational standard randomized controlled trial number (ISRCTN) registry: ISRCTN67000214, retrospectively registered 26/11/2016.",0,0,Alcohol; Dependence; Frequent attenders; Assertive outreach treatment; Randomized controlled trial; Multimorbidity; High need high cost; GLOBAL BURDEN; DEPENDENCE; DISEASE; RELIABILITY; ACCIDENT; REASONS; PEOPLE; INJURY,Article

Among them, attention has been given to guiding patients towards high-volume hospitals that perform better, acccording to the volume-outcome association. This paper analyses which factors drive patients to choose big or small hospitals (with respect to the international standards of volumes of activity).MethodsWe examined colon cancer surgeries performed in Piedmont (Italy) between 2004 and 2018. We categorised the patient choice of the hospital as big/small, and we used this outcome as main dependent variable of descriptive statistics, tests and logistic regression models. As independent variables, we included (i) patient characteristics, (ii) characteristics of the closest big hospital (which should be perceived as the most immediate to be chosen), and (iii) territorial characteristics (i.e., characteristics of the set of hospitals among which the patient can choose). We also considered interactions among variables to examine which factors influence all or a subset of patients.ResultsOur results confirm that patient personal characteristics (such as age) and hospital characteristics (such as distance) play a primary role in the patient decision process. The findings seem to support the importance of closing small hospitals when they are close to big hospitals, although differences emerge between rural and urban areas. Other interesting insights are provided by examining the interactions between factors, e.g., patients affected by comorbidities are more responsive to hospital quality even though they are distant.ConclusionsReorganising healthcare services to concentrate them in high-volume hospitals emerged as a crucial issue more than forty years ago. Evidence suggests that concentration strategies guarantee better clinical performance. However, in healthcare systems in which patients are free to choose where to be treated, understanding patients' behaviour and what drives them towards the most effective choice is of paramount importance. Our study builds on previous research that has already analysed factors influencing patients' choices, and takes a step further to enlighten which factors drive patients to choose between a small or a big hospital (in terms of volume). The results could be used by decision makers to design the best concentration strategy.",0,0,Patients; Volume-outcome association; Volume of activity; Colon Cancer; Regional hospital planning; Choice; Logistic regression; HEALTH-CARE; CHOICE; OPERATIONS; MORTALITY; LOCATION; BEHAVIOR; SURGERY; QUALITY,Article
Integrating Fall Prevention Strategies into EMS Services to Reduce Falls and Associated Healthcare Costs for Older Adults,"Camp, Kathlene; Murphy, Sara; Pate, Brandon; DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD; Camp, Kathlene; Murphy, Sara; Pate, Brandon; Camp, Kathlene; Camp, Kathlene; Camp, Kathlene",2024,CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS IN AGING,10.2147/CIA.S453961,WOS:001189373800001,USA,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to detail the implementation of fall prevention initiatives through emergency medical services (EMS) and associated outcomes. Methods: Paramedics with MedStar Mobile Healthcare utilized the Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) fall prevention model to screen and direct intervention through 9-1-1 emergency response, High Utilization Group (HUG), and 30-day Hospital Readmission Avoidance (HRA) programs. Outcomes from 9-1-1 calls measured the number of older adults screened for falls and identified risk factors. The HUG and HRA programs measured change in quality of life with EuroQol-5D, referral service utilization, falls, emergent healthcare utilization, and hospital readmission data. Analysis included costs associated with reduced healthcare usage. Results: Emergency paramedics provided fall risk screening for 50.5% (n=45,090) of adults aged 65 and older and 59.3% were at risk of falls, with 48.1% taking medications known to increase the risk of falls. Services provided through the HUG and HRA programs, along with additional needed referral services, resulted in a 37.2% reduction in fall-related 9-1-1 calls and a 29.5% increase in overall health status related to quality of life. Analysis of the HUG program revealed potential savings of over $1 million with a per-patient enrolled savings of $19,053. The HRA program demonstrated a 16.4% hospital readmission rate, in comparison to a regional average of 30.2%, and a cost-savings of $4.95 million or $15,618 per enrolled patient. Conclusion: Implementation of the STEADI model into EMS services provides an effective and cost-saving model for addressing fall prevention for older adults, provides meaningful and impactful improvement for older adults, and could serve as a model for other EMS programs.",1,0,fall prevention; emergency providers; Mobile Integrated Healthcare; paramedics; age-friendly; NONFATAL FALLS; INJURIES,Article

Data were deductively and inductively coded by stakeholder type and the range of benefits, and the findings were informed by insights from a project reference group and a stakeholder advisory group. Questions explored the benefits of the RVTS - a program which supports doctors already working in rural, remote and First Nations communities to train towards general practice or rural generalist fellowship while remaining in the same practice.Main outcomes measuresPerspectives on the nature and spread of benefits.ResultsBroad benefits were perceived to flow to four system-level stakeholders: communities, health services, participants and policy makers. Perceived participant and community benefits were doctors staying longer in distributed locations with tailored place-based supports and training, doctors building relationships with patients, and doctors learning through longitudinal care. Health service benefits included reduced reliance on locums, improved continuity of accessible and appropriate services in areas otherwise facing major recruitment and retention issues, and the doctors having more time to contribute to improving service quality and upskilling local staff. Policy-maker benefits were sustaining safe and high quality services for distributed populations with high needs.ConclusionThe RVTS model was perceived to offer diverse benefits for different system stakeholders which could improve quality of learning, service delivery and community care. It also aligned with key policy directions for a distributed and sustainable generalist workforce under the goals of the National Medical Workforce Strategy 2021-2031 and the directions set by the independent review of overseas health practitioner regulatory settings led by Robyn Kruk.

Little is known about its use across European penal institutions. Our study aimed to assess the state of telemedicine within the European jails. Methods: To maximize data availability, we used two different approaches. A bottom-up approach was used by gathering information directly from prison directors of every single penal establishment of the 28 European members. A top-down approach was used to collect information from persons involved in prison administration or project leaders at national level. In both approaches questions were sent by mail. Results: Information gathered directly by contacting prison directors and/or persons in charge come from all the 28 EU members. In total, we contacted 211 prison directors and 116 persons in charge, with a total response rate of 67%. We have found that telemedicine, as additional healthcare delivery model, is used only in 11 countries, especially among members of Northern and Western Europe. Only Romania showed to have a pilot project for a nationwide program of telemedicine. Conclusions: Telemedicine services among European penitentiaries appear still poorly developed.

Balancing the PCB assembly line is crucial for improving productivity to meet market demand, which means balancing the workload distributed among various assembly stations on the assembly line. However, the workload balancing depends on materialhandling systems in production environments that facilitate the transportation of raw materials to the buffer storage of the assembly stations. In the PCB assembly system, the material handling is carried out using automated guided vehicles (AGVs). This paper studies the assembly line balancing and AGV scheduling collectively because of their dependency on each other. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to balance the workload distribution among stations and schedule the AGVs. An existing intelligent platform of the real-life PCB industry is considered to solve this integrated problem with intelligent decisions. The platform includes three layers modules: physical layer, data management layer and application service layer. A novel genetic artificial bee colony (GABC) algorithm is proposed and embedded with an application service layer to optimize the current problem and give optimum solutions for the real-life physical layer. The proposed GABC algorithm incorporates the operators of the genetic algorithm (GA) i.e., crossover and mutation into the search process of the ABC algorithm. Additionally, the greedy selection feature is employed in GABC which significantly enhances the exploitation capabilities, leading to faster convergence, higher-quality solutions, and improved robustness. The performance of the proposed GABC algorithm is tested based on different parameters by comparing the results with GA, ABC and PSO algorithms. Experimental analysis indicates that the proposed GABC algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms. Therefore, the yielded solutions in terms of prompt responses help managers to expedite the production through intelligent decision-making based on customer demands.",0,0,Assembly line balancing; AGV scheduling; Workload; Smart decision-making; Artificial bee colony algorithm,Article

Evidence for the effectiveness of the SUSD service model is limited but growing. Accordingly, this study looked to add to the extant body of knowledge, by (i) assessing change outcomes in mental health and wellbeing, and predictors of these changes, for patients who accessed Western Australia's first SUSD service; and (ii) evaluating patients' satisfaction with service, and what patients value from their stay.MethodsThis was a mixed-method retrospective cohort study. Participants comprised 382 patients who accessed a 22-bed Mental Health SUSD facility and incurred 551 episodes of care during the 01/07/2014-30/06/2016 period. Patients' change outcomes in psychological distress, general self-efficacy, and work and social adjustment from service entry to service exit were analyzed using generalized linear modeling. Simple Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated for preliminary assessment of the associations between patients' service satisfaction and their change outcomes. Qualitative outcomes that patients valued from their stay were analyzed thematically according to a semi-grounded theoretical approach.ResultsSignificant improvements were observed in patients' self-reported psychological distress, self-efficacy, and work and social adjustment (all p<0.0001). A strong and persistent baseline effect existed across the three measures. Older age, female gender, and having a dependent child in the same household were protective/enhancing factors for the patients' recovery. Satisfaction with service was high. Patients valued having the time and space to recuperate, gain insight, focus, and create changes in their lives.ConclusionThe encouraging findings, regarding both patients' change outcomes and satisfaction with service, support the value of the SUSD service model for patients with mental illnesses. Strengths and limitations were discussed; ensued recommendations were offered to both service providers and researchers to enhance the robustness of future research findings, to help inform more effective policy and funding decisions related to mental health care.",0,0,Community based mental health service; Sub-acute; Step-up step-down; Recovery; Prevention; Outcome measures; Patient satisfaction; Evaluation; OUTCOME MEASURES; RECOVERY; QUALITY; TRENDS,Article

Not surprisingly, the aging problem in the world is getting more intense, resulting in the increasing demand for higher-quality and well-organized medical and elderly care services. To cope with that, many researchers have dedicated themselves to advancing the medical care system based on data or platforms. However, they have ignored the life cycle, health service and management and the inevitable shift of living scenarios for the elderly. Therefore, the study aims to improve health conditions and enhance senior citizens' life quality and happiness index. In this paper, we build a unified body for people in their old age, bridging the disconnection between medical care and elderly care and constructing the ""five-in-one"" comprehensive medical care framework.

These are structure, process, and outcome. Therefore, the present study aimed at assessing the structural quality of Antenatal care (ANC) service provision in Ethiopian health facilities. Methods Data were obtained from the 2018 Ethiopian Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) survey. The SARA was a cross-sectional facility-based assessment conducted to capture health facility service availability and readiness in Ethiopia. A total of 764 health facilities were sampled in the 9 regions and 2 city administrations of the country. The availability of equipment, supplies, medicine, health worker's training and availability of guidelines were assessed. Data were collected from October-December 2017. We run a multiple linear regression model to identify predictors of health facility readiness for Antenatal care service. The level of significance was determined at a p-value < 0.05. Result Among the selected health facilities, 80.5% of them offered Antenatal care service. However, the availability of specific services was very low. The availability of tetanus toxoid vaccination, folic acid, iron supplementation, and monitoring of hypertension disorder was, 67.7, 65.6, 68.6, and 75.1%, respectively. The overall mean availability among the ten tracer items that are necessary to provide quality Antenatal care services was 50%. In the multiple linear regression model, health centers, health posts and clinics scored lower Antenatal care service readiness compared to hospitals. The overall readiness index score was lower for private health facilities (beta = - 0.047, 95% CI: (- 0.1, - 0.004). The readiness score had no association with the facility settings (Urban/Rural) (p-value > 0.05). Facilities in six regions except Dire Dawa had (beta = 0.067, 95% CI: (0.004, 0.129) lower readiness score than facilities in Tigray region (p-value < 0.015). Conclusion This analysis provides evidence of the gaps in structural readiness of health facilities to provide quality Antenatal care services. Key and essential supplies for quality Antenatal care service provision were missed in many of the health facilities.

The law introduced in 1991 initiated development of a system of contracts between public payer and the independent medical services' providers. After a few years, new legislation enabled much faster movement from an integrated model of provision towards separating a public 'third party payer' from health services providers. After reforms in 1999, in the context of poor enforcement mechanisms, unit financing rules proved to be one of the weaknesses of the Polish health care system. By enhancing a structure-disintegrating process, cost-per-case contracts destroyed those of organizational and professional networks (both formal and informal ones) which could guarantee coordinated, continuous and high quality health care for people.",0,0,managed care; health care financing; integration; GP-fundholding; capitation; contract; SERVICES,Article
Exploring the Relationships among Factors Influencing Healthcare Chatbot Adoption,"Liou, James J. H.; Vo, Tuong Thanh; MDPI; Liou, James J.

Consequently, understanding how to promote the adoption of healthcare chatbots has become crucial for enhancing the healthcare industry and medical service quality. Despite numerous studies identifying factors influencing healthcare chatbot adoption, there is a notable lack of empirical verification regarding their interrelationships, leading to a significant knowledge gap. Therefore, this study aims to address this gap by developing a decision-making model to analyze the relationships among key factors regarding three dimensions: technology, user, and society. The model begins by filtering out insignificant factors based on experts' opinions. Subsequently, it employs DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) to construct a causal relationships graph and the ISM (interpretive structural modeling) method to categorize these factors into a hierarchical order. To mitigate uncertainties stemming from the topic's complexity, this study utilizes fuzzy sets and Z-number theory in the assessment process. The findings reveal a predominance of causal factors within the technological dimension. Notably, the quality of information provided by chatbots stands out as the most influential causal factor. The insights from this study suggest implications for both enterprises and governments to boost chatbot adoption in society.",0,0,healthcare; chatbot; adoption; DEMATEL; ISM; fuzzy sets; Z-numbers; CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS; QUALITY; MODEL,Article
Organizational interventions to encourage guideline implementation,"Curry, SJ; ELSEVIER; Curry, SJ",2000,CHEST,N/A,WOS:000088878800007,USA,"Evidence-based guidelines hold considerable promise for continued improvement of health-care delivery. However, the availability of clinical practice guidelines does not automatically lead to changes in practice patterns. Using a ""push-pull-capacity"" model, this article describes strategies to improve guideline implementation for three types of organizations: national organizations, insurer and health-care organizations, and health-care purchasers, Push strategies focus on the guideline development process and include rigorous review and meta-analysis of peer-reviewed research, and use of multidisciplinary expert teams, subjecting guidelines to peer review and comment and using measurable clinical outcomes to define guidelines. Pull strategies focus on creating a demand for guideline implementation and include professional organization endorsement, quality measures based on guideline-related outcomes, and guideline-based performance objectives in purchaser contracts and physician compensation agreements. Capacity strategies focus on systems that facilitate guideline implementation. Example strategies are providing benefit coverage and reimbursement for guideline-based treatment protocols, and implementing clinical information systems for population-based tracking, outcomes monitoring, and benchmarking feedback.",0,0,clinical practice guidelines; health-care delivery; quality improvement; CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES; HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION; MEDICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES; CARE MARKETPLACE; PREVENTIVE CARE; LARGE EMPLOYERS; SERVICES; INSURANCE,Article

The review identified strategies with varying effects, including in-service training, supervision and group problem-solving. However, whether their effectiveness changed over time remained unclear. In particular, understanding whether effects decay over time is crucial to improve sustainability. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis of data from the aforementioned review to explore associations between time and effectiveness. We calculated effect sizes (defined as percentage-point (%-point) changes) for HCP practice outcomes (eg, percentage of patients correctly treated) at each follow-up time point after the strategy was implemented. We estimated the association between time and effectiveness using random-intercept linear regression models with time-specific effect sizes clustered within studies and adjusted for baseline performance. Results The primary analysis included 37 studies, and a sensitivity analysis included 77 additional studies. For training, every additional month of follow-up was associated with a 0.19 %-point decrease in effectiveness (95% CI: -0.36 to -0.03). For training combined with supervision, every additional month was associated with a 0.40 %-point decrease in effectiveness (95% CI: -0.68 to -0.12). Time trend results for supervision were inconclusive. For group problem-solving alone, time was positively associated with effectiveness, with a 0.50 %-point increase in effect per month (95% CI: 0.37 to 0.64). Group problem-solving combined with training was associated with large improvements, and its effect was not associated with time. Conclusions Time trends in the effectiveness of different strategies to improve HCP practices vary among strategies. Programmes relying solely on in-service training might need periodical refresher training or, better still, consider combining training with group problem-solving. Although more high-quality research is needed, these results, which are important for decision-makers as they choose which strategies to use, underscore the utility of studies with multiple post-implementation measurements so sustainability of the impact on HCP practices can be assessed.",0,0,health services research; implementation science; performance measures; quality improvement; standards of care; QUALITY IMPROVEMENT; CHILDREN; FACILITIES; COLLABORATIVES; PREDICTORS; MALARIA; ERROR; FEVER,Review

Sustainable Development Goal (SDG-3) is committed to ensuring good health and well-being of the people by 2030. However, this commitment heavily depends on joint efforts by local authorities and the immediate service providers to communities. This paper is set to inform the status of health service provision in local authorities in Tanzania using the determinants for quality health services in Dodoma City and Bahi District.MethodsA cross-sectional research design was employed to collect data from 400 households in the Local Government Authorities. The five-service quality (SERVQUAL) dimensions of Parasuraman were adopted to gauge the quality of service in public healthcare facilities. Descriptive statistics were used to compute the frequency and mean of the demographic information and the quality of health services, respectively. A binary logistic regression model was used to establish the influence of the demographic dimensions on the quality of health services.FindingsThe findings revealed that quality health services have not been realised for healthcare seekers. Further, the area of residence, education, and occupation are significantly associated with the perceived quality of health service delivery in the Local Government Authorities.ConclusionThe healthcare facilities under the LGAs offer services whose quality is below the healthcare seekers' expectations.

We investigate four health system configurations depending on whether the GP refers and the specialist treats only high-severity patients or patients with any severity. We show that an increase in the GP fee, which induces GPs to refer only high-severity patients, increases utilitarian welfare but also increases inequities in access to specialist visits.

We aimed to establish a scientific and effective resilience capability assessment scale for grassroots medical workers and explore the way to improve resilience. Research design Developed a resilience ability assessment scale and applied it on the medical personnel who worked in community health service centers for more than 1 year. Related indicators were identified through literature review and the Delphi method. The established scale was given weight using the attribute analytic hierarchy process, and the evaluation model was built through the grey correlation analysis. Principal findings A three-level indicator scale was established, which included three first-level indicators [professional quality (weight 0.346), psychological capital (weight 0.614), and emergency attitude (weight 0.040)]. The second-level indicators had 13 contents and were further subdivided into 46 three-level indicators. The overall resilience ability assessment score of 347 medical workers in Guangzhou was only 0.787. However, steady scientific-exercise habits and relative training can help improve their public health emergency resilience ability (p < 0.05). Conclusion The establishment of the scale can provide a strategic basis for improving the resilience strength of grass-roots medical personnel. We should encourage this group to form a good habit of exercise, strengthen their crisis awareness by actively organizing theoretical training and practical exercises on public health emergencies, and improve their psychological capital level.

Readiness, denoting stages of behavior change, exerts a substantial influence on its uptake. However, the characteristics and impacts of advance care planning interventions on readiness are not well-established. Method: We systematically reviewed and conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of advance care planning interventions on readiness. Studies were appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools. Meta-analyses were performed using mean difference of continuous variables or risk ratios of binary variables and their 95 % confidence interval as the pooled effect sizes. Results: Eight studies were included in this review and were all rated low quality. Meta-analysis showed that interventions resulted in slight improvement in overall readiness (mean difference = 0.19, 95 % confidence interval: 0.02-0.36) for advance care planning. However, statistically significant effects of interventions were not identified for readiness in relation to specific behaviors (appointment of a healthcare proxy, talking to a healthcare proxy, talking to a medical practitioner about living wills, and signing a living will). Conclusion: Our meta-analyses demonstrated that interventions can improve the overall readiness for advance care planning, suggesting the necessity to integrate readiness into future health policies and clinical practices. Nevertheless, the absence of significant effects on specific behavioral readiness underscores the requirement for additional refinement in intervention design, advanced technologies, and theoretical foundations.

Composite quality measures derived from administrative and clinical information systems could support system-wide surgical quality improvement by providing a simple metric that can be evaluated over time. The aim of this systematic review was to identify published studies of composite measures used to assess the overall quality of abdominal surgical services at a hospital or population level.Methods A search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE for references describing measurement instruments evaluating the overall quality of abdominal surgery. Instruments combining multiple process and quality indicators into a single composite quality score were included. The identified instruments were described in terms of transparency, justification, handling of missing data, case-mix adjustment, scale branding and choice of weight and uncertainty to assess their relative strengths and weaknesses (PROSPERO registration: CRD42022345074).Results Of 5234 manuscripts screened, 13 were included. Ten unique composite quality measures were identified, mostly developed within the past decade. Outcome measures such as mortality rate (40 per cent), length of stay (40 per cent), complication rate (60 per cent) and morbidity rate (70 per cent) were consistently included. A major challenge for all instruments is the reliance of valid administrative data and the challenges of assigning appropriate weights to the underlying instrument components. A conceptual framework for composite measures of surgical quality was developed.Conclusion None of the composite quality measures identified demonstrated marked superiority over others. The degree to which administrative and clinical data influences each composite measure differs in important ways. There is a need for further testing and development of these measures.",0,0,HARM SCORE; OF-CARE; COMPLICATIONS; OUTCOMES; TOOL,Review

The study population comprised patients who visited KM hospitals for the first time between June and November 2017 for persistent or recurrent pain and discomfort after low back, neck, shoulder, or knee surgery. Various validated questionnaires were used to collect data. A total of 100 participants were enrolled, and the majority had undergone low back surgery (n = 82). The participants had received 1.3 +/- 0.7 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations and 2.4 +/- 2.8 X-rays before surgery. Conventional interventions used before surgery were physical therapy (43%), medications (34%), and injections (28%), in descending order, while 48% of patients reported having received acupuncture 51.3 +/- 81.1 times. The mean satisfaction score for surgery was 5.5 +/- 2.8 points based on a 9-point Likert scale, while that for KM-based interventions was 6.3 +/- 1.7 points. With respect to health-related information, the mean scores were 6.0 +/- 2.2 points on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), 0.6 +/- 0.2 points on the 5-Level EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L), and 15.3 +/- 10.2 on Beck's Depression Index II (BDI-II). The mean score on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) in patients with low back pain was 40.1 +/- 19.2 points. Work impairment, as measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health (WPAI-GH), was 62.5 +/- 47.8%, while activity impairment was 5.9 +/- 2.6%. Participants tended to show low satisfaction regarding surgery and high preference for KM-based interventions. In particular, low back surgery patients reported high ODI scores, indicating high dysfunctional levels and poor prognosis after surgery. It can be inferred that it is therefore important to provide appropriate presurgical and postsurgical care for patients with musculoskeletal pain to improve pain, function, and quality of life.",0,0,LUMBAR SPINAL STENOSIS; LONG-TERM OUTCOMES; NONSURGICAL MANAGEMENT; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; KNEE ARTHROPLASTY; REVISION SURGERY; DISABILITY INDEX; DISC HERNIATION; COMPLEMENTARY; ACUPUNCTURE,Article

Nine hospital departments were chosen to change their management control system from a strict top-down productivity focus to a locally developed performance measurement system based on a patient focus. Thus, the management control system was changed with the aim of enhancing the social impact of the provided hospital services by integrating a patient focus. The paper portrays a three-year evolution through management narratives. Findings evidence initial embracement of the project followed by gradual operational management discouragement due to external productivity pressures and internal data issues. Despite these challenges, the regional management highlighted the project as a success and expanded it to the remaining departments. Thus, we find that the project became decoupled rather than institutionalized due to a sustained productivity logic. Through the lens of institutional theory, we argue that a decoupling of the patient focused project happens because of a surprisingly strong institutionalized productivity logic. We suggest that in this context of strong coupling of previous systems, organizations may paradoxically engage in decoupling practices that are intended to support their professional core practices but instead protect the administrative logic of efficiency and productivity.

This study aims to develop a nurse-led eHealth cardiac rehabilitation (NeCR) intervention and investigate its effectiveness on coronary heart disease (CHD) patients' health outcomes. Methods This single-blinded two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial will randomize 146 patients from the inpatient cardiovascular units of a hospital in Wuhan, China to receive either the NeCR or the usual care. The NeCR intervention uses a hybrid approach consisting of a brief face-to-face preparatory phase and an empowerment phase delivered by health technology. The preparatory phase aims at identifying self-care needs, developing a goal-oriented patient centered action plan, incorporating a peer support network and orientation to the use of the e-platform. The empowerment phase includes use of the multi-media interactive NeCR for promoting symptom management, monitoring lifestyle changes and offering psychological support. A tele-care platform is also integrated to enhance health care dialogue with health professionals and peer groups. The control group will receive the usual care. An evaluation of lifestyle behavioral changes, self-efficacy, health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression, cardiovascular risk parameters, and unplanned health services use will be conducted at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention. Discussion This protocol proposes an individualized, comprehensive, and interactive NeCR delivered using a hybrid approach and guided by an empowerment model to optimize health outcomes of CHD patients. The intervention content and web-design is based on international health guidelines to improve credibility, comprehensibility and implementation. This study also proposes a new method of peer support in which the researcher shares participants' progress toward goal attainment with the peer group.

It is characterised by mucosal damage of the small intestine caused by dietary gluten. The main treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong gluten-free diet, which can reduce morbidity and mortality and also improve quality of life. Despite the benefits, adhering to this diet is often challenging, with patients often struggling to sustain dietary restriction. Structured follow-up for coeliac disease is recommended in international guidelines for improving adherence and for detecting complications; however, uncertainty exists concerning exactly who should be administering this follow-up care. Here, we undertake a review of the current approaches described in the literature to follow-up patients with coeliac disease, and assess the efficacy of these differing models. We also explore future directions for the care of these patients in the context of the UK National Health Service (a publicly funded healthcare system). Although the focus of this review pertains to follow-up within the UK healthcare system, these problems are recognised to be international, and so the findings of our review are likely to be of interest to all healthcare professionals seeing and managing patients with coeliac disease.",0,0,adherence; coeliac disease; efficacy; follow-up; GLUTEN-FREE DIET; FOLLOW-UP; CLINICAL-FEATURES; ADULT PATIENTS; POPULATION; DIAGNOSIS; MORTALITY; ADHERENCE; PREVALENCE; MALIGNANCY,Review

Maintaining physiology of brain tissue to the greatest extent possible through optimal management of blood pressure, airway, ventilation, and oxygenation, improves patient outcome. We studied the quality of prehospital care in severe TBI patients by analyzing adherence to recommended target ranges for ventilation and blood pressure, prehospital time expenditure, and their effect on mortality, as well as quality of prehospital ventilation assessed by arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) at hospital admission.MethodsThis is a retrospective cohort study of all TBI patients requiring tracheal intubation on scene who were transported to one of two major level 1 trauma centers in Switzerland between January 2014 and December 2019 by Swiss Air Rescue (Rega). We assessed systolic blood pressure (SBP), end-tidal partial pressure of CO2 (PetCO2), and PaCO2 at hospital admission as well as prehospital and on-scene time. Quality markers of prehospital care (PetCO2, SBP, prehospital times) and prehospital ventilation (PaCO2) are presented as descriptive analysis. Effect on mortality was calculated by multivariable regression analysis and a logistic general additive model.ResultsOf 557 patients after exclusions, 308 were analyzed. Adherence to blood pressure recommendations was 89%. According to PetCO2, 45% were normoventilated, and 29% had a SBP & GE; 90 mm Hg and were normoventilated. Due to the poor correlation between PaCO2 and PetCO2, only 33% were normocapnic at hospital admission. Normocapnia at hospital admission was strongly associated with reduced probability of mortality. Prehospital and on-scene times had no impact on mortality.ConclusionsPaCO2 at hospital admission is strongly associated with mortality risk, but normocapnia is achieved only in a minority of patients. Therefore, the time required for placement of an arterial cannula and prehospital blood gas analysis may be warranted in severe TBI patients requiring on-scene tracheal intubation.",0,0,Prehospital emergency medicine; HEMS; Traumatic brain injury; Tracheal intubation; Ventilation; EMERGENCY MEDICAL-SERVICE; SEVERE HEAD-INJURY; BLOOD-PRESSURE; GOLDEN HOUR; HYPOTENSION; MANAGEMENT; GUIDELINES; TIME; RUN; RESUSCITATION,Article

Advance care planning conversations that establish a patient's wishes and preferences for care are part of a person-centered approach. Internationally, electronic health record systems are digital interventions used to record and share patients' advance care plans across health careservices and settings. They aim to provide tools that support electronic information sharing and care coordination. Within the United Kingdom, Electronic Palliative Care Coordination Systems (EPaCCS) are an example of this. Despite over a decade of policy promoting EPaCCS nationally, there has been limited implementation and consistently low levels of use by health professionals. Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the factors that influence the implementation of EPaCCS into routine clinicalpractice across different care services and settings in 2 major regions of England. Methods: A qualitative interview study design was used, guided by Normalization Process Theory (NPT). NPT explores factorsaffecting the implementation of complex interventions and consists of 4 primary components (coherence, cognitive participation,collective action, and reflexive monitoring). Health care and social care practitioners were purposively sampled based on theirprofessional role and work setting. Individual web-based semistructured interviews were conducted. Data were analyzed usingthematic framework analysis to explore issues which affected the implementation of EPaCCS across different settings at individual,team, organizational, and technical levels. Results: Participants (N=52) representing a range of professional roles were recruited across 6 care settings (hospice, primarycare, care home, hospital, ambulatory, and community). In total, 6 themes were developed which mapped onto the 4 primarycomponents of NPT and represented the multilevel influences affecting implementation. At an individual level, these included(1) EPaCCS providing a clear and distinct way of working and (2) collective contributions and buy-in. At a team and organizationallevel, these included (3) embedding EPaCCS into everyday practice and (4) championing driving implementation. At a technicallevel, these included (5) electronic functionality, interoperability, and access. Breakdowns in implementation at different levelsled to variations in (6) confidence and trust in EPaCCS in terms of record accuracy and availability of access Conclusions: EPaCCS implementation is influenced by individual, organizational, and technical factors. Key challenges includeproblems with access alongside inconsistent use and engagement across care settings. EPaCCS, in their current format as digitaladvance care planning systems are not consistently facilitating electronic information sharing and care coordination. A redesignof EPaCCS is likely to be necessary to determine configurations for their optimal implementation across different settings andlocations. This includes supporting health care practitioners to document, access, use, and share information across multiple caresettings.

According to the model of person-environment fit, individuals with high levels of everyday competence have the ability to solve problems associated with everyday life. Nursing home residents with high levels of everyday competence and low care needs have poor person-environment fit, placing them at risk for declines in function, maladaptive behavior, and affective disorders. The goal of this article is to present a framework for the integration of everyday competence with standardized goal-setting and care-planning processes to enable the transition of appropriate nursing home residents back to the community. Barriers to community transitions exist across several Key Domains: rehabilitation, personal assistance and services, caregiver support, finances, housing, and transportation. We propose a research agenda to develop and implement a toolkit based on this framework that nursing home staff can use to overcome barriers to transition by (1) assessing residents' everyday competence, (2) developing personally meaningful goals that facilitate transition, and (3) conducting structured care planning to support resident goals around returning to the community. If successful, this toolkit has the potential to reduce costs associated with nursing home care and to improve functional health, psychological well-being, and quality of life for older adults. The proposed framework and toolkit complement national efforts focused on transitioning nursing home residents back into the community.

The collected data relate to judgments issued in Italy until December 2022 regarding 30 episodes of falls that occurred between 2003 and 2018. Our research revealed that approximately 50% of Italian healthcare organizations lose the case in court when a patient falls in a hospital setting and dies or is injured. In half of these cases, the failure of the medical staff to use protective equipment against falls is what led to the court's acceptance of the compensation claim.

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) revitalizes a healthcare infrastructure by creating an interconnected, intelligent, accessible, and efficient network. While there have been many studies on possible device authentication techniques for the IoMT, there is still much work to be done in user authentication to provide sustainable IoT solutions. Graphical passwords, which use visual content such as images instead of traditional text-based passwords, can help users authenticate themselves. However, current schemes have limitations. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel graphical authentication scheme that uses multiple factors to register and authenticate users using simple arithmetic operations, machine learning for hand gesture recognition, and medical images for recall purposes. The proposed method is designed to keep the authentication process simple, memorable, and robust. To evaluate the proposed scheme, we use the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) to compare it with PIN-based and pattern-based authentication techniques. While comparing treatment and comparison groups, system quality showed a 16.7% better score, information quality a 25% increase, interface quality a 40% increase, and overall quality showed a 25% increase.

Some of these direct payments take the form of informal charges paid by patients to access the needed healthcare services. Remarkably, however, little is known about the extent to which these payments are exercised and their determinants in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. This study attempts therefore to shed light on the role of supply-side factors in the occurrence of informal payments while accounting for the demand-side factors. The study relies on data taken from a nationally representative survey conducted among people living with HIV/AIDS in Cameroon. A multilevel mixed-effect logistic model is employed to identify the factors associated with the incidence of informal payments. Results reveal that circa 3.05% of the surveyed patients incurred informal payments for the consultations made on the day of the survey. The amount paid informally represents up to four times the official tariff. Factors related to the following: (i) human resource management of the health facilities (e.g., task shifting); (ii) health professionals' perceptions vis-a-vis the remunerations of HIV care provision; and (iii) reception of patients (e.g., waiting time) significantly influence the probability of incurring informal payments. Also of note, the type of healthcare facilities is found to play a role: informal payments appear to be significantly lower in private non-profit facilities compared with those belonging to public sector. Our findings allude to some policy recommendations that can help reduce the incidence of informal payments.

Researchers conducted a structured questionnaire survey on 337 users of mHealth apps in these regions to measure their self-reported responses to seven constructs: information quality, system quality, service quality, perceived usefulness, confirmation, satisfaction, and continuance intention. The study uses the structural equation model-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) approach to interpret the compensatory and non-linear relationships between predictors and continuance intention. The findings reveal that user satisfaction and perceived usefulness significantly predict the continuance intention to use mHealth apps. All other relationships were confirmed except for the non-significant relationships between service quality and confirmation, service quality and perceived usefulness, and system quality and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, based on the normalized importance obtained from the multilayer perceptron, the most critical predictors identified were satisfaction (100%), followed by information quality (70.2%), perceived usefulness (43.2%), system quality (25.1%), and confirmation (17.6%). Finally, this study presents theoretical and practical implications for the continuance intention towards mHealth apps in Southwest China's ethnic minority regions.",0,0,Quality elements; Southwest ethnic minority regions; Mobile health apps; Mixed research methods; EXPECTATION-CONFIRMATION MODEL; INFORMATION-SYSTEMS SUCCESS; SATISFACTION; INTENTION; ADOPTION; CARE,Article

Biogeographical data subdivided the genus Paracoccidioides in five divergent subgroups, which have been recently classified as different species. Genomic sequencing of five Paracoccidioides isolates, representing each of these subgroups/species provided an important framework for the development of post-genomic studies with these fungi. However, functional annotations of these genomes have not been submitted to manual curation and, as a result, similar to 60-90% of the Paracoccidioides protein-coding genes (depending on isolate/annotation) are currently described as responsible for hypothetical proteins, without any further functional/structural description.",0,0,TRANSCRIPTOME ANALYSIS; HYPOTHETICAL PROTEINS; BRASILIENSIS,Article

The extent to which they meet criteria for programme quality, particularly in relation to transparency of reporting and evaluation, is unclear.Aim To identify large-scale improvement programmes focused on intrapartum care implemented in English National Health Service maternity services in the period 2010-2023, and to conduct a structured quality assessment.Methods We drew on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidance to inform the design and reporting of our study. We identified relevant programmes using multiple search strategies of grey literature, research databases and other sources. Programmes that met a prespecified definition of improvement programme, that focused on intrapartum care and that had a retrievable evaluation report were subject to structured assessment using selected features of programme quality.Results We identified 1434 records via databases and other sources. 14 major initiatives in English maternity services could not be quality assessed due to lack of a retrievable evaluation report. Quality assessment of the 15 improvement programmes meeting our criteria for assessment found highly variable quality and reporting. Programme specification was variable and mostly low quality. Only eight reported the evidence base for their interventions. Description of implementation support was poor and none reported customisation for challenged services. None reported reduction of inequalities as an explicit goal. Only seven made use of explicit patient and public involvement practices, and only six explicitly used published theories/models/frameworks to guide implementation. Programmes varied in their reporting of the planning, scope and design of evaluation, with weak designs evident.Conclusions Poor transparency of reporting and weak or absent evaluation undermine large-scale improvement programmes by limiting learning and accountability. This review indicates important targets for improving quality in large-scale programmes.",0,0,health services research; healthcare quality improvement; health policy; obstetrics and gynecology; womens health; HEALTH-CARE; PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT; PATIENT; IMPACT; UNITS; UK,Review
