Some Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities offer homeless-tailored primary care clinics, although such tailoring is not required, within or outside VA. Whether services tailoring enhances care for depression is unstudied.ObjectiveTo determine whether PEH in homeless-tailored primary care settings receive higher quality of depression care, compared to PEH in usual VA primary care.DesignRetrospective cohort study of depression treatment among a regional cohort of VA primary care patients (2016-2019).ParticipantsPEH diagnosed or treated for a depressive disorder.Main MeasuresThe quality measures were timely follow-up care (3 + completed visits with a primary care or mental health specialist provider, or 3 + psychotherapy sessions) within 84 days of a positive PHQ-2 screen result, timely follow-up care within 180 days, and minimally appropriate treatment (4 + mental health visits, 3 + psychotherapy visits, 60 + days antidepressant) within 365 days. We applied multivariable mixed-effect logistic regressions to model differences in care quality for PEH in homeless-tailored versus usual primary care settings.Key ResultsThirteen percent of PEH with depressive disorders received homeless-tailored primary care (n = 374), compared to usual VA primary care (n = 2469). Tailored clinics served more PEH who were Black, who were non-married, and who had low income, serious mental illness, and substance use disorders. Among all PEH, 48% received timely follow-up care within 84 days of depression screening, 67% within 180 days, and 83% received minimally appropriate treatment. Quality metric attainment was higher for PEH in homeless-tailored clinics, compared to PEH in usual VA primary care: follow-up within 84 days (63% versus 46%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.61, p = .001), follow-up within 180 days (78% versus 66%; AOR = 1.51, p = .003), and minimally appropriate treatment (89% versus 82%; AOR = 1.58, p = .004).ConclusionsHomeless-tailored primary care approaches may improve depression care for PEH.",0,0,primary care; depression; homelessness; veterans; MENTAL-HEALTH INTEGRATION; SYSTEM ASSOCIATIONS; TREATMENT SEEKING; HOUSING 1ST; SERVICE USE; ADULTS; IMPACT; INITIATION; SETTINGS; FIDELITY,Article

We describe the impact of a novel clinical pathway developed to better meet the needs of autistic patients with EDs on the length and cost of hospital admissions. Method The pathway was based on the Institute for Healthcare's Model of Improvement methodology, using an iterative Plan, Do, Study, Act format to introduce change and to co-produce the work with people with lived experience and with healthcare professionals. We explored the change in length and cost of admissions before and after the pathway was introduced. Results Preliminary results suggest that the treatment innovations associated with this pathway have led to reduced lengths of admission for patients with the comorbidity, which were not seen for patients without the comorbidity. Estimated cost-savings were approximately 22,837 pound per patient and approximately 275,000 pound per year for the service as a whole. Conclusion Going forward, our aim is to continue to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of investment in the pathway to determine whether the pathway improves the quality of care for patients with a comorbid ED and autism and is good value for money.",3,0,autism spectrum disorders; eating disorders; health economics; treatment; ADOLESCENTS; CARE,Article
"""The support has been brilliant"": experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients attending two high performing cancer services","Taylor, Emma, V; Lyford, Marilyn; Holloway, Michele; Parsons, Lorraine; Mason, Toni; Sabesan, Sabe; Thompson, Sandra C.; BMC; Taylor, Emma, V; Lyford, Marilyn; Holloway, Michele; Parsons, Lorraine; Thompson, Sandra C.; Mason, Toni; Sabesan, Sabe; Taylor, Emma, V; Thompson, Sandra; Lyford, Marilyn; Taylor, Emma; Taylor, Emma",2021,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,10.1186/s12913-021-06535-9,WOS:000657830500003,Australia,"Background Improving health outcomes for Indigenous people by providing person-centred, culturally safe care is a crucial challenge for the health sector, both in Australia and internationally. Many cancer providers and support services are committed to providing high quality care, yet struggle with providing accessible, culturally safe cancer care to Indigenous Australians. Two Australian cancer services, one urban and one regional, were identified as particularly focused on providing culturally safe cancer care for Indigenous cancer patients and their families. The article explores the experiences of Indigenous cancer patients and their families within the cancer services and ascertains how their experiences of care matches with the cancer services' strategies to improve care. Methods Services were identified as part of a national study designed to identify and assess innovative services for Indigenous cancer patients and their families. Case studies were conducted with a small number of identified services. In-depth interviews were conducted with Indigenous people affected by cancer and hospital staff. The interviews from two services, which stood out as particularly high performing, were analysed through the lens of the patient experience. Results Eight Indigenous people affected by cancer and 23 hospital staff (Indigenous and non-Indigenous) were interviewed. Three experiences were shared by the majority of Indigenous cancer patients and family members interviewed in this study: a positive experience while receiving treatment at the cancer service; a challenging time between receiving diagnosis and reaching the cancer centre; and the importance of family support, while acknowledging the burden on family and carers. Conclusions This article is significant because it demonstrates that with a culturally appropriate and person-centred approach, involving patients, family members, Indigenous and non-Indigenous staff, it is possible for Indigenous people to have positive experiences of cancer care in mainstream, tertiary health services. If we are to improve health outcomes for Indigenous people it is vital more cancer services and hospitals follow the lead of these two services and make a sustained and ongoing commitment to strengthening the cultural safety of their service.",0,0,Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander; Indigenous Australians; Cancer services; Cancer care; Cultural safety; HEALTH-CARE; INDIGENOUS AUSTRALIANS; NORTHERN-TERRITORY; NEW-ZEALAND; PEOPLE; DISPARITIES; COMMUNICATION; DIAGNOSIS; SURVIVAL; NEEDS,Article

Treatment options for people experiencing bipolar depression are limited to three interventions listed by National Institute for Health and Care: lamotrigine, quetiapine and olanzapine, of which the latter two are often not well tolerated. The majority of depressed people with BD are therefore prescribed antidepressants despite limited efficacy. This demonstrates an unmet need for additional interventions. Pramipexole has been shown to improve mood symptoms in animal models of depression, in people with Parkinson's Disease and two proof of principle trials of pramipexole for people with BD who are currently depressed.MethodsThe PAX-BD study, funded by the United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health Research, aims to extend previous findings by assessing the efficacy, safety and health economic impact of pramipexole in addition to mood stabilisers for patients with TRBD. A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled design is conducted in a naturalistic UK National Health Service setting. An internal pilot study to examine feasibility and acceptability of the study design is included. Participants with TRBD are screened from National Health Service secondary care services in up to 40 mental health trusts in the UK, with the aim of recruiting approximately 414 participants into a pre-randomisation phase to achieve a target of 290 randomised participants. Primary safety and efficacy measures are at 12weeks following randomisation, with follow up of participants to 52weeks. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms as measured by Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report. Secondary outcomes include changes in anxiety, manic symptoms, tolerability, acceptability, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Outcome measures are collected remotely using self-report tools implemented online, and observer-rated assessments conducted via telephone. ANCOVA will be used to examine the difference in rating scale scores between treatment arms, and dependent on compliance in completion of weekly self-report measures.

However, differences among patients regarding how pain impacts on daily life are remarkable. The main aim of this study was to identify clinical and pain-related cognitive variables characterizing patients reporting high adaptability despite experiencing severe chronic pain. Methods Two hundred and eighty-three Spanish patients with FM with high levels of pain were classified into 2 groups: (1) those reporting low impact of the syndrome, and (2) those with moderate-to-high impact. Perceived stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms along with pain catastrophizing, psychological inflexibility, and perceived control over pain were evaluated. Differences in sociodemographics, years with FM, past/current major depressive disorder comorbidity, and health-related economic costs (ie, medications, use of medical services, lost productivity due to sick leave) were also assessed. Stepwise logistic regression analyses predicting group membership from clinical variables and pain-related cognitive processes as predictors were performed. Results Lower stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, along with reduced pain catastrophism, psychological inflexibility, and perceived control over pain, were found in the low-impact group. Significant predictors of group membership (low-impact vs. moderate-to-high impact) in regression analyses were ""cognitive fusion"" (psychological inflexibility), ""helplessness"" (pain catastrophizing), and depressive symptomatology, together with pain intensity and other FM symptoms. Conclusions The present study provides further evidence on resilience resources in chronic pain by identifying some variables (ie, reduced depressive symptomatology, pain catastrophizing, and psychological inflexibility) differentially characterizing a profile of patients with FM who are especially able to adapt to high levels of pain.",0,0,fibromyalgia; pain; impact; adaptability; catastrophism; psychological inflexibility; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; DISABILITY; PREVALENCE,Article

Work-relative value units (wRVUs), the basis for Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and private payer reimbursements, commonly serve to estimate physician productivity. Limited data describes which practice factors predict increased wRVU productivity. METHODS The 2017 and 2018 CMS databases were retrospectively queried for urologic Medicare provider demographics and procedural/service details. Medical school graduation year was used to estimate years in practice and generation (Millennial, Gen X, Baby Boomer, or Post-War). Treated patients' demographics were obtained. Adjusted and unadjusted linear mixed models were performed to predict wRVU production. RESULTS Included were 6773 Medicare-participating urologists across the United States. Millennials produced 1115 wRVUs per year, while Gen X and Baby Boomers produced significantly more (1997 and 2104, respectively, P < .01). Post-War urologists produced numerically more (1287, P = .88). In adjusted analyses, predictors of Medicare wRVU productivity included female and pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (exponentiated beta estimate (beta) 1.46, 95% CI 1.321.60), men's health (beta 1.22, 95% CI 1.13-1.32), and oncologic subspecialization (beta 1.08, 95% CI 1.02-1.14), female gender (beta 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.92), wRVUs generated from inpatient procedures (beta 1.08, 95% CI 1.06-1.09) and office visits (beta 0.88, 95% CI 0.87-0.89), and the level of education (beta 1.10, 95% CI 1.07-1.14) and percent impoverished patients (beta 0.85, 95% CI 0.830.88) in provider's practice zip code. CONCLUSION Urologic experience, specialization, demographics, practice patterns, and patient demographics are significantly associated with wRVU productivity in Medicare settings.

""Shared care,"" delivered by both oncologists and primary care providers (PCPs), may better address these needs. Little information is available on differences in outcomes among survivors receiving shared care versus oncologist-led or PCP-led care. This study compared experiences of care for survivors receiving shared care, oncologist-led, PCP-led, or other care patterns. Methods We used SEER-CAHPS data, including NCI's SEER registry data, Medicare claims, and Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey responses. Medicare Fee-for-Service beneficiaries age >= 65 years in SEER-CAHPS with breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, renal, or prostate cancers or hematologic malignancies who responded to a Medicare CAHPS survey >= 18 months post-diagnosis were included. CAHPS measures included ratings of overall care, personal doctor, specialist physician, health plan, prescription drug plan, and five composite scores. Survivorship care patterns were identified using proportions of oncologist, PCP, and other physician encounters. Multivariable regressions examined associations between care patterns and CAHPS outcomes. Results Among 10,132 survivors, 15% received shared care, 10% oncologist-led, 33% PCP-led, and 42% other. Compared with shared care, we found no significant differences in experiences of care except for getting needed drugs (lower scores for PCP-led and other care patterns). Sensitivity analyses using different patterns of care definitions similarly showed no associations between survivorship care pattern and experience of care. Conclusions Within the limitations of the study dataset, survivors age 65+ receiving shared care reported similar experiences of care to those receiving oncologist-led, PCP-led, and other patterns of care.

Median centers' proportion was calculated and overall proportion for every indicator. Two-sided Cochran-Armitage tests were applied to detect trends over time. Results The number of primary cases increased for both groups steadily from 2015 to 2017 as did fulfillment of most other indicators including PCa guideline-derived indicators. Requirements that proved to be hard to fulfill for PCCoG initially included psycho-oncological services (POS) and social service counselling (SCC). Fulfillment of POS requirements improved in the following years after initial certification in PCCoG. SCC rates remain low in PCCoG due to the different health system structures. Conclusion Acquiring a certificate by the DKG is achievable for PCCoG. Candidate centers need to be aware that substantial effort is required to fulfill the criteria, but once this is done, typically an improvement of indicators and an increase in patient numbers can be observed. Different health-care systems need to be taken into consideration and the certification requirements adapted in different areas to allow country-specific implementation.",0,0,Quality assurance; Quality indicators; Health service research; Certification,Article
Patient and Family Member Experiences in Critical Care Research and Quality Improvement Projects,"Bench, Suzanne; O'Shea, Alison; Boaz, Annette; LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS; Bench, Suzanne; Bench, Suzanne; Bench, Suzanne; O'Shea, Alison; Boaz, Annette; Bench, Suzanne; Bench, Suzanne; Bench, Suzanne",2020,NURSING RESEARCH,10.1097/NNR.0000000000000443,WOS:000570067300007,England,"Background Public and patient involvement in healthcare research is increasing, but the effect of involvement on individuals, service delivery, and health outcomes-particularly in specialist population groups like critical care-remains unclear, as does the best way to involve people who have experienced critical illness. Objectives The aim of the study was to explore former patients' and family members' views and experiences of involvement in critical care research and/or quality improvement. Methods Using a qualitative methodology, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with seven former intensive care unit patients and three close family members across England. Data were analyzed using a standard process of inductive thematic analysis. Results Four key themes were identified: making it happen, overcoming hurdles, it helps, and respect and value. Findings center on the need for flexibility, inclusivity, and transparency. They further highlight the particular challenges faced by critical illness survivors and their family members in relation to research involvement, the importance of individualized support and training, and the vital role that project leads have in making people feel valued and equal partners in the process. Discussion This is the first study to explore patients' experiences of involvement in critical care research. Despite the small, homogenous sample, the study provides valuable and important data to guide future practice. It highlights the need to enable and support people to make informed choices at a time when they are ready to do so. It further highlights the importance of gatekeepers to avoid vulnerable people contributing before they are ready-a practice that could negatively affect their health status.",0,0,critical care; patient participation; qualitative research; PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT; HEALTH-CARE; IMPACT,Article
Manifestation of Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Its Association With Somatic Symptoms Among Occupational and Physical Therapists During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Alnaser, Musaed Z.; Alotaibi, Naser; Nadar, Mohammed Sh.; Manee, Fahad; Alrowayeh, Hesham N.; FRONTIERS MEDIA SA; Nadar, Mohammed; Manee, Fahad; Alnaser, Musaed; Alotaibi, Naser",2022,FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH,10.3389/fpubh.2022.891276,WOS:000805892800001,N/A,"PurposeThe purpose of the study was to examine the level of generalized anxiety disorder among occupational and physical therapists during treatment sessions and its association with somatic symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional design was used in this study. Data were collected during the month of April 2021, and the study included occupational and physical therapists who practiced during COVID-19 from March 2020 to March 2021. The generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) and a modified patient health questionnaire (mPHQ-15) were used to examine self-reported anxiety and somatic symptoms among the study participants. The independent t-test was used to determine differences between groups based on GAD-7 and mPHQ-15 results. Spearman's correlation test and chi-squared test were used to find the relationships between different variables such as anxiety and somatic symptoms. ResultsThe study (n = 98 participants) included 56 occupational and 42 physical therapists. An 84% response rate was achieved. GAD-7 final score was mu = 9.21 +/- 5.63 with 27% reporting no anxiety, 14% mild, 38% moderate, and 21% severe. Independent t-tests on GAD-7 scores showed significant differences between therapist specializations [t((96)) = -2.256; p = 0.026] and between therapists residing with or without their parents [t((96)) = -2.536; p = 0.013]. The mPHQ-15 final score was mu = 9.52 +/- 5.54 with 13% reporting no symptoms (n = 13), 20% mild (n = 20), 38% moderate (n = 37), and 29% severe (n = 28). GAD-7 and mPHQ-15 scores were moderately positively correlated [r((96)) = 0.569; p x((9, N = 98))(2) = 70.62 p <0.000]. Therapists reported that the quality (76%) and effectiveness (20%) of their rehabilitation services were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. ConclusionThe majority of study participants experienced moderate to severe anxiety and associated somatic symptoms. During COVID-19, ongoing psychological counseling of healthcare professionals such as occupational and physical therapists is required to maintain positive mental health. Implications for practice are presented.",0,0,psychological symptoms; physical symptoms; mental health; healthcare professionals; occupational therapists; physical therapists; anxiety; somatic; HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; SAUDI-ARABIA; IMPACT,Article

Pandemic hospitals and reorganizing emergency departments,"Kayipmaz, Afsin Emre; Demircan, Ahmet; Tubitak Scientific & Technological Research Council Turkey; Kayipmaz, Afsin Emre; Kayipmaz, Afsin Emre; Demircan, Ahmet; Demircan, Ahmet; Kayipmaz, Afsin Emre; Kayipmaz, Afsin Emre; Demircan, Ahmet; Demircan, AHMET; Kayıpmaz, Afşin Emre; Kayipmaz, Afsin Emre",2021,TURKISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES,10.3906/sag-2106-169,WOS:000802305600008,Turkey,"Emergency departments have always been the first point of contact for hospitals in many situations, including man-made and natural disasters. The first places where patients with symptoms of COVID-19 were met in health institutions were also emergency departments. Emergency departments play an important role in diagnosing the disease and isolating patients (by hospitalization if necessary). The process, which starts with the triage of outpatients admitted to the emergency department and brought by ambulance, continues as isolation of the patients in appropriate areas including physical evaluation, management of laboratory and scanning processes and, if necessary, providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation with airway support. Afterwards, patients can be treated as an outpatient, or hospitalized, or treated at the intensive care unit in line with their preliminary diagnosis and clinical conditions. Disruptions that may occur in one or more of these stages can lead to crowds and lengthy queues in the emergency department by prolonging the follow-up period of the patients. One of the strengths of Turkey at this point is that emergency departments are accustomed to the heavy patient load. The experiences gained from these conditions have facilitated the organization of pre-hospital emergency medical services, pandemic hospitals, and their emergency departments. In this organization, the main goal should be to provide uninterrupted and high-quality patient care through personnel training, personal protection measures, and the creation of physical conditions. Turkey's emergency departments are accustomed to managing the intensive patient flow, as they work at full capacity during normal times. Thanks to the experiences of emergency healthcare workers, health service was provided without any patient being turned away from the door of the emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, we aimed to present the organization of pandemic hospitals and emergency departments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We made a schematic representation of the architectural areas through the emergency department of Ankara City Hospital, which has a bed capacity of 4200 with 256 beds in emergency department.",0,0,COVID-19 pandemics; disasters; emergency treatment; emergencies; COVID-19,Review
Communicative participation outcomes in individuals with Parkinson's disease receiving standard care speech-language therapy services in community settings,"Baylor, Carolyn; Jin, Jingyu Linna; Mach, Helen; Britton, Deanna; WILEY; Baylor, Carolyn; Jin, Jingyu Linna; Mach, Helen; Britton, Deanna; Baylor, Carolyn; Jin, Jingyu; Mach, Helen",2024,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS,10.1111/1460-6984.12965,WOS:001085430300001,USA,"Background The Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB) is a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) designed to measure the extent of interference, or difficulty, experienced by adults with communication disorders participating in their day-to-day communication activities. To date, there is limited evidence regarding sensitivity of the CPIB for capturing change with intervention in people with Parkinson's disease (PwPD).Aims The purpose of this study was to examine the following measurement properties of the CPIB in PwPD who received community-based, standard care, speech-language therapy focusing on motor speech concerns: Change over time between treatment and observation groups, comparison to patient-defined ideal and satisfactory targets, comparison of static short form to computerised adaptive testing (CAT), comparison of self to proxy-rated scores, and comparison to other common PROMs.Methods and Procedures Forty-six PwPD (20 treatment/26 observation) completed data collection upon enrolment (pre-treatment) and 6 months later. In addition to the CPIB, PROMs included the Voice Handicap Index 10-item short form (VHI-10), PROMIS Global Health-Related Quality of Life, Levels of Speech Usage, self-rated speech severity, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Participants also engaged in qualitative interviews. Forty-four family members completed proxy CPIB ratings.Outcomes and Results There were no significant differences between treatment and observation groups on the CPIB pre-treatment, but there were significant differences post-treatment. The differences appeared to be largely due to significant gains in the treatment group. No participants reached their ideal CPIB target, and few reached their satisfactory target. Static CPIB short form and CAT scores were not significantly different, with an average of five CAT items administered per participant. Overall group similarities between patient and proxy scores may have obscured wide variability across individual patient-proxy pairs. Associations between CPIB and VHI-10, health-related quality of life, self-reported speech severity, and depression ranged from weak to moderate.Conclusions and Implications The CPIB appears to be sensitive to capturing change with intervention, and similar results are obtained with the static short form and CAT formats. One clinical caution is that even with gains observed in the treatment group, no participants obtained their ideal communicative participation goals, and few obtained a satisfactory level of communicative participation. Thus, while current interventions are beneficial, they may not meet the full range of clients' communication needs. While responding to the CPIB through a proxy rater may be feasible, caution is warranted due to concerns about maintaining the autonomy of PwPD.",0,0,communicative participation; dysarthria; Parkinson's disease; patient-reported outcomes; proxy; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SILVERMAN-VOICE-TREATMENT; PEOPLE; SELF; EXPERIENCES; CALIBRATION; VALIDATION; RATINGS,Article
Review article: Use of the Team Emergency Assessment Measure in the rating of emergency teams' non-technical skills: A mapping review,"Cooper, Simon; Connell, Clifford; Cant, Robyn; WILEY; Cooper, Simon; Cant, Robyn; Connell, Clifford; Cant, Robyn; Cant, Robyn; Connell, Clifford; Cant, Robyn; Connell, Clifford; Cooper, Simon",2023,EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA,10.1111/1742-6723.14184,WOS:000940259200001,Australia,"The present study aims to explore the utility of the Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM) in relation to the enhancement of emergency team non-technical skills based on research conducted over the last decade. In this mapping review, a citation mining process identified 22 primary studies for inclusion, published between 2012 and 2022. It provides outcome data on emergency teams' non-technical skills following team training and/or real-life patient emergencies. Emergency team studies related to resuscitation teams (adult, paediatric, newborn and obstetric cases) and medical emergency team (MET) management of patient deterioration. Team performance ratings varied, ranging from approximately 90% for experienced clinical teams down to 38% for students. Statistically significant improvements in performance were notable following training and/or repeated practice. Validity evidence, across 11 studies that provided change data described positive learning outcomes and moderate intervention effects. However, according to Kirkpatrick's model of educational evaluation the studies were limited to professional development phases of learning and immediate post-training assessments rather than care quality improvement. The review highlights a lack of studies evidencing quality improvement or clinical impact such as change of patient care practice or health service performance. There is a need to conduct well-designed studies that explore both technical and non-technical skills of resuscitation teams and METs. Currently, non-technical skills training and repeated performance evaluations using the TEAM contribute immensely to the proficiency of emergency teams.",0,0,continuing professional development; medical emergency team; non-technical skill; patient safety; training and assessment; PATIENT DETERIORATION; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION,Review
