Public and private healthcare services: What drives the choice?,"Meleddu, Marta; Pulina, Manuela; Scuderi, Raffaele; ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC; Meleddu, Marta; Pulina, Manuela; Scuderi, Raffaele; Pulina, Manuela; Meleddu, Marta; Meleddu, Marta",2020,SOCIO-ECONOMIC PLANNING SCIENCES,10.1016/j.seps.2019.100739,WOS:000532803100006,Italy,"This paper has explored patients' propensity to consume private healthcare services. We based our analysis on the typical tangible and intangible (for instance, responsiveness, reliability, assurance and staff empathy) domains of the SERVQUAL and SERVPERF methods. These variables may influence patients' decision-making when they choose between the public and private sectors. We combined factor analysis (to obtain a set of latent factors related to perceived quality) and a partial proportional ordered logit model to estimate the probability that a patient would access private healthcare services. To test the main hypotheses, we used data from a stratified sample in Sardinia, a peripheral region of Italy. Findings revealed that private and public healthcare are substitutes, especially for primary/specialised services. Patients who used public healthcare frequently and had a low income were unlikely to change to private healthcare or to recommend private services. 'Responsiveness' and perceptions on 'tangibles' were key in determining the probability that a patient would choose and recommend private services. This paper offers a multifaceted framework that can be used in future research to generalise these findings, especially in insular regions that are constrained by mobility.",0,0,Public healthcare; Private healthcare; Out-of-pocket spending; Quality; Factor analysis; Partial proportional ordered logit; PROPORTIONAL ODDS MODELS; WORD-OF-MOUTH; PATIENT SATISFACTION; QUALITY; HOSPITALS; PERCEPTIONS; SYSTEMS; DEMAND,Article

However, the screening participation rates of Chinese women remain low. Exploring the factors affecting breast cancer screening to promote cancer screening is necessary. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate women's satisfaction with healthcare providers and screening practices. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from November 2019 to April 2020 in Changchun, Jilin Province, China. The Medical Care Satisfaction Scale and SERVQUAL were used to quantify women's satisfaction with doctors and nurses, respectively. Results Women's satisfaction with doctors (68.81 +/- 11.08; range, 20-100) and with nurses (87.64 +/- 16.17; range, 22-110) was moderate. Compared with women who had not participated in screening within the past 2 years, screened women reported higher satisfaction with doctors (P = .026) and nurses (P = .012). Older age (P = .004) was an independent predictor of women's satisfaction with doctors. Similarly, women's education level (P = .049), chronic disease history (P = .029), and physical examination history (P = .039) were 3 independent predictors of women's satisfaction with nurses. Conclusions Future intervention strategies can not only increase the screening rates by providing existing intervention methods but also improve women's satisfaction with healthcare providers to promote screening practices. Implications for Practice This article provides a theoretical basis for healthcare providers to increase female screening practices. It also provides references for improving existing intervention methods.",0,0,Breast cancer screening; Breast neoplasms; Doctor; Healthcare provider; Nurse; Satisfaction; PATIENT SATISFACTION; BARRIERS,Article

Despite this objective, hospital inpatient case managers and the services they provide are evaluated routinely without including patients' perspectives. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to fill this research gap by using patient expectations and perceptions to assess the overall quality of and patient satisfaction with hospital case management services. Design/methodology/approach This paper investigates five dimensions of case management services - reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy and tangibles - and how they affect overall quality and patient satisfaction. Study surveys are based on the SERVQUAL instrument. Survey data from a cross-sectional sample of 67 inpatients are analyzed using principal component analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, GAP analysis and a predictive model. Findings The preliminary part of the study identifies ""tangibles"" and ""nontangibles"" - reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy - as the main components. Among these two components, only nontangibles have a positive and significant effect on both quality and patient satisfaction according to patient perspectives. GAP analysis indicates that gaps between patient expectations and perceptions of reliability and assurance are significant. Finally, the proposed predictive model reveals that gaps in assurance have a significant impact on both overall quality and satisfaction, while gaps in empathy have a significant impact on satisfaction, but not overall quality. Originality/value Studies on service quality at the case manager level are limited.

One of the most important challenges facing the healthcare sector worldwide concerns how to improve the overall quality of hospital care. As a result of the highly competitive nature of the economy in which healthcare services are offered, both public and private hospitals in Saudi Arabia must have their patient satisfaction rates assessed to help consumers make more informed decisions. As a result, we used the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model to ascertain how patients in Saudi Arabia perceive the quality of the service that is provided by hospitals. The objective of the research work is to identify criteria for enhancing healthcare services using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique to model the five SERVQUAL dimensions along with 2 dimensions and 31 sub-criteria. Three healthcare service organizations were selected for the study and evaluated based on their service quality performance. The AHP-based model has been demonstrated systematically for ranking the hospitals based on the healthcare system. It is observed that hospitals should concentrate the most on reliability, tangibles, and security and the least on consistency. In addition, according to the sub-criteria, the hospitals' primary priority should be infection prevention and hygiene, with completeness receiving the least attention. Based on a survey of dimensions and their sub-criteria, the best hospital is Abha Private Hospital, followed by AHH, and then Asir General Hospital. Therefore, this study has implications for choices on the efficient monitoring of the overall health system to improve quality service delivery that would boost patient happiness, which is the goal of creating hospitals.",12,0,analytic hierarchy process (AHP); healthcare services; ranking; SERVQUAL service quality; HOSPITAL-SERVICE; MODEL; SCALE,Article

The aim of this study is the assessment of key elements of service quality and their relationship with patients' satisfaction with receiving healthcare at public health institutions in Albania. The study examines five key dimensions of quality such as responsiveness, reliability, assurance, tangibles, and staff empathy to assess properly the healthcare quality and patient satisfaction in Albania based on the SERVQUAL instrument, which measures the differences between patient's perceptions of service quality received, and their expectations in terms of these five dimensions. A total of 800 randomly selected patients were interviewed in the main cities of Albania in public hospitals. A respective literature review was also a necessity to determine not only the appropriate methodology to be applied, together with the right quality dimensions to use but also for a better understanding of the link between service quality and patient satisfaction. The determination of the main quality factors which contribute to patient satisfaction, as well as, their order of importance, is another key aspect of the study, which finalizes with appropriate recommendations that might help quality improvement in future. The analysis shows that overall patient satisfaction is affected in public hospitals by all dimensions of service quality. Therefore, patients' perspective is extremely important in assessing healthcare service quality and should be taken into consideration by healthcare managers and policymakers in Albania, whenever significant reforms will be undertaken to improve the quality of services in this sector.",0,0,service quality; patient satisfaction; hospital health care; Albania; SERVQUAL; PRIVATE HEALTH-CARE; SERVICE QUALITY; PATIENTS-EXPECTATIONS; SECTOR,Article

A sample of 614 respondents was generated. Convenient sampling was employed to select patients of 20 public hospitals in Ghana. Structural equation modelling using smart partial least squares was used to test the nature of relationships of the constructs of the study. The study found a significant positive relationship between SQ and patient satisfaction. Also, the study found a significant positive relationship between customer satisfaction and BI and that patient satisfaction mediates the relationship between SQ and BI. The study provides a useful guide to strategy and policy formulation in the healthcare sector by exploring the potential viability of the SERVQUAL model as a relevant tool for initiating continuous service improvement in Ghana's public healthcare sector. The results also have practical application to managers of public healthcare institutions and governments in the formulation of public policy for the health sector.",0,0,behavioural intentions; customer satisfaction; Ghana; healthcare; service quality; INTERNAL MARKET ORIENTATION; HEALTH-CARE QUALITY; SATISFACTION; EXPECTATIONS; PERCEPTIONS; NECESSITY; MODELS; SCALE,Review

We use an approach that integrates the Fuzzy Set Theory and the quality tools QFD and SERVQUAL in the health services sector, reducing the subjectivity of the client's perception of the service provided. According to the results, the requirement with the highest priority was 'effectiveness'. So, managers need to give higher priority in terms of resources to try to take advantage of the customer's perception. The second high-priority requirement was 'acceptability'. In relation to this requirement, service managers must prioritize actions related to the care, desires and values of patients and their families. It is interesting to understand the 'equity' and 'efficiency' requirements. In this case, the company's managers must observe the priority level over those evaluated with the lowest rating and allocate the company's resources to the highest priority requirements. This approach seeks to contribute to the publication of academic studies in health services, assessing the quality of health services in a more complete and effective way.",0,0,Quality assessment; Service; Fuzzy; QFD; SERVQUAL Model; FUZZY TOPSIS; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; SATISFACTION; KNOWLEDGE; FQFD,Article
