The compassion levels of midwives working in the delivery room,"Ergin, Ayla; Ozcan, Muesser; Aksoy, Sena Dilek; SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD; Ergin, Ayla; Aksoy, Sena Dilek; Ozcan, Muesser; Ergin, Ayla; Ergin, Ayla; Ergin, Ayla; Aksoy, Sena Dilek",2020,NURSING ETHICS,10.1177/0969733019874495,WOS:000493881400001,Turkey,"Background: Compassion-based practices in midwifery are the most important expression of the depth of care quality. This concept is insufficiently represented in literature, therefore, studies on this subject are of utmost importance. Objectives: This study aims to determine the levels of compassion of midwives working in the delivery room and the factors affecting these levels. The study was carried out in Kocaeli, Turkey. Methods: This descriptive study was carried out from 1 February to 15 April 2019 in delivery rooms of six different hospitals located in the provincial centre of Kocaeli, Turkey, with 78 actively working midwives. Data were collected using a 'Compassion Scale' and analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis H test and the Spearman correlation test. Ethical considerations: This study was conducted according to ethical scientific guidelines. Results: The compassion score of the midwives were found to be 4.19 +/- 0.39. The total compassion score was affected by professional factors such as number of patients, alternating shift work, number of traumatic births and work satisfaction. While the kindness subscores decreased depending on shift work and number of traumatic births, it was determined that the midwives who were satisfied with their work had higher kindness scores than those who were not. Also, as the age and professional experience of the midwives and the number of traumatic births increased, their indifference score also increased. Midwives who reported that they were not satisfied with their job had higher scores regarding separation and disengagement scores than those who were satisfied with their job. Conclusion: It was determined that the compassion levels of midwives were found to be negatively affected by factors such as age, professional experience, job satisfaction and number of monthly traumatic births in a month. They should be reminded that compassionate midwifery care for women is a basic human right.",0,0,Compassion levels; midwives; ethics; professional factors; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; BURNOUT; EXPERIENCES; FATIGUE; STRESS; CARE,Article
A critical interpretive synthesis of informal payments in maternal health care,"Schaaf, Marta; Topp, Stephanie M.; OXFORD UNIV PRESS; Schaaf, Marta; Topp, Stephanie M.; Schaaf, Marta; Topp, Stephanie; Schaaf, Marta; Topp, Stephanie M; Schaaf, Marta",2019,HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING,10.1093/heapol/czz003,WOS:000469769700007,USA; Australia,"Informal payments for healthcare are widely acknowledged as undercutting health care access, but empirical research is somewhat limited. This article is a critical interpretive synthesis that summarizes the evidence base on the drivers and impact of informal payments in maternal health care and critically interrogates the paradigms that are used to describe informal payments. Studies and conceptual articles identified both proximate and systems drivers of informal payments. These include norms of gift giving, health workforce scarcity, inadequate health systems financing, the extent of formal user fees, structural adjustment and the marketization of health care, and patient willingness to pay for better care. Similarly, there are proximal and distal impacts, including on household finances, patient satisfaction and provider morale. Informal payments have been studied and addressed from a variety of different perspectives, including anti-corruption, ethnographic and other in-depth qualitative approaches and econometric modelling. Summarizing and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of these and other paradigms illustrates the value of an inter-disciplinary approach. The same tacit, hidden attributes that make informal payments hard to measure also make them hard to discuss and address. A multidisciplinary health systems approach that leverages and integrates positivist, interpretivist and constructivist tools of social science research can lead to better insight. With this, we can challenge master narratives' and meet universalistic, equity-oriented global health objectives.",6,0,Corruption; health policy; maternal health; health systems; OUT-OF-POCKET; USER FEES; SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY; PATIENT SATISFACTION; PUBLIC HOSPITALS; CORRUPTION; SERVICES; DELIVERY; QUALITY; TRUST,Review

Objective: The primary objective was to compare short-term seizure recurrence within 1 week in hospitalized children aged 1 month to 18 years with new-onset/breakthrough seizures after an early versus late switch-over from intravenous to the oral route of ASMs. Secondary objectives were to compare the incidence of status epilepticus, duration of hospital stay, drug acquisition costs, and caregiver-reported satisfaction scores in both groups. Methods: In this single-blind randomized controlled trial, patients with seizures were categorized based on the number of ASMs required and the history of status epilepticus. Patients in each category were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either early or late switch-over (ES or LS) groups. In the ES groups, ASMs were tapered one-by-one between 0 and 24 hours of seizure freedom, while in the LS groups, they were tapered one-by-one between 24 and 48 hours of seizure freedom. Results: A total of 112 children were enrolled in the study, with 56 in each arm. Seizure recurrence at 1 week and 12 weeks was comparable in ES and LS groups (3/55 vs. 1/54 at 1 week, p=0.61; 7/49 vs. 6/49 at 12 weeks, p=0.98). Drug acquisition costs were significantly lower in the ES group (393+274 vs. 658+568 INR, p=0.002). Thrombophlebitis and dysphoria were significantly more common in the LS group (p=0.008 and 0.03, respectively). Conclusion: The early switch-over of ASMs from intravenous to oral route is safe without any significant increased risk of short-term seizure recurrence and also associated with a reduction in the incidence of thrombophlebitis and ASM acquisition costs.

For this purpose, a total of 120 children with CEA were selected as study subjects who were admitted to our hospital (January 2017 to April 2020). They were randomly divided into the control group and observation group. Each group had 60 cases. The control group was given routine nursing, while the observation group adopted the integrated nursing model of medical care. The integrated nursing model had the characteristics of recognizing and managing the CEA quickly and efficiently. Thus, it can help increase the survival rate of infants. This model works along with the parents to provide specialized services to the child. They were tasked to carefully observe the infants as well as calm the parents. They were also given the additional task of keeping track of patients who were currently admitted in the hospital and those who were already discharged. The tracking and communication were done with the help of a communication platform which is WeChat. The rehospitalization rate, 1-hour visit rate, accuracy rate of children with suspected postoperative complications, psychological status of children's parents, medical compliance, and satisfaction were compared between the two groups. The rehospitalization rate in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The 1-hour visit rate and accuracy of children with suspected postoperative complications in the observation group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The anxiety and depression scores of the parents in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The compliance and satisfaction of parents in the observation group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The clinical effect of the integrated nursing model of medical care and patient in CEA was highly satisfactory. It reduces the rehospitalization rate and enables timely diagnosis and treatment of suspicious complications effectively.

Recently, the use of virtual reality in psychological assessment and treatment has given specialists a technology that appears particularly well-suited for addressing body image disorders. The study objectives were two-fold. Firstly, we aimed to evaluate changes within the body image of scoliosis patients pre- and postoperatively. Secondly, we aimed to investigate if differences in body image exist in scoliosis females after implementing cognitive-behavioral therapy. Methods: Thirty-six total scoliosis patients participated in the 1st and 2nd study phases. The psychotherapy took place before and after surgery and during the patient's stay in the hospital. Body image was assessed using a virtual reality-based application, ""Avatar Scoliosis 3D"". Results: Regarding body image dissatisfaction evaluated via virtual tasks, the difference between the desired by patients and actual (based on the radiographic parameters) body shape is significant preoperatively in both scoliosis samples: with and without therapy (p < 0.000001 and p < 0.000001, respectively). Conclusions: The results of the present study may have important implications for developing standards for body image disorder treatments in scoliosis patients. We revealed that irrespective of received therapeutic support, scoliosis patients accurately estimate their body shape pre- and postoperatively, and they feel dissatisfied with their body preoperatively but not postoperatively.",0,0,adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; virtual reality (VR); virtual mirror; cognitive-behavioral therapy; body image; POSTERIOR SPINAL-FUSION; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS; ANOREXIA-NERVOSA; PAIN MANAGEMENT; SIZE ESTIMATION; BRACE; PSYCHOTHERAPY; SATISFACTION; VALIDATION,Article

Sixty patients who underwent unilateral total knee arthroplasty and 60 patients who underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion between March and May 2022 were recruited as the control stage. Additionally, a total of 120 patients, 60 of each, who underwent the two procedures between September and November 2022, were recruited as the experimental stage. For the control stage, conventional external equipment management was used, and for the experimental stage, an external device management programme was implemented based on multidisciplinary collaboration with the control stage. Based on the PDSA cycle, the configuration management of orthopaedic external device sets was optimised, and the differences in collating and counting external devices, nurses' overtime in the external device stage and orthopaedic surgeon satisfaction were compared between the two stages.Results: Compared with the control stage, the collation count took less time (8.65 +/- 0.25 min vs 5.37 +/- 0.13 min; 13.55 +/- 1.10 min vs 7.85 +/- 0.82 min), the number of overtime hours was shorter (175.80 +/- 12.19 min vs 96.68 +/- 13.66 min) and orthopaedic surgeon satisfaction was improved (4.58 +/- 0.62 vs 4.10 +/- 0.68; 4.33 +/- 0.73 vs 3.87 +/- 0.77; 4.20 +/- 0.71 vs 3.82 +/- 0.71; 4.12 +/- 0.69 vs 3.87 +/- 0.72; 4.05 +/- 0.68 vs 3.79 +/- 0.68) in the experimental stage (all P < 0.05).Conclusion: Multidisciplinary collaboration offers various benefits for optimising the configuration of external device sets, such as reducing the time taken for the preoperative sorting and counting of external devices, enhancing nurses' work efficiency and improving surgeons' job satisfaction; therefore, it is worthy of reference in clinical practice.",0,0,operating theatre; optimisation configuration; external instruments; item counting; scientific management; work efficiency,Article

The care and treatment processes provided by this service have been appreciated by researchers as they can be less expensive and just as effective than care provided by a hospital or a skilled care facility. HHC gains importance due to the increasing epidemic disease cases, the increase in the elderly population, etc. In this study, it is aimed to provide high quality service as well as minimizing travel costs by considering the constraints related to travel balancing and type of transportation vehicle. So, environmental and economic factors could be included in the model. The proposed Home Health Care Routing Problem with Health Team Skill Level (HTSL-HHCRP) model was coded in GAMS 24.2.1 software. A new hybrid method named as Genetic Algorithm Simulated Annealing-Marine Pred-ators Algorithm (GASA-MPA) has been developed to solve the large dimensions of the problem. In hybrid approach, SA has been used with an initial point obtained by GA. On the other hand, feasibility of the neigh-borhood solutions is guaranteed by solving a constraint satisfaction problem via MPA. Test problems' perfor-mance was analyzed using the Relative Deviation Index (RDI) evaluation criteria. In addition, the sensitivity of the results according to some parameters selected by scenario analysis was examined. Results confirm the effi-ciency of the GASA-MPA algorithm in terms of time and objective function. Furthermore, by addressing skill levels of the healthcare team, it is shown that the proposed algorithm performs better than more traditional evolutionary algorithms in HHCRP. The comparisons show that the proposed method outperformed the classical methods not only in terms of best solution, but also the Gap (%) and RDI values.",0,0,Home health care services; Vehicle routing with time windows; Health team skill levels; GASA-MPA hybrid method; Constraint satisfaction problem; SCHEDULING PROBLEM; MEMETIC ALGORITHM; COLONY ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; ADDRESS; TRAVEL; TOOL,Article

Novel regional blocks may improve pain management for such patients and can shorten their length of stay in the hospital. To compare postoperative pain intensity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with either erector spinae plane (ESP) block or combined ESP and pectoralis nerve (PECS) blocks. Methods This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study done in a tertiary hospital. Thirty patients undergoing mitral/tricuspid valve repair via mini-thoracotomy were included. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two groups: ESP or PECS + ESP group (1:1 randomization). Patients in both groups received a single-shot, ultrasound-guided ESP block. Participants in PECS + ESP group received additional PECS blocks. Each patient had to be extubated within 2 h from the end of the surgery. Pain was treated via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump. The primary outcome was the total oxycodone consumption via PCA during the first postoperative day. The secondary outcomes included pain intensity measured on the visual analog scale (VAS), patient satisfaction, Prince Henry Hospital Pain Score (PHHPS), and spirometry. Results Patients in the PECS + ESP group used significantly less oxycodone than those in the ESP group: median 12 [interquartile range (IQR): 6-16] mg vs. 20 [IQR: 18-29] mg (p = 0.0004). Moreover, pain intensity was significantly lower in the PECS + ESP group at each of the five measurements during the first postoperative day. Patients in the PECS + ESP group were more satisfied with pain management. No difference was noticed between both groups in PHHPS and spirometry. Conclusions The addition of PECS blocks to ESP reduced consumption of oxycodone via PCA, reduced pain intensity on the VAS, and increased patient satisfaction with pain management in patients undergoing mitral/tricuspid valve repair via mini-thoracotomy.",1,0,Erector spinae plane (ESP) block; Pectoralis nerve (PECS) blocks; Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA); Visual analog scale (VAS); CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY; EPIDURAL ANALGESIA; MANAGEMENT; BENEFITS,Article

The debate over the most effective cervical ripening method persist, with a significant gap in research specifically addressing patient satisfaction. Our study aims to compare patient experience with two induction methods, slow-release intravaginal dinoprostone device and orally administered misoprostol. Method: We conducted a before-and-after comparative study at a university tertiary hospital, including all patients undergoing cervical ripening with a Bishop score of 3 or lower. Our study compared two separate twomonth periods, where the methods for cervical ripening differed. The first period employed an intravaginal dinoprostone slow-release device, while the second period used oral misoprostol. The primary outcome was patient experience, assessed using the EXIT questionnaire, a standardized and validated self-reported measure. Secondary outcomes were efficacy and safety outcomes. Results: A total of 165 patients were included, 81 induced with dinoprostone and 84 induced with misoprostol. The EXIT questionnaire completion rate was 67.9 % (n = 55) in the dinoprostone group and 76.1 % (n = 64) in the misoprostol group (p = 0.23). Patients induced with misoprostol reported higher levels of satisfaction compared to those induced with dinoprostone, which can be attributed to reduced discomfort associated with the induction process (mean satisfaction score 2.26 f 0.98 versus 2.80 f 0.85 on a 1 to 5 likert-scale, p-value < 0.01). Adverse effects were reported less frequently with misoprostol compared to dinoprostone (20.2 % vs 48.1 %, p-value < 0.01). Time between cervical ripening and delivery was shorter in the misoprostol group (27.0 f 10.2 h vs 32.5 f 10.0, p < 0.01). There were no difference in mode of delivery or other obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Conclusion: For women undergoing cervical ripening, oral misoprostol appears to be a less invasive method for labor induction, associated with higher levels of satisfaction and reduced discomfort compared to the intravaginal dinoprostone slow-release device.",0,0,Patient satisfaction; Experience; Prostglandin E; Induced labor; WOMENS EXPERIENCES; LABOR INDUCTION; DINOPROSTONE; METAANALYSIS; MISOPROSTOL; CATHETERS,Article

UK guidelines recommend regular follow-up because missed early failure can result in complex revision surgery, which places additional burden on overstretched orthopaedic services. This study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of an expert, consensus-based, standardised virtual clinic (VC) approach for TJA follow-up. Methods Five UK secondary care orthopaedic centres implemented a standardised VC. Feedback was obtained through patient satisfaction questionnaires and telephone interviews with arthroplasty care practitioners. Key stakeholders subsequently attended an expert discussion forum to achieve consensus on the final VC format and to address obstacles identified during testing. Results From 19 June 2018 to 11 December 2018, 561 TJA patients [mean age (SD) 70 (9.4) years, 57.8% female, 69.0% hip TJA, 1-28 years postsurgery (median 5 years)] completed a VC. Of these 561 patients, 82.2% were discharged without attending an outpatient appointment and 46 (8.8%) required early face-to-face consultant review. Patient satisfaction with the VC was high (156/188; 83.0%); over 70% of patients indicated a preference for the VC. Discussion This feasibility study suggested significant resource savings, including time spent by consultant orthopaedic surgeons in outpatient clinics, hospital transport and an estimated saving of up to two-thirds of usual clinic-allotted time. The expert discussion forum provided helpful feedback for supporting more efficient implementation of the VC. Conclusions A standardised VC is a feasible alternative to outpatient clinics for the follow-up of hip and knee TJA patients, and is acceptable to key stakeholders, including patients.",4,0,Virtual clinic; Arthroplasty; COST,Article

Shortening length of stay may reduce costs and improve patient satisfaction. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety of same-day discharge after appendectomy for acute appendicitis. Methods A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. A literature search of EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, and Google Scholar was conducted from inception to April 14, 2020. Two reviewers independently screened the literature and selected studies that addressed discharge on the same calendar day as the appendectomy. Risk of bias was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool. Main outcomes were hospital readmission, complications, and unplanned hospital visits in the postoperative course. A random effects model was used to pool risk ratios for the main outcomes. Results Of the 1912 articles screened, 17 comparative studies and 8 non-comparative studies met the inclusion criteria. Most only included laparoscopic procedure for uncomplicated appendicitis. Most studies were considered at moderate or serious risk of bias. In meta-analysis, same-day discharge (vs. overnight hospitalization) was not associated with increased rates of readmission, complication, and unplanned hospital visits. Non-comparative studies demonstrated low rates of readmission, complications, and unplanned hospital visits after same-day discharge. Conclusion This study suggests that same-day discharge after laparoscopic appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis is safe without an increased risk of readmission, complications, or unplanned hospital visits. Hence, same-day discharge may be further encouraged in selected patients.",0,0,Appendicitis; Appendectomy; Same-day discharge; Length of stay; Readmission; OUTPATIENT LAPAROSCOPIC APPENDECTOMY; UNCOMPLICATED ACUTE APPENDICITIS; SURGERY; MANAGEMENT; OUTCOMES; FEASIBILITY; EMERGENCIES; CHILDREN; PROTOCOL; SAVINGS,Review
