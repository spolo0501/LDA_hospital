However, measles and mumps' resurgence was recently reported, outbreaks still occur, and challenges remain to control these diseases. Areas covered: This qualitative narrative review provides an objective appraisal of the literature regarding current challenges in controlling measles, mumps, rubella infections, and interventions to address them. Expert opinion: While vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella (including trivalent vaccines) are widely used and effective, challenges to control these diseases are mainly related to insufficient immunization coverage and changing vaccination needs owing to new global environment (e.g. traveling, migration, population density). By understanding disease transmission peculiarities by setting, initiatives are needed to optimize vaccination policies and increase vaccination coverage, which was further negatively impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Also, awareness of the potential severity of infections and the role of vaccines should increase. Reminder systems, vaccination of disadvantaged, high-risk and difficult-to-reach populations, accessibility of vaccination, healthcare infrastructure, and vaccination services management should improve. Outbreak preparedness should be strengthened, including implementation of high-quality surveillance systems to monitor epidemiology. While the main focus should be on these public health initiatives to increase vaccination coverage, slightly more benefits could come from evolution of current vaccines.Plain Language SummaryWhat is the context? Measles, mumps, and rubella are highly contagious diseases associated with significant medical and societal burden. Effective vaccines against these diseases are available, and the implementation of vaccination programs drastically reduced disease incidence globally. However, reports of measles and mumps outbreaks in the last few years highlight remaining challenges to eliminate these diseases.What does the review highlight? We conducted a literature review to identify challenges associated with controlling measles, mumps, and rubella infections, and interventions needed to address them. We identified 11 challenges mainly related to low immunization coverage and vaccine characteristics. Societal challenges could be addressed by increasing awareness of disease severity and vaccines impact, targeting high-risk, unvaccinated, and under-vaccinated populations, improving vaccination access, setting up clear outbreak preparedness plans, and implementing country-specific vaccination policies. System weaknesses could be addressed through improving vaccination services and health infrastructure, implementing high-quality surveillance, patient invite, and reminder systems, ensuring vaccine implementation and long-term supply. Interventions related to vaccine characteristic challenges could include adaptation of vaccination schedules (shorter interval between doses, administration of a third dose) and development of vaccines against emerging strains.",0,0,Coverage; elimination; measles; MMR vaccine; MMR uptake; mumps; prevention; protection; rubella; vaccine effectiveness; HEALTH-CARE WORKERS; SUPPLEMENTARY IMMUNIZATION ACTIVITIES; VACCINE HESITANCY; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; MMR VACCINE; GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE; HUMORAL IMMUNITY; UNITED-STATES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; OUTBREAK,Review
A Mixed Methods Evaluation of a Pilot Multidisciplinary Breathlessness Support Service,"Drury, Amanda; Goss, Julie; Afolabi, Jide; McHugh, Gillian; O'Leary, Norma; Brady, Anne-Marie; SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC; Drury, Amanda; Drury, Amanda; Goss, Julie; Afolabi, Jide; McHugh, Gillian; O'Leary, Norma; Brady, Anne-Marie; Drury, Amanda; Drury, Amanda; Brady, Anne-Marie; Drury, Amanda; Drury, Amanda",2023,EVALUATION REVIEW,10.1177/0193841X231162402,WOS:000962653400001,Ireland,"Breathlessness support services have demonstrated benefits for breathlessness mastery, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes for people living with breathlessness. However, these services have predominantly been implemented in hospital and home care contexts. This study aims to evaluate the adaptation and implementation of a hospice-based outpatient Multidisciplinary Breathlessness Support Service (MBSS) in Ireland. A sequential explanatory mixed methods design guided this study. People with chronic breathlessness participated in longitudinal questionnaires (n = 10), medical record audit (n = 14) and a post-discharge interview (n = 8). Caregivers (n = 1) and healthcare professionals involved in referral to (n = 2) and delivery of (n = 3) the MBSS participated in a cross-sectional interview. Quantitative and qualitative data were integrated deductively via the pillar integration process, guided by the RE-AIM framework. Integration of mixed methods data enhanced understanding of factors influencing the reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance of the MBSS, and the potential outcomes that were most meaningful for service users. Potential threats to the sustainability of the MBSS related to potential preconceptions of hospice care, the lack of standardized discharge pathways from the service and access to primary care services to sustain pharmacological interventions. This study suggests that an adapted multidisciplinary breathlessness support intervention is feasible and acceptable in a hospice context. However, to ensure optimal reach and maintenance of the intervention, activities are required to ensure that misconceptions about the setting do not influence willingness to accept referral to MBSS services and integration of services is needed to enable consistency in referral and discharge processes.",0,0,dyspnea; integration; joint displays; mixed methods; pillar integration process; palliative care; OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; PALLIATIVE CARE; SELF-EFFICACY; REFRACTORY BREATHLESSNESS; COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; DOCTORS ATTITUDES; SYMPTOM CLUSTER; CANCER PATIENTS; LUNG-CANCER,Article

While espousing these Mobile Medical Information Systems, sequestration and security issues arise. Due to advanced computing and different capabilities, data security and confidentiality come major enterprises with continuously expanding mHealth operations. European Union General Data Protection (GDPR) and California Consumer Sequestration Act (CCPA) raise mindfulness; still, they need to address developing a system that meets sequestration and security conditions. This paper deals with research literature to understand current privacy and security issues and possible solutions for patients and providers using mHealth applications. This is the reason for several threats, such as information harvesting, tracking patients, relaying attacks, and denial of service attacks, which affect the confidentiality and integrity of these devices. We discussed the challenges and risks associated with Mobile Medical information systems and emphasized the need to address these concerns for widespread adoption. Mitigation strategies include robust security measures, regulatory compliance, and user awareness. We discussed the impact of privacy and security issues on healthcare, including potential harm to patients and disruptions in system functioning, reviewing laws, conducting a literature review, and assessing mHealth system applications. We emphasize the need for comprehensive security measures and continuous evaluation of security practices in mHealth, which need to be addressed to achieve quality, continuity, and portability of health services.

Quality improvement studies are needed to assess the representativeness of PRO data collected in routine care, identify the underlying causes of non-response and develop novel methods to ensure data representativeness. Using a multilevel framework and a mixed-methods approach, we have three aims: (1) characterise the non-response of the Global-10 across clinic, provider and patient levels; (2) identify multilevel causes of non-response and potential strategies to improve representativeness in PRO collection; and (3) develop effective modifications to missing-data methods to enhance the representativeness of pre-existing PRO data. Methods and analysis Our primary data source is the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global-10, collected as part of routine care at the Radiation Oncology clinics within the Mass General Brigham (MGB) healthcare system. Other sources include (1) Harvard Catalyst for provider-specific data, (2) MGB administrative data, (3) public Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data and (4) the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System. We will conduct quantitative analyses to assess variations in Global-10 non-response across multilevel factors. Additionally, we will use qualitative interviews with patients and clinical professionals to understand the causes of non-response and to formulate strategies to expand the reach of PRO collection to underrepresented cancer patients, improve their completions and enhance overall data representativeness. Finally, we will integrate implementation science knowledge and findings from the first two aims into missing-data methods to manage non-response in the pre-existing Global-10 data and to evaluate their performance in preserving representativeness.

Readiness, denoting stages of behavior change, exerts a substantial influence on its uptake. However, the characteristics and impacts of advance care planning interventions on readiness are not well-established. Method: We systematically reviewed and conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of advance care planning interventions on readiness. Studies were appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools. Meta-analyses were performed using mean difference of continuous variables or risk ratios of binary variables and their 95 % confidence interval as the pooled effect sizes. Results: Eight studies were included in this review and were all rated low quality. Meta-analysis showed that interventions resulted in slight improvement in overall readiness (mean difference = 0.19, 95 % confidence interval: 0.02-0.36) for advance care planning. However, statistically significant effects of interventions were not identified for readiness in relation to specific behaviors (appointment of a healthcare proxy, talking to a healthcare proxy, talking to a medical practitioner about living wills, and signing a living will). Conclusion: Our meta-analyses demonstrated that interventions can improve the overall readiness for advance care planning, suggesting the necessity to integrate readiness into future health policies and clinical practices. Nevertheless, the absence of significant effects on specific behavioral readiness underscores the requirement for additional refinement in intervention design, advanced technologies, and theoretical foundations.

The care and treatment processes provided by this service have been appreciated by researchers as they can be less expensive and just as effective than care provided by a hospital or a skilled care facility. HHC gains importance due to the increasing epidemic disease cases, the increase in the elderly population, etc. In this study, it is aimed to provide high quality service as well as minimizing travel costs by considering the constraints related to travel balancing and type of transportation vehicle. So, environmental and economic factors could be included in the model. The proposed Home Health Care Routing Problem with Health Team Skill Level (HTSL-HHCRP) model was coded in GAMS 24.2.1 software. A new hybrid method named as Genetic Algorithm Simulated Annealing-Marine Pred-ators Algorithm (GASA-MPA) has been developed to solve the large dimensions of the problem. In hybrid approach, SA has been used with an initial point obtained by GA. On the other hand, feasibility of the neigh-borhood solutions is guaranteed by solving a constraint satisfaction problem via MPA. Test problems' perfor-mance was analyzed using the Relative Deviation Index (RDI) evaluation criteria. In addition, the sensitivity of the results according to some parameters selected by scenario analysis was examined. Results confirm the effi-ciency of the GASA-MPA algorithm in terms of time and objective function. Furthermore, by addressing skill levels of the healthcare team, it is shown that the proposed algorithm performs better than more traditional evolutionary algorithms in HHCRP.

The current analysis utilizes a linkage between a statewide stroke registry and EMS information system data to explore patient and EMS agency-level contributions to variability in prehospital care. Methods and ResultsThis is a retrospective analysis of a cohort of confirmed stroke cases transported by EMS to hospitals participating in a statewide stroke registry. Using EMS information system data, the authors quantified EMS compliance with 6 performance measures derived from national guidelines for prehospital stroke care: prehospital stroke scale performance, glucose check, stroke recognition, on-scene time <= 15 minutes, time last known well documentation, and hospital prenotification. Multilevel multivariable logistic regression analysis was then used to examine associations between patient-level demographic and clinical characteristics and EMS compliance while accounting for and quantifying the variation attributable to agency of transport and recipient hospital.Over an 18-month period, EMS and stroke registry records were linked for 5707 EMS-transported stroke cases. Compliance ranged from 24% of cases for last known well documentation to 82% for documentation of a glucose check. The other measures were documented in approximately half of cases. Older age, higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and earlier presentation were associated with more compliant prehospital care.

Hybridizing adaptive large neighborhood search with kernel search: a new solution approach for the nurse routing problem with incompatible services and minimum demand,"Gobbi, Alessandro; Manerba, Daniele; Mansini, Renata; Zanotti, Roberto; WILEY; Gobbi, Alessandro; Manerba, Daniele; Mansini, Renata; Zanotti, Roberto; Gobbi, Alessandro; Mansini, Renata; Manerba, Daniele; Manerba, Daniele; Zanotti, Roberto; Mansini, Renata",2023,INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS IN OPERATIONAL RESEARCH,10.1111/itor.13127,WOS:000761622100001,Italy,"The average age of the population has grown steadily in recent decades along with the number of people suffering from chronic diseases and asking for treatments. Hospital care is expensive and often unsafe, especially for older individuals. This is particularly true during pandemics as the recent SARS-CoV-2. Hospitalization at home has become a valuable alternative to face efficiently a huge increase in treatment requests while guaranteeing a high quality of service and lower risk to fragile patients. This new model of care requires the redefinition of health services organization and the optimization of scarce resources (e.g., available nurses). In this paper, we study a Nurse Routing Problem that tries to find a good balance between hospital costs reduction and the well-being of patients, also considering realistic operational restrictions like maximum working times for the nurses and possible incompatibilities between services jointly provided to the same patient. We first propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation for the problem and use some valid inequalities to strengthen it. A simple branch-and-cut algorithm is proposed and validated to derive ground benchmarks. In addition, to efficiently solve the problem, we develop an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search hybridized with a Kernel Search and validate its performance over a large set of different realistic working scenarios. Computational tests show how our matheuristic approach manages to find good solutions in a reasonable amount of time even in the most difficult settings. Finally, some interesting managerial insights are discussed through an economic analysis of the operating context.",0,0,home healthcare; nurse routing problem; incompatible services; ALNS; kernel search; HOME-HEALTH-CARE; TRAVELING PURCHASER PROBLEM; SCHEDULING PROBLEM; CUT ALGORITHM; CONSTRAINTS; PATIENT; COSTS; TIMES,Article
Efficient QoS processing for internet of medical things using non-cooperative game theory: resource allocation in cloud framework,"Xu, Zongpeng; Ban, Fuyu; Fotia, Pasquale; SPRINGER; Xu, Zongpeng; Xu, Zongpeng; Ban, Fuyu; Fotia, Pasquale; Xu, Zongpeng; Xu, Zongpeng",2024,ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH,10.1007/s10479-024-05857-1,WOS:001170385100004,Peoples R China; Malaysia,"The internet of medical things (IoMT) has transformed healthcare by improving data collection and management, particularly in critical care. Because IoMT systems deal with massive amounts of data, such as high-resolution photos and real-time vitals, network efficiency is critical. This research presents a cloud-based solution for IoMT data influx, leveraging a deep learning model designed for rapid and precise node identification within the network, which is critical for avoiding congestion and increasing data throughput. The primary goal of the model, which was created using a lightweight deep learning approach, is to efficiently identify nodes in a network. The model aims to quickly and accurately recognize and classify nodes by leveraging deep learning algorithms that are computationally less intensive. A subgame perfect equilibrium, specifically the Nash equilibrium, is sought to identify optimal solutions. By achieving stability, the allocation of resources becomes stable, and no participant has an incentive to deviate from their strategy unilaterally. Quality of service (QoS) is vital in medical data processing. Therefore, a utility function is defined based on the nature of tasks, considering factors such as task size and priority. The utility function captures the preferences and requirements of each task and guides the resource allocation decisions to optimise QoS. The research focuses on medical data processing, where every task is crucial and must be processed on time to provide optimal service. The research includes performance evaluations to demonstrate the proposed model's significance. Key metrics such as average processing delay, energy consumption, and network utility are measured and analysed. These evaluations highlight the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed resource allocation model based on non-cooperative game theory. The results emphasise the improvements in data processing efficiency, energy optimisation, and network utilisation within IoMT systems.",0,0,Non-cooperative game theory; Health monitoring; QoS; Internet of medical things; Resource allocation; Cloud; HEALTH-CARE,Article

Progress in evaluating the burden and aetiology of avoidable harm in prisons is limited compared with other healthcare sectors. To address this gap, this study aimed to develop a definition of avoidable harm to facilitate future epidemiological studies in prisons. MethodsUsing a sequential mixed methods study design we first characterised and reached consensus on the types and avoidability of patient harm in prison healthcare involving analysis of 151 serious prison incidents reported to the Strategic Executive Information System (StEIS) followed by in-depth nominal group (NG) discussions with four former service users and four prison professionals. Findings of the NG discussions and StEIS analysis were then synthesised and discussed among the research team and study oversight groups to develop an operational definition of avoidable harm in prison healthcare which was subsequently tested and validated using prison patient safety incident report data derived from the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS). ResultsAnalysis of StEIS incident reports and NG discussions identified important factors influencing avoidable harm which reflected the unique prison setting, including health care delivery issues and constraints associated with the secure environment which limited access to care. These findings informed the development of a new working two-tier definition of avoidable harm using appropriate and timely intervention, which included an additional assessment of harm avoidability taking into the account the prison regime and environment. The definition was compatible with the NRLS incident report narratives and illustrated how the prison environment may influence identification of avoidable harm and judgements of avoidability. ConclusionsWe have developed a working definition of avoidable harm in prison health care that enables consideration of caveats associated with prison environments and systems. Our definition enables future studies of the safety of prison healthcare to standardise outcome measurement.",0,0,GENERAL-PRACTICE; NOMINAL GROUP; SAFETY; QUALITY; INDICATORS; INCIDENTS; DELPHI,Article

These services have been provided in Primary Healthcare Centers, Community Pharmacies, and licensed ""Patent Medicine Stores"" that serve the least affluent communities. To support quality assurance, we applied an adapted version of SPI-RT (Stepwise Process for Improving the Quality of HIV Rapid and Recency Testing) to sites providing COVID-19-RDTs in Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria.Methods Between September 2022 and February 2023 community healthcare facilities (48 Community Pharmacies, 21 Patent Medicine Stores, 79 Primary Health Centers) were evaluated using Stepwise Process for Improving the Quality of SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Diagnostic Testing (SPI-RT) Checklist, tailored to the local implementation context. Evaluated domains included service quality, documents and records, personnel training and certification, safety, physical infrastructure, pre-testing phase, testing phase, and post-testing phase. Each facility received an overall score, expressed as a percentage indicating their performance level.Results 41/79 (52%) of Primary Health Centers scored at least 90% for service quality, as did 19/48 (40%) of pharmacies, with only 1/21 (4.8%) Patent Medicine Store. Apart from personnel training and certification, Primary Health Centers scored highest across most domains of service quality, followed by Community Pharmacies. The lowest median score in any domain was in the Patent Medicine Stores on testing and safety at 60% for both post-testing phase and safety.Conclusion Primary Healthcare Centers and Community Pharmacies can provide quality decentralized testing for COVID-19.

In the healthcare industry, Internet of Things (IoT) driven fog computing is being developed to speed up the services for the general public and save billions of lives. This new computing platform, based on the fog computing paradigm, may reduce latency when transmitting and communicating signals with faraway servers, allowing medical services to be delivered more quickly in both spatial and temporal dimensions. One of the necessary qualities of computing systems that can enable the completion of healthcare operations is latency reduction. Fog computing can provide reduced latency when compared to cloud computing due to the use of only low-end computers, mobile phones, and personal devices in fog computing. In this paper, a new framework for healthcare monitoring for managing real-time notification based on fog computing has been proposed. The proposed system monitors the patient's body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure values obtained from the sensors that are embedded into a wearable device and notifies the doctors or caregivers in real time if there occur any contradictions in the normal threshold value using the machine learning algorithms. The notification can also be set for the patients to alert them about the periodical medications or diet to be maintained by the patients. The cloud layer stores the big data into the cloud for future references for the hospitals and the researchers.",0,0,,Article

""Shared care,"" delivered by both oncologists and primary care providers (PCPs), may better address these needs. Little information is available on differences in outcomes among survivors receiving shared care versus oncologist-led or PCP-led care. This study compared experiences of care for survivors receiving shared care, oncologist-led, PCP-led, or other care patterns. Methods We used SEER-CAHPS data, including NCI's SEER registry data, Medicare claims, and Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey responses. Medicare Fee-for-Service beneficiaries age >= 65 years in SEER-CAHPS with breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, renal, or prostate cancers or hematologic malignancies who responded to a Medicare CAHPS survey >= 18 months post-diagnosis were included. CAHPS measures included ratings of overall care, personal doctor, specialist physician, health plan, prescription drug plan, and five composite scores. Survivorship care patterns were identified using proportions of oncologist, PCP, and other physician encounters. Multivariable regressions examined associations between care patterns and CAHPS outcomes. Results Among 10,132 survivors, 15% received shared care, 10% oncologist-led, 33% PCP-led, and 42% other. Compared with shared care, we found no significant differences in experiences of care except for getting needed drugs (lower scores for PCP-led and other care patterns). Sensitivity analyses using different patterns of care definitions similarly showed no associations between survivorship care pattern and experience of care. Conclusions Within the limitations of the study dataset, survivors age 65+ receiving shared care reported similar experiences of care to those receiving oncologist-led, PCP-led, and other patterns of care. Implications for Cancer Survivors Shared care may not provide survivor-perceived benefits compared with other care patterns.",0,0,Survivorship; Oncology; Physician practice patterns; Patient satisfaction; Claims analyses; SEER program; FOLLOW-UP CARE; QUALITY-OF-CARE; PREVENTIVE CARE; BREAST; PROSTATE; PROVIDERS; PHYSICIANS,Article

Objectives The aim of the study was to explore former patients' and family members' views and experiences of involvement in critical care research and/or quality improvement. Methods Using a qualitative methodology, semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with seven former intensive care unit patients and three close family members across England. Data were analyzed using a standard process of inductive thematic analysis. Results Four key themes were identified: making it happen, overcoming hurdles, it helps, and respect and value. Findings center on the need for flexibility, inclusivity, and transparency. They further highlight the particular challenges faced by critical illness survivors and their family members in relation to research involvement, the importance of individualized support and training, and the vital role that project leads have in making people feel valued and equal partners in the process. Discussion This is the first study to explore patients' experiences of involvement in critical care research. Despite the small, homogenous sample, the study provides valuable and important data to guide future practice. It highlights the need to enable and support people to make informed choices at a time when they are ready to do so. It further highlights the importance of gatekeepers to avoid vulnerable people contributing before they are ready-a practice that could negatively affect their health status.",0,0,critical care; patient participation; qualitative research; PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT; HEALTH-CARE; IMPACT,Article

Integrated palliative care aims to achieve care continuity by integrating organisational, administrative and clinical services involved in patient care networks. However, integrated palliative care for cancer is not common practice. This project, therefore, aims to understand how integrated palliative care and cancer care works in different healthcare settings (inpatient/outpatient), and for which groups of people (at what stage of the cancer journey), so we can develop guidance for optimal delivery. Methods and analysis We will conduct a realist synthesis to develop a programme theory of how integrated palliative care in cancer works, for whom and in what contexts to achieve improved symptom management and quality of life for patients and their families. This realist synthesis will follow the five stages outlined by Pawson: (1) locating existing theories, (2) searching for evidence, (3) article selection, (4) extracting and organising data and (5) synthesising the evidence and drawing conclusions. We will work closely with our expert stakeholder group, which includes health and social care professionals providing palliative care and oncology; management and policy groups and members of the public and patients. We will adhere to RAMESES quality standards for undertaking a realist synthesis. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval for this project is not required. The realist synthesis will develop a programme theory that provides clarity on the optimal delivery of palliative care for adults with cancer. We will use the programme theory to coproduce guidance and user-friendly outputs, working with stakeholders to inform delivery of best practice. Findings will inform further research in integrated palliative care and cancer. Stakeholder engagement will assist in the dissemination of our findings.",0,0,PALLIATIVE CARE; ONCOLOGY; HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION & MANAGEMENT; ADVANCED CANCER; OUTCOMES,Article
