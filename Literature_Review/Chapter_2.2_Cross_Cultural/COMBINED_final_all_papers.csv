The challenge of cultural competence in the workplace: perspectives of healthcare providers,"Shepherd, Stephane M.; Willis-Esqueda, Cynthia; Newton, Danielle; Sivasubramaniam, Diane; Paradies, Yin; BMC; Shepherd, Stephane M.; Willis-Esqueda, Cynthia; Newton, Danielle; Sivasubramaniam, Diane; Paradies, Yin; Shepherd, Stephane M.; Sivasubramaniam, Diane; Newton, Danielle; Shepherd, Stephane",2019,BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH,10.1186/s12913-019-3959-7,WOS:000459867000002,Australia; USA,"BackgroundCross-cultural educational initiatives for professionals are now commonplace across a variety of sectors including health care. A growing number of studies have attempted to explore the utility of such initiatives on workplace behaviors and client outcomes. Yet few studies have explored how professionals perceive cross-cultural educational models (e.g., cultural awareness, cultural competence) and the extent to which they (and their organizations) execute the principles in practice. In response, this study aimed to explore the general perspectives of health care professionals on culturally competent care, their experiences working with multi-cultural patients, their own levels of cultural competence and the extent to which they believe their workplaces address cross-cultural challenges.MethodsThe perspectives and experiences of a sample of 56 health care professionals across several health care systems from a Mid-Western state in the United States were sourced via a 19-item questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised both open-ended questions and multiple choice items. Percentages across participant responses were calculated for multiple choice items. A thematic analysis of open-ended responses was undertaken to identify dominant themes.ResultsParticipants largely expressed confidence in their ability to meet the needs of multi-cultural clientele despite almost half the sample not having undergone formal cross-cultural training. The majority of the sample appeared to view cross-cultural education from a cultural awareness' perspective - effective cross-cultural care was often defined in terms of possessing useful cultural knowledge (e.g., norms and customs) and facilitating communication (the use of interpreters); in other words, from an immediate practical standpoint. The principles of systemic cross-cultural approaches (e.g., cultural competence, cultural safety) such as a recognition of racism, power imbalances, entrenched majority culture biases and the need for self-reflexivity (awareness of one's own prejudices) were scarcely acknowledged by study participants.ConclusionsFindings indicate a need for interventions that acknowledge the value of cultural awareness-based approaches, while also exploring the utility of more comprehensive cultural competence and safety approaches.",32,0,Cultural competence; Cultural safety; Cultural humility; Diversity training; Public health; PATIENT PERCEPTIONS; PHYSICIAN; INTERVENTIONS; COMMUNICATION; FORMULATION; DISPARITIES; OUTCOMES; WORKERS; REDUCE; SAFETY,Article
South Asian patients' perceptions and experiences of compassion in healthcare,"Singh, Pavneet; King-Shier, Kathryn; Sinclair, Shane; ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD; Singh, Pavneet; King-Shier, Kathryn; Sinclair, Shane; Singh, Pavneet; Sinclair, Shane; King-Shier, Kathryn; Sinclair, Shane; Sinclair, Shane; Sinclair, Shane",2020,ETHNICITY & HEALTH,10.1080/13557858.2020.1722068,WOS:000513463600001,Canada,"Background: South Asians are one of the fastest growing ethnic populations in Western countries. Accordingly, providing culturally sensitive healthcare to South Asians is becoming increasingly important. Compassion is a key component of quality healthcare and is central to bridging ethnic and cultural differences between patients and their healthcare providers (HCP). Objective: We aimed to identify and describe the perspectives, experiences, importance, and impact of compassion among South Asian patients. Methods: Straussian grounded theory was used to examine the perspectives of South Asians patients who had recent experience(s) with the Canadian healthcare system. A convenience sample of 19 South Asian participants underwent semi-structured audio-recorded interviews in either English, Hindi, or Punjabi. Transcribed interview data were analyzed using constant comparison. Results: Three categories were generated from the data: (1) South Asians' understandings of compassion, (2) HCPs' cultural sensitivity as an indicator of compassion, and (3) enhancing compassion: importance and patient recommendations for overcoming barriers to compassion. The first category included themes exploring South Asian patients' perspectives of compassion. The second category was divided into themes which examined how delivery and receipt of compassion can be influenced by ethnic and cultural differences between patients and HCPs. The third category consisted of themes highlighting participants' views on the importance of compassion, recommendations for overcoming language and cultural barriers to providing compassion, and the role of compassion in bridging language, culture and ethnic differences between patients and HCPs. Conclusion: Compassion was described as a universal concept that is interpreted through the cultural and ethnic background of the recipient and provider in the way it is perceived, enacted, and received. This information can aid HCP to modulate compassion to South Asian patients and may provide a foundation for future studies on compassion within other cultural groups.",15,0,South Asians; culturally-sensitive care; compassion; compassionate care; PALLIATIVE CARE; NURSING-CARE; OF-LIFE; SATISFACTION; SIMILARITIES; PERSPECTIVE; RECIPROCITY; BARRIERS; CULTURES; DIGNITY,Article

They use, among others, emergency medical services provided by healthcare professionals: doctors, nurses, and paramedics. Skillful care for culturally different patients requires cultural competencies and cultural intelligence to ensure good quality of care and cultural safety. The study aimed to measure and assess the cultural competencies and cultural intelligence of medical professionals working in hospital emergency departments (HEDs) and hospital emergency rooms (HERs) in Malopolska, a region in southern Poland. Methods: The following questionnaires were used in the study: the Cross-Cultural Competence Inventory (CCCI), the Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS), and Questionnaire on Attitudes Towards Culturally Divergent People. In total, 709 medical professionals participated in the study, including 363 nurses, 223 paramedics, and 123 doctors. Results: Cultural intelligence-the overall score and the scores on the metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and behavioral subscales were significantly higher among HED and HER doctors. Cultural competencies-the overall score and the score on the cultural adaptation subscale were also significantly higher among HED and HER doctors. The CCCI and CQS scores were influenced by selected variables: taking care of and close interactions with representatives of other cultural circles; staying outside Poland for more than a month. Doctors were the group of medical professionals that were most tolerant and most positive towards people from other cultures. Conclusions: The research results confirm the positive impact of contact of medical professionals with people from other cultures on their cultural competencies and cultural intelligence. They indicate the need for training in acquiring cultural competencies and developing cultural intelligence, especially among nurses. They demonstrate the need to raise awareness among HED and HER medical professionals about issues in intercultural care and to increase diversity efforts, especially among nurses.",13,0,healthcare providers/healthcare professionals; emergency medical system; cultural competence; cultural intelligence; MODEL,Article

Recent Findings Bacterial infections and sepsis are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in patients admitted to the intensive care unit and their management is further complicated by the increase in the global burden of antimicrobial resistance. In this setting, new diagnostic methods able to overcome the limits of traditional microbiology in terms of turn-around time and accuracy are highly warranted. We discuss the following broad themes: optimisation of existing culture-based methodologies, rapid antigen detection, nucleic acid detection (including multiplex PCR assays and microarrays), sepsis biomarkers, novel methods of pathogen detection (e.g. T2 magnetic resonance) and susceptibility testing (e.g. morphokinetic cellular analysis) and the application of direct metagenomics on clinical samples. The assessment of the host response through new ""omics"" technologies might also aid in early diagnosis of infections, as well as define non-infectious inflammatory states. Despite being a promising field, there is still scarce evidence about the real-life impact of these assays on patient management. A common finding of available studies is that the performance of rapid diagnostic strategies highly depends on whether they are integrated within active antimicrobial stewardship programs. Assessing the impact of these emerging diagnostic methods through patient-centred clinical outcomes is a complex challenge for which large and well-designed studies are awaited.",4,0,Rapid diagnostics; Bloodstream infection; Sepsis; Antimicrobial resistance; Critical care; BLOOD-STREAM INFECTIONS; RAPID IDENTIFICATION; BACT/ALERT VIRTUO; ACCELERATE PHENO; CULTURE-SYSTEMS; PATHOGEN IDENTIFICATION; STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS; CLINICAL IMPACT; PNA-FISH; TIME,Review

While researchers in the field have mainly focused on the role of technology, the role of a country's cultural dimensions as antecedents of dynamic capabilities responsible for driving the digitalisation of the healthcare services is largely under-researched. Consequently, we aim to investigate the role of country's cultural dimensions and dynamic capabilities in the value-based performance of digital healthcare services. The study rests on multiple-case-study design, which was applied to examine the interlinkages between the cultural dimensions, dynamic capabilities and the value-based performance of digital healthcare services across Lithuania, the United States and Spain. Information was gathered through conducting 66 interviews with healthcare ecosystem stakeholders. The study results show that the low-scoring cultural dimensions of power distance, uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation and high-scoring dimensions of individualism, masculinity and indulgence are antecedents of strong dynamic capabilities, specifically with regards to strong environment scanning, employee engagement and organisational learning. Furthermore, strong dynamic capabilities were found to be associated with a more advanced implementation of digital healthcare services.",2,0,dynamic capabilities; Hofstede cultural dimensions; digital healthcare services; value-based performance; multiple case study; NATIONAL CULTURE; QUADRUPLE AIM; IMPACT; INSTITUTIONS; INNOVATION; STRATEGY; ISSUES,Article

Less is known about long-term outcomes. Purpose: To report outcomes 10 years after hip arthroscopy for FAIS in high-level athletes using validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients who underwent hip arthroscopy between November 2011 and January 2013 were included in a local hip arthroscopy registry and completed preoperative PROMs. At 10-year follow-up, the same PROMs were completed. Inclusion criteria were age <40 years at time of surgery, no prior hip surgeries, and a pre-symptomatic Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS) level of 7 or 8. The exclusion criterion was total hip arthroplasty at follow-up. The PROMs included the international Hip Outcome Tool-12 items (iHOT-12), the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for overall hip function, European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) and European Quality of Life-visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), HSAS, and a single question on patient satisfaction. The rates of patients achieving minimal important change and reporting Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) were reported for HAGOS and iHOT-12. For iHOT-12, preoperative results were compared with 1, 5, and 10-year follow-ups. Results: A total of 45 patients (34 men, 11 women; 70 hips; mean age 24.4 years at time of surgery) were included, with 77 patients eligible for inclusion. Significant improvements (P < .001) were seen at 10-year follow-up in all HAGOS subscales: Symptoms, Pain, Daily Activity, Sports, Physical Activity, Quality of Life (50.3 vs 78.6, 59.2 vs 86.8, 65.9 vs 88.8, 37.1 vs 81.1, 24.4 vs 81.1, 32.1 vs 79.3), iHOT-12 (40.1 vs 81.6), EQ-5D (0.59 vs 0.89), EQ-VAS (65.6 vs 80.4), and VAS for overall hip function (48 vs 79). For iHOT-12, the largest change was seen between preoperative and 1-year follow-up values, with consistent results over time. There was no statistically significant difference between HSAS levels preoperatively and at 10-year follow-up (HSAS level 4), with 24% of patients reporting a HSAS level 7 or 8 at the follow-up. Of the patients, 93% reported satisfaction with the surgery. PASS was achieved in 82% for iHOT-12, with a range of 76% to 91% for HAGOS subscales. Furthermore, 93% exceeded the minimal important change for iHOT-12, and a range of 67% to 84% for HAGOS. Conclusion: In a high-level athletic population, significant improvements in long-term outcomes are reported after hip arthroscopy for FAIS, with patients reporting a high satisfaction rate. The results also show that the largest improvement occurs within the first postoperative year, with results being maintained for 10 years.",2,0,hip; femoroacetabular impingement; hip arthroscopy; football (soccer); ice hockey; medical aspects of sports; athletes; patient-reported outcome measures; CROSS-CULTURAL ADAPTATION; CAM-TYPE DEFORMITY; PHYSICAL FUNCTION; GROIN DISABILITY; VALIDATION; PAIN; SYMPTOMS,Article

Such protocols are currently lacking in Poland. The Australian Palliative Care Outcome Collaboration (PCOC) concept of Palliative phases precisely defines patients, enables episodes of care extraction for benchmarking and further assessment of service delivery. The present study is aimed at developing cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric validation for a Polish translation of Palliative phases.MethodsForward and backward translation was performed to obtain a Polish draft version regarding definitions of the PCOC phases. The draft was then subjected to linguistic and graphical transformations in the process of cognitive interviewing. The acceptability of the Polish version was assessed based on staff perceptions of fit, ease of assignment and familiarity with the patient's and family's situation. Finally, cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 313 hospice and home-care palliative patients. The attending doctor and nurse independently evaluated the same patients using the Polish version of the PCOC phases to establish inter-rater reliability values. Then, to determine its construct validity, the PCOC indicators were referred to patients' prognosis, functioning level and PALCOM scale scores.ResultsA Polish draft version of the PCOC phases was prepared. Seven of the 13 interviewees reported problems with comprehending this proposal. This prompted changes being made to linguistic and graphical aspects of the tool. The majority of respondents preferred the final graphical scheme of phases, prepared after round-two of interviews. Scheme application acceptability was confirmed in a practical trial. The respondents' overall conviction regarding degree of fit and assignment ease was high. Seventy percent of PCOC phase assignments was in agreement, and a moderate level or inter-rater reliability was obtained (kappa 0.573). The highest proportion of totally bed-bound patients with the shortest survival prognosis was observed for the terminal phase, while the highest complexity of palliative care needs was noted for the unstable one.ConclusionsThe PCOC phases tool appears to be a valuable resource for specialists in palliative care settings to support audit measures.

Pockets of practice-based IPE are integrated into healthcare curriculums in some regions. Yet practice-based IPE is not globally valued as a key element of healthcare curriculums. As students and clinical educators are key stakeholders, this study presents a case example of their experiences in a country where practice-based IPE is at an emergent stage. Their experiential knowledge generated important insights into how practice-based IPE is perceived. This learning can be applied, both locally and further afield, by those seeking to embed practice-based IPE in their placement curriculums. Methods A qualitative case study was conducted at a school of allied health and partner placement sites in Ireland. Data collection comprised two participant observations, 13 interviews and 12 document analyses. Inductive thematic analysis and deductive framework analysis, underpinned by activity theory and Hofstede's cultural dimensions, informed data analysis and interpretations. Results Participants are grappling to establish the value of practice-based IPE, illustrated in three themes: clarifying the concept of practice-based IPE, mapping IPE activities and diversifying interprofessionalism. First, ambiguous conceptualisation of why and how to implement practice-based IPE was identified. Highlighting how practice-based IPE improved patient care and safety created a clear rationale for implementation. It was also helpful to demonstrate how adaptations to existing practice education models, rather than entirely new models, could achieve high-quality practice-based IPE. Second, the positioning of practice-base IPE in the placement curriculum was unclear. Overt mapping of practice-based IPE activities onto learning outcomes within assessment tools enhanced its value within practice education. Third, varying levels of professional engagement were noted, perpetuating stereotypes. Creating diverse educator networks and embedding practice-based IPE in organisational strategy may incentivise engagement across a greater range of professions. Conclusions Implementing these recommendations could enhance the value of practice-based IPE and optimise student preparation for collaborative working. Practice-based IPE remains a complex model and the trajectory of embedding in healthcare curriculums will differ globally.",0,0,Interprofessional education; Activity theory; Hofstede&#8217; s cultural dimensions; Qualitative case study; INTERPROFESSIONAL EDUCATION; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; PERCEPTIONS; PLACEMENT; PERSPECTIVE; DIMENSIONS; FRAMEWORK; STUDENTS,Article
Cultural competence in healthcare in the community: A concept analysis,"Henderson, Saras; Horne, Maria; Hills, Ruth; Kendall, Elizabeth; WILEY; Henderson, Saras; Henderson, Saras; Horne, Maria; Hills, Ruth; Kendall, Elizabeth; Kendall, Elizabeth; Henderson, Saras; Henderson, Saras; kendall, elizabeth; Horne, Maria; Kendall, Elizabeth",2018,HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY,10.1111/hsc.12556,WOS:000435783600032,Australia; England,"This study aims to conduct a concept analysis on cultural competence in community healthcare. Clarification of the concept of cultural competence is needed to enable clarity in the definition and operation, research and theory development to assist healthcare providers to better understand this evolving concept. Rodgers' evolutionary concept analysis method was used to clarify the concept's context, surrogate terms, antecedents, attributes and consequences and to determine implications for further research. Articles from 2004 to 2015 were sought from Medline, PubMed, CINAHL and Scopus using the terms cultural competency AND health, cultural competence OR cultural safety OR cultural knowledge OR cultural awareness OR cultural sensitivity OR cultural skill AND Health. Articles with antecedents, attributes and consequences of cultural competence in community health were included. The 26 articles selected included nursing (n=8), health (n=8), psychology (n=2), social work (n=1), mental health (n=3), medicine (n=3) and occupational therapy (n=1). Findings identify cultural openness, awareness, desire, knowledge and sensitivity and encounter as antecedents of cultural competence. Defining attributes are respecting and tailoring care aligned with clients' values, needs, practices and expectations, providing equitable and ethical care, and understanding. Consequences of cultural competence are satisfaction with care, the perception of quality healthcare, better adherence to treatments, effective interaction and improved health outcomes. An interesting finding is that the antecedents and attributes of cultural competence appear to represent a superficial level of understanding, sometimes only manifested through the need for social desirability. What is reported as critical in sustaining competence is the carers' capacity for a higher level of moral reasoning attainable through formal education in cultural and ethics knowledge. Our conceptual analysis incorporates moral reasoning in the definition of cultural competence. Further research to underpin moral reasoning with antecedents, attributes and consequences could enhance its clarity and promote a sustainable enactment of cultural competence.",0,0,community health; cultural awareness; cultural competence; cultural diversity; cultural knowledge; cultural safety; cultural skills; moral reasoning; EVOLUTIONARY-CONCEPT ANALYSIS; NURSING-STUDENTS; SENSITIVITY; EDUCATION; PERSPECTIVES; ATTITUDES; OUTCOMES; ETHICS; MODEL; ADHERENCE,Article
Cultural determinants of infection control behaviour: understanding drivers and implementing effective change,"Borg, M. A.; W B SAUNDERS CO LTD; Borg, M. A.; Borg, M. A.; Borg, M. A.",2014,JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION,10.1016/j.jhin.2013.12.006,WOS:000332871200001,Malta,"Despite dealing with biomedical practices, infection prevention and control (IPC) is essentially a behavioural science. Human behaviour is influenced by various factors, including culture. Hofstede's model of cultural dimensions proposes that national cultures vary along consistent dimensions which can be grouped and scored as specific constructs. Studies have reported that three Hofstede constructs e power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and masculinity e show significant association with several key performance indicators relevant to IPC and antibiotic stewardship. In addition, national meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) levels within Europe correlate well with general quality-of-care indices, including preventive strategies and patient rights. This suggests that IPC may be simply a microcosm of overall quality and safety standards within hospitals and countries. Effective improvement would therefore need to address underlying and embedded core cultural values relevant to patient safety and quality of care. Successful IPC strategies are likely to be those that are compatible with the cultural background where they are implemented. To this end, content analysis of many current IPC improvement tools identifies elements of strong compatibility with cultures that are low in uncertainty avoidance and power distance, and high in individualism and masculinity. However, this cultural combination is largely restricted to Anglo-Saxon countries, where most of the recent improvements in healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) incidence have taken place. There is a paucity of research on IPC behaviour change in different cultural backgrounds, especially countries that score high for power distance and/or uncertainty avoidance. This information is vital to inform IPC campaigns in these countries, which often show high HCAI prevalence. (C) 2014 The Healthcare Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Using the World Cafe method to derive expert consensus, we sought to generate a contemporary list of triggers and adverse event measures that could be used for chart review to determine the current incidence of inpatient and outpatient adverse events. Methods We held a modified World Cafe event in March 2018, during which content experts were divided into 10 tables by clinical domain. After a focused discussion of a prepopulated list of literature-based triggers and measures relevant to that domain, they were asked to rate each measure on clinical importance and suitability for chart review and electronic extraction (very low, low, medium, high, very high). Results Seventy-one experts from 9 diverse institutions attended (primary acceptance rate, 72%). Of 525 total triggers and measures, 67% of 391 measures and 46% of 134 triggers were deemed to have high or very high clinical importance. For those triggers and measures with high or very high clinical importance, 218 overall were deemed to be highly amenable to chart review and 198 overall were deemed to be suitable for electronic surveillance. Conclusions The World Cafe method effectively prioritized measures/triggers of high clinical importance including those that can be used in chart review, which is considered the gold standard. A future goal is to validate these measures using electronic surveillance mechanisms to decrease the need for chart review.",0,0,patient safety; implementation; patient safety culture; coincidence analysis; primary care; patient-centered medical home; ADVERSE EVENTS; HOSPITALIZED-PATIENTS; PATIENT SAFETY; QUALITY; PROGRAM; ERRORS; SYSTEM; RISK,Article

Methods: We used multilevel linear regression analysis on the seventh round of the European Social Survey from 2014, including c. 40,000 respondents from 21 countries. Preliminary intraclass correlation analyses led us to believe that some explanations of variance in the dependent variable were to be found at the country level. In search of country level explanations, we attempted to account for the role of national culture in influencing citizens' attitudes towards health systems. This was done by using Hofstede's dimensions of power distance, individualism, masculinity and uncertainty avoidance, giving each country in the survey a mean aggregated score. Results: In our first model with individual level variables, being female, having low or medium education, experiencing financial strain, and reporting poor health and unmet medical needs were negatively associated with individual satisfaction with national healthcare systems, with the latter variable showing the strongest effect. After including Hofstede's cultural dimensions in our multilevel model, we found that the power distance index variable had a negative effect on the dependent variable, significant at the 0.1 level. Conclusions: Citizens are likely to evaluate their national health system more negatively in national cultures associated with autocracy and hierarchy.",0,0,Public evaluation of healthcare; satisfaction with healthcare; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; multilevel analysis; Europe; European Social Survey (ESS); PATIENT SATISFACTION; CARE-SYSTEMS; GENERAL-PRACTICE; QUALITY; PERFORMANCE,Article

Methods:The study followed an interpretive description approach. Data were collected through four focus group discussions with 21 participants, all health care practitioners, at the study facility. Thematic analysis was conducted by coding the transcripts and generating themes. Findings:Three themes were generated: (1) Current use and gaps in use of the ICF, (2) a non-conducive environment and (3) using the ICF to facilitate holistic, patient-centred management. Current use of the ICF was limited. Gaps in use of the ICF was especially evident in goal setting practices. Goals were generic in nature and did not address participation and the environment. A lack of knowledge, debilitating interpersonal relationships and an unsupportive organisational culture created an environment non-conducive to the implementation of the ICF. Participants felt that the ICF can assist them to work more patient-centred. Conclusion:Participants perceived that the ICF has the potential to improve service delivery at the facility.

With a process model, we highlight the founders' early recognition of a practical incongruence between neutral and expertcentric routines of medical professionals and the cultural attributes of tribal people. Based on their spiritual outlook, we find that founders institutionalize a set of organizational routines and create relational practices of social camaraderie and interpretive bridging, which resolve the practical incongruence and include tribal communities in the fold of modern healthcare provisions. By showcasing the role of founders' imprints, our findings extend organizational imprinting literature on teams' practices and have implications in healthcare delivery to communities.",0,0,Community; Founders; Healthcare; India; Organizational imprinting; Relational practices; Teams; IRON CAGE; IDENTITY; POSITION; SYSTEM; LEGACY; WORK,Article

Ricoeur's narrative philosophy: A source of inspiration in critical hermeneutic health research,"Missel, Malene; Birkelund, Regner; WILEY; Missel, Malene; Birkelund, Regner; Birkelund, Regner; Missel, Malene; Missel, Malene; Missel, Malene",2020,NURSING PHILOSOPHY,10.1111/nup.12254,WOS:000525314300004,Denmark,"Patient-centred care has gained ground in health service following a health policy initiative aimed at changing the paternalistic culture towards one with more patient involvement. Development of knowledge relating to people's lived experiences of illness is important in this context. Literature in the field of health science describes methods for exploring what is at stake for people affected by illness, and the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur has been a significant source of inspiration. Especially, Ricoeur's interpretation theory has been construed and applied in different, often schematic, methodological variations, whereas his narrative philosophy is a little used source of inspiration. Health science has been characterized by a biomedical awareness of method and the idea that there is a direct and immediate path to patients' experiences, a viewpoint that can be traced back to Descartes and the philosophy of subjectivism. Opposed to Descartes, Ricoeur says that we are already embedded in a world of traditions and meanings over which we have no control. According to Ricoeur, we leave traces when we express ourselves, and traces are formed by the world of meanings and traditions to which we belong. Often, the sense in the traces is hidden, making it impossible to directly understand individual's experiences. Reflection on an individual's lived experiences must take place via the narratives in which the individual expresses themselves. The centrepiece of Ricoeur's narrative philosophy is the threefold mimesis, which is an approach to understanding the meaning of peoples' lived experiences. The philosophical hermeneutics of Gadamer plays an important role in Ricoeur's theory of interpretation, although he has criticized Gadamer for failing to include one dimension in his philosophy; he finds this dimension in Habermas' ideology critique. Ricoeur's ideology critique is absent in health science research, which is why it has been made a focal point in this article.",0,0,care; narratives; nursing; qualitative research; Ricoeur,Article

We seek to explore the relationship between cultural factors and participant behaviour patterns as perceived by debriefers during healthcare simulation debriefings. Our research question focuses on elucidating factors that influence debreifing dynamics between and among debriefers and learners according to Hofstede's cultural dimension: the Power Distance Index.Methods and materials: The study employed inductive qualitative analysis following Braun and Clark's 6-step approach to explore debriefers' perceived barriers to discussing non-technical skills including closed-loop communication, situational awareness, and cultural aspects of healthcare simulation debriefing. This study is a complementation to previously published quantitative paper, the qualitative findings are derived from the third section of the interview guide developed by the authors which focused on aspects of the debriefing such as debriefers' perceptions of participant familiarity with non-technical skills and cultural sensitivity.Findings: The responses of 57 debriefers from 26 countries were analysed; 36 (64%) of whom practiced simulation in low power distance index (PDI) countries and 31 (36%) practiced in high PDI countries. We identified three major themes: I. Group dynamics, encompassing challenges of hierarchy, 'speaking up', fear of 'losing face' and 'judgement'. II. Conceptual clarity about debriefing medical/technical content and the challenges of 'language' and III. Institutional 'skepticism' toward simulation as a relatively new method of teaching in many parts of the world. Insights: The findings confirm the social nature of simulation debriefings, where the interactions are guided by motivations and rules, and where more variability can be found within a culture than between cultures. Acknowledging these differences could lead to cultivating new integrative perspectives for all levels of the healthcare system.",0,0,Simulation; Debriefing; Healthcare; Culture,Article

Methods and findings We compared Hofstede's six cultural dimensions against relative health systems performance of 35 countries. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified best-matched groupings of countries. Performance was measured by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD's)Health at a Glanceindicators data framework (five dimensions with 57 indicators) and the United Nations' (UNs') Sustainability Development Goals (SDG) data set (15 indicators). Three country clusters emerged: Collective-Pyramidal (n = 9: comprising Slovak Republic, Mexico, Poland, Greece, Spain, Turkey, Portugal, Chile, and Slovenia); Collaborative-Networked (n = 12: UK, Canada, Australia, USA, Ireland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden); and Orderly-Future Orientated (n = 14: Korea, Estonia, Latvia, Austria, Israel, Japan, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Switzerland). The Collaborative-Networked cluster had significantly better performing health systems measured by both theHealth at a Glanceand SDG performance data, followed by the Orderly-Future Orientated cluster, followed by the Collective-Pyramidal cluster.

This study examines if culture predicts a country's population health, measured as life expectancy and health care spending. Using the Hofstede country-level measures (six dimensions) of culture as independent variables, two regression models to predict life expectancy and per capita health care using 2016 World Bank data were developed. The original data set included 112 countries which was reduced to a final total of 60 due to missing or incomplete data. The first regression model, predicting life expectancy, indicated an adjusted R square of 0.45. The second regression model, predicting per capita health care spending, indicated an adjusted R square of 0.63. The study suggests culture is a predictor of both life expectancy and health care spending. However, by creating a composite measure for all six culture measures, we have not found a significant association between culture and life expectancy and healthcare expenditure. The study is limited by small sample size, differences in geography, climate and political systems.

Research regarding family caregivers suggests normalization as a model for coping with negative emotional outcomes in caring for a person with dementia (PWD). The study aims to explore whether normalization coping mechanism exists among formal caregivers, reveal differences in its application among cross-cultural caregivers, and examine how this coping mechanism may be related to implementing person-centered care for PWDs. Method: Content analysis of interviews with 20 formal caregivers from three cultural groups (Jews born in Israel [JI], Arabs born in Israel [AI], Russian immigrants [RI]), attending to PWDs. Results: We extracted five normalization modes, revealing AI caregivers had substantially more utterances of normalization expressions than their colleagues. Discussion: The normalization modes most commonly expressed by AI caregivers relate to the personhood of PWDs. These normalization modes may enhance formal caregivers' ability to employ person-centered care.",0,0,formal caregivers; coping strategy; dementia; normalization; person-centered care; personhood; PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OLDER-ADULTS; PEOPLE; MODERNIZATION; SATISFACTION; RESEARCHERS; FRAMEWORK; HEALTH; IMPACT,Article

We tested in a large naturalistic data set, if therapists are prone to illusory superiority when estimating their patients' outcome and whether this effect is buffered by therapists' effectiveness. Method: A post-hoc analysis with N = 69 therapists, who treated N = 1080 patients, was conducted. Therapists' and patients' mean ratings for therapeutic improvement in the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) were compared. Using a multilevel modelling approach, we further investigated the relation between the patient-therapist divergence in the CGI and actual therapeutic change in the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory and in the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Results: Ratings in the CGI did not show significant differences between patients' and therapists' assessment of therapeutic change. Lower estimations by therapists, compared to patients' self-report, were associated with greater therapeutic change in GSI and SWLS.

Humanistic nursing care, which emphasizes empathy, respect for individuality, and cultural sensitivity, aims to build trust and improve the overall experience for patients. This approach is especially relevant for rural patients in China, who often face additional challenges in accessing care in large tertiary hospitals.Methods A multistage, stratified sampling method was employed to collect data from 8,263 patients aged 18 years or older in large public tertiary hospitals. Humanistic care satisfaction scores were measured using the Nurse Caring Instrument (NCI) questionnaire, a validated tool for assessing patient satisfaction with nursing care.Results Satisfaction with nursing humanistic care among rural Chinese patients attending large tertiary public hospitals was low with the overall mean satisfaction score 81.62 +/- 16.85. Significant differences in satisfaction were found based on age, marital status, number of children, educational attainment, occupation, monthly household income, department visited, type of medical insurance, and first-time visitor. A multivariate analysis revealed positive correlations with satisfaction for factors such as having children, higher education, higher family monthly income, and first-time visitor, and negative correlations for factors such as older age, being widowed, department visited, and region.Conclusion Older adults, widowed individuals, and first-time patients expressed lower levels of satisfaction, highlighting the need for tailored interventions. The findings provide insights into the impact of humanistic nursing care for rural patients and emphasize the importance of culturally sensitive approaches to improve patient satisfaction in rural China. This study has several limitations. The cross-sectional design restricts the ability to establish causal relationships, and there is a potential for selection bias, as participants who completed the survey may have higher educational and economic levels, possibly leading to an overestimation of satisfaction. Lastly, as this study focused on rural patients in large public tertiary hospitals in China, the findings may not be generalizable to other settings or patient groups. Future studies should address these limitations for broader applicability and insight.",0,0,rural patients; humanistic nursing care; Chinese Public Tertiary Hospitals; patient satisfaction; cross-sectional study; SCIENCE; EXPERIENCE; OUTCOMES,Article

Methods The present cross-sectional population-representative Internet-based study investigated OAB symptoms in men and women aged >= 40 years using the overactive bladder symptom score. Additional instruments included the International Index of Erectile Function (men only) and the Sexual Quality of Life - Female (women only) questionnaires, as well as Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC). Results In all, 8284 individuals participated in the study. The prevalence of OAB was 20.8% overall (women 22.1%, men 19.5%) and increased significantly with age, from 10.8% in those aged 40-44 years to 27.9% in those aged >60 years (P = .001). The presence of comorbid conditions (e.g. neurological disease, diabetes) was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of OAB. Increasing symptom severity was associated with significantly worsening patient perception of bladder condition responses. Just under half (48%) of those with no OAB had no lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), whereas 88% of those with severe symptoms had all 3 LUTS (International Continence Society definition) symptom categories (voiding, post-micturition, and storage symptoms). Of those without OAB, 10% reported visiting healthcare professionals for urinary symptoms, compared with 64% of those with severe OAB symptoms (P = .001). Increased symptom severity was significantly associated with lower sexual quality of life in both men and women. Conclusions OAB symptoms were found to affect 1 in 5 individuals aged >= 40 years in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, becoming more common with increasing age. The results suggest that many more individuals with OAB could benefit by consulting healthcare professionals.",0,0,China; overactive bladder; prevalence; Republic of Korea; Taiwan; URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; RISK-FACTORS; QUESTIONNAIRE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; VALIDATION; PERCEPTION; COMMUNITY; HEALTH; SCALE,Article

International neonatal networks, along with patient registries of premature infants, have contributed to improving the quality of neonatal care; however, the involvement of low-to-middle-income countries was limited. This project aims to form an international collaboration among neonatal networks in Asia (AsianNeo), including low-, middle- and high-income countries (or regions). Specifically, it aims to determine outcomes in sick newborn infants, especially very low birth weight (VLBW) infants or very preterm infants, with a view to improving the quality of care for such infants. Methods and analysis Currently, AsianNeo comprises nine neonatal networks from Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand. AsianNeo will undertake the following four studies: (1) institutional questionnaire surveys investigating neonatal intensive care unit resources and the clinical management of sick newborn infants, with a focus on VLBW infants (nine countries/regions); (2) a retrospective cohort study to describe and compare the outcomes of VLBW infants among Asian countries and regions (four countries/regions); (3) a prospective cohort study to develop the AsianNeo registry of VLBW infants (six countries/regions); and (4) implementation and evaluation of educational and quality improvement projects in AsianNeo countries and regions (nine countries/regions).

The present review explored the impact, diagnosis, prevention and management of sarcopenia in surgical and trauma patients. Recent evidence suggests that there are many factors contributing to its development other than age. Pathophysiology of sarcopenia is complex which makes its diagnosis difficult and there is no universal approach. It is a predictor of poor outcomes including post-operative complications, length of hospital stay and mortality in trauma and surgery patients. Sedentary lifestyle, age-dependent hormone and cytokine imbalance, decreased protein synthesis and regeneration, and motor unit remodelling are some of the main risk factors for sarcopenia. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, bio-electrical impedance analysis and computed tomography are frequently utilized for its diagnosis. Management of sarcopenia involves appropriate management of comorbidities, interventions to facilitate physical activities, nutrition interventions and pharmacotherapy.

These barriers exist for health care organizations, for health care personnel, and for the patients themselves. Solutions to barriers are not well documented.Objectives:Our objective was to explore barriers to patient engagement efforts and their corresponding solutions.Research Design:Qualitative interviews and site visits from a national sample of primary care facilities within the Veterans Health Administration were analyzed to understand patient engagement barriers and solutions.Sampling:We conducted a total of 155 phone and in-person semistructured interviews with primary care providers, mental health staff, social workers, pharmacists, patient advocates, health behavior coaches, and administrative staff at 27 Veterans Health Administration sites. Participants were asked to describe the obstacles they had to overcome in their efforts to improve patient engagement at their site.Results:Barriers to patient engagement are overcome by strategically updating data analytics; enhancing organization-wide processes and procedures; being creative with space design, staff hiring, and time commitments; cultivating staff collaborations; and addressing patient care issues such as access, customer service, and patient education. A key component of successful implementation is to create a culture, supported by leadership that promotes patient engagement.Conclusions:Participants understood the patient centered approach, despite experiencing a lack of resources and training and could push through solutions to patient engagement barriers while working within the limits of their settings.",0,0,patient-centered care; qualitative research; veteran's affairs; patient engagement; barriers to patient engagement; solutions to patient engagement; Patient Aligned Care Teams; quality improvement; healthcare delivery; MEDICAL HOME; VETERANS,Article

Design/methodology/approach The authors asked 51,529 probabilistically selected respondents in 52 countries (50 nationally representative consumer panels and community samples from another two countries) what they would do with their money if they were rich. The questionnaire items targeted Hofstede's MAS-FEM and IDV-COLL as well as a wider range of options deemed sufficiently meaningful, ethical and moral across the world. Findings The authors obtained two main dimensions. The first contrasts self-enhancing and altruistic choices (status and power-seeking spending vs donating for healthcare) and is conceptually similar to MAS-FEM. However, it is statistically related to Hofstede's fifth dimension, or monumentalism-flexibility (MON-FLX), not to MAS-FEM. The second dimension contrasts conservative-collectivist choices and modern-hedonistic concerns (donating for religion and sports vs preserving nature and travel abroad for pleasure) and is a variant of COLL-IDV.",0,0,Consumer behaviour; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Collectivism; Individualism; Masculinity; Femininity; Monumentalism; Flexibility; NATIONAL CULTURE; RESPONSE STYLES; 5TH DIMENSION; VALUES; REVISION; PRODUCTS; BEHAVIOR; TRAITS,Article

For this reason, numerous guidelines have been developed for delirium recognition, prevention and management across different countries and disciplines. Although research is adduced as evidence for these guidelines, a constant finding is the lack of implementation if they exist at all. Implementation is a human behaviour that can be influenced by various factors including culture at a micro- and macro-level. Hofstede's model proposes that national cultures vary along six consistent dimensions. Aim Using this model, we examined the nature of delirium guidelines across countries in relation to Hofstede's six cultural dimensions. Methods Data collected for each country on: the six dimensions of Hofstede's model, number of delirium guidelines approved by a National professional body of each country (through searching databases), the annual old-age dependency ratio for each country. Results Sixty-four countries had the completed six dimensions of Hofstede's model. Twenty of them (31%) had one or more delirium guidelines. The total number of different delirium guidelines was 45. Countries with formal delirium guidelines have significantly lower power distance among their members, are more individualistic societies, have lower levels of uncertainty avoidance and higher old-age dependency ratio compared to those without delirium guidelines. Discussion/conclusion The development and implementation of delirium guidelines vary across countries. Specific combinations of cultural dimensions influence the production of delirium guidelines. Understanding these important cultural differences can facilitate more widespread acceptance and implementation of guidelines.",0,0,Delirium; Guidelines; Culture; Hofstede's cultural model; ANXIETY DISORDERS; CARE; UNDERDIAGNOSIS,Article

Consequently, language barriers and cultural differences may result in miscommunication and tension in the workplace, leading to poor performance and quality of treatment and affecting patient safety. However, there is little information about how foreign doctors and their colleagues perceive their collaboration and handle situations that can affect the quality of health services. Methods: Individual, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with two groups of informants: 16 doctors who had recently started working in Norway and 12 unrelated Norwegian-born healthcare providers who had extensive experience of working with doctors from foreign countries. The interviews were analysed according to the systematic text condensation method. Results: The foreign doctors described themselves as newcomers and found it difficult to speak with their colleagues about their shortcomings because they wanted to be seen as competent. Their Norwegian colleagues reported that many new foreign doctors had demanding work schedules and therefore they were reluctant to give them negative feedback. They also feared that foreign doctors would react negatively to criticism. All participants, both the new foreign doctors and their colleagues, reported that they took responsibility for the prevention of misunderstandings and errors; nevertheless, they struggled to discuss such issues with each other. Conclusions: Silence was the coping strategy adopted by both the foreign doctors and native healthcare professionals when facing difficulties in their working relationships. In such situations, many foreign doctors are socialized into a new workplace in which uncertainty and shortcomings are not discussed openly. Effective leadership and procedures to facilitate communication may alleviate this area of concern.",0,0,International medical graduates; cross-cultural teamwork; safety culture; qualitative study; PERCEPTIONS; EXPERIENCES,Article

In this context, applying a phenomenology of medicine framework or perspective-driven analysis is useful in defining cross-cultural patient-centeredness. This reframing from a naturalistic or objective/biological viewpoint to a phenomenological viewpoint may aid in placing greater epistemic or knowledge authority in the hands of vulnerable and/or marginalized patients- allowing these patients to become key ""knowers"" in the clinical interaction. Moreover, treating Black patients as ""knowers"" emphasizes the prioritization of patient values at the core of providing valuable healthcare. Such an academic, policy, and clinical approach to medicine agrees with well-established principles of medical ethics.

Design Analytical observational study. Setting USA, UK, Sweden, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Ethiopia and Nigeria. Main outcome measures OxCGRT indices were used to quantify variations in governments' responses, and effectiveness was measured by the number of deaths as a proportion of the population. Hofstede's cultural dimensions, and the availability of healthcare resources, were analysed for their potential impact on effectiveness. Results Effective strategies reflect factors such as speed of governmental intervention, cultural norms, population demographics and available resources. While biases, confounders and lack of data at the beginning of the pandemic make inferences challenging, publicly available data suggest that South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan were most successful through rapid identification and isolation of cases, and effective contact tracing systems. Conclusion The rapid spread of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 virus took many countries by surprise and the delayed global response contributed to the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. The speed at which strategies were implemented is highly correlated to the number of deaths. Factors such as cultural norms and healthcare resources impact effectiveness significantly, implying that implementation of a global 'one size fits all' approach is challenging.

A bilingual expert panel rated the cross-cultural relevance and translation equivalence of the instrument. We calculated Content Validity Indexing (CVI) scores at both the item (I-CVI) and scale (S-CVI/Ave) levels to evaluate the relevance of the Vietnamese PCC (VPCC) measure to geriatric care in the Vietnamese context. We piloted the translated instrument VPCC measure with 112 healthcare providers in Hanoi, Vietnam. Multiple logistic regression models were specified to test the a priori null hypothesis that geriatric knowledge is not different among healthcare providers with perception of high implementation compared with low implementation of PCC measures.ResultsOn the item level, all 20 questions had excellent validity ratings. The VPCC had excellent content validity (S-CVI/Ave of 0.96) and translation equivalence (TS- CVI/Ave of 0.94). In the pilot study, the highest-rated PCC elements were the holistic provision of information and collaborative care, while the lowest-rated elements were the holistic attendance to patients' needs and responsive care. Attention to the psychosocial needs of aging people and poor coordination of care within and beyond the health system were the lowest-rated PCC activities. After controlling for healthcare provider characteristics, the odds of the perception of high implementation of collaborative care were increased by 21% for each increase in geriatric knowledge score. We fail to reject the null hypotheses for holistic care, responsive care and PCC.ConclusionThe VPCC is a validated instrument that may be utilized to systemically evaluate the practice of patient-centered geriatric care in Vietnam.",0,0,Geriatrics; Aging; Nurses; Healthcare quality; Cross-cultural adaptation; Vietnam; Healthcare providers; Knowledge translation; Patient-centered care; Person-centered care; QUALITY-OF-CARE; CONTENT VALIDITY; IMPACT; SERVICES,Article

Objective To describe medicine-related problems (MRPs) experienced by SA and ME patients from their perspectives and identify possible contributory factors that may be specific to their cultures. Setting The data were collected in seven pharmacies in London, United Kingdom (UK). Method The study was a qualitative study. Patients were from SA and ME origins, aged over 18 and prescribed three or more regular medicines. Patients were identified when presenting with a prescription. The data were collected in 80 face-to-face semi-structured interviews using Gordon's MRPs tool. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using Gordon's coding frame and Nvivo 10 software. Main outcome measure Describing MRPs experienced by SA and ME patients from their perspectives and identifying possible contributory factors that may be specific to their cultures. Results Eighty participants (61 % male) had mean (SD) age 58 (13.4) years and a mean (SD) of 8 (4) medicines. Interviews revealed that several factors contributed to the development of MRPs; some appeared to be specific to SA and ME cultures and others were similar to the general population. The factors that were reported to be specific to SA and ME groups comprised religious practices and beliefs, use of non-prescription medicines, extent of family support, and travelling abroad-to patient's homeland or to take religious journeys. Illiteracy, language and communication barriers, lack of translated resources, perceptions of healthcare providers, and difficulty consulting a doctor of the same gender may also contribute to the problems. Many of these factors could be expected to influence patient's safety, adherence, and informed decision-making. Conclusion This study demonstrated that SA and ME patients have their own problems and needs regarding both medicine use and service access. By uncovering particular problems experienced by these groups, the study can inform healthcare professionals to support SA and ME patients in the use of their medicines.",0,0,Drug-related problems; Ethnic minorities; Ethnicity; Medication errors; Medication-related problems; Medicine use; Patient perspective; Primary care; United Kingdom; ACCESS; IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; BARRIERS; CARE,Article

Although HTA was identified as an important prioritization tool when adding new technologies to benefit packages, it is used inconsistently in the region, resulting in a less transparent decision-making process for stakeholders. Although regional challenges exist around real-world data (RWD), including a lack of capacity to enable information and data sharing, most policy or funding decision makers in the region have access to data. However, there appears to be a disconnect with the experience of industry, whose representatives identify the lack of RWD as their primary issue. To overcome these issues, both HTA agencies and industry agree that collaboration and transparency should be fostered to support the development of robust evidence generation in the region.Conclusions:There is a willingness for HTA agencies and industry to collaborate to develop HTA methodology for the prioritization of technologies in the Asia region that support healthcare systems to achieve the ultimate outcome of UHC.",0,0,Universal coverage; Patient generated health data; Technology assessment; Health; Decision making; FAIR CHOICES; COVERAGE; PATH,Article

The objectives of our study were to evaluate the effect of race/ ethnicity on access to acute stroke care and treatments and outcomes. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled adult patients admitted to the emergency department of a comprehensive stroke center for suspected stroke. Based on race/ethnicity, patients were divided into two main groups: Western European Whites (WEW) and non-Western European Whites (nWEW). We also divided the nWEW group into four subgroups based on the Office of Management and Budget classification of human races and ethnicities (White-Others, Hispanic, Asian, Black). Univariate comparisons and logistic regression analyses were also performed. Results: 9167 patients were enrolled in the study: 582 in the nWEW and 8585 in the WEW group. Patients with ischemic stroke in the nWEW group were significantly younger than those in the other group (p < 0.001). Once adjusted for possible confounders, belonging to the nWEW group was found to be an independent predictor of a lower likelihood of receiving revascularization treatments (p = 0.006), regardless similar onset-to-door times. There were no differences in stroke outcomes and prevalence of stroke mimic diagnosis between the groups. Conclusions: Racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare represent a challenging issue, even in universal healthcare systems, that should be addressed promptly through education campaigns of healthcare personnel and implementation measures, such as integrating readily available interpreter staff for medical emergencies.",0,0,Stroke care access; Acute stroke treatments; Racial inequalities; Ethnicity; Revascularization treatments; RACE/ETHNICITY; DISPARITIES; OUTCOMES; RACE,Article

It is yet unclear whether MS disease characteristics and clinical course differ amongst Asian racial groups. Singapore is uniquely poised to investigate this as its multi-racial population comprises three genetically diverse Asian racial groups-Chinese, Malay and South Asian. Herein, we sought to elucidate differences in the clinical phenotypes, disease-modifying therapy (DMT) usage, and disease course amongst these three Asian racial groups by performinga retrospective observational study on MS patients seen at the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore. Data on demographics, disease characteristics, ancillary investigations, and DMT usage were collected. One hundred and eighty-eight patients were included (90 Chinese, 32 Malay, and 66 South Asian). Our findings showed that MS prevalence was the highest in South Asians followed by Malays and Chinese, while demographics, healthcare access, and longer-term disease course were identical across the racial groups. However, several differences and trends were elucidated: (1) South Asian patients had milder sentinel attacks (p = 0.006), (2) a higher proportion of Malay patients had enhancing lesions on their initial MRI (p = 0.057) and the lesion topography differed across the races (p = 0.034), and (3) more Malay patients switched out of their initial DMT (p = 0.051).

In comparison to the native population, the prevalence is significantly higher and the prevalence of CVD risk factors is increasing rapidly. The cardiovascular risk profile and 10-year risk scores of South Asian descendants were evaluated in two cohorts with a 10-year time difference. Methods Two cross-sectional studies, conducted in 2004 and 2014, focused on asymptomatic South Asian descendants aged 18-59 years were performed. A short questionnaire, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, and nonfasting blood tests were obtained. The cohort of 2014 was matched with the cohort of 2004, based on age, gender, and family history of CVD. Results In 2014, 674 South Asians (44% men, age 38.2 +/- 12.0 years) were matched with 674 South Asians (44% men, age 38.3 +/- 12.1 years) included in 2004. Notably, hypertension prevalence decreased significantly in 2014 (10.6% vs 23.1% in 2004, P < 0.001), while mean BMI increased (26.1 vs 24.9, P < 0.001). The mean Framingham risk score was lower in 2014 (5.31 +/- 6.19%) than in 2004 (6.45 +/- 8.02%, P < 0.05). Conclusion This study demonstrates that South Asian descendants in 2014 have a lower but still high absolute risk for coronary events compared to 2004. Important differences in cardiovascular risk profile exist. Despite improvements, South Asian descendants in 2014 still face a high absolute risk for coronary events compared to 2004, indicating the necessity for continued primary prevention and lifestyle interventions.",0,0,cardiovascular risk; coronary artery disease; Framingham risk score; South Asians; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; BODY-MASS INDEX; LOW-DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN; MORTALITY; INDIANS; ETHNICITY; EXPLAIN; CHINESE; BRENT; FAT,Article

However, existing research suffers from a lack of cross-cultural comparisons among countries. By conducting this comparative study, we hope to achieve a clear understanding of the linkages and differences among healthcare cultures in different Chinese societies, which may serve as a reference for promoting ACP by considering cultural differences. Methods: Our researchers recruited Chinese adults who could communicate in Mandarin and lived in metropolitan areas in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia. Focus group interviews were conducted, and the interview contents were recorded and subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Between June and July 2017, 14 focus groups with 111 participants were conducted in four regions. With traditional Chinese attitudes towards death as a taboo, many participants felt it would be challenging to discuss ACP with elderly family members. Most participants also desire to avoid suffering for the self and family members. Although the four regions' participants shared a similar Chinese cultural context, significant regional differences were found in the occasions at which participants would engage in end-of-life discussions and select settings for end-of-life care. By contrast, participants from Singapore and Australia exhibited more open attitudes. Most participants from Taiwan and Hong Kong showed a preference for end-of-life care at a hospital. Conclusions: The developmental experiences of ACP in Western countries, which place a strong emphasis on individual autonomy, cannot be directly applied to family-centric Asian ones. Healthcare professionals in Asian societies should make continuous efforts to communicate patient status to patients and their family members to ensure family involvement in decision-making processes.",0,0,advance care planning; culture; cross culture research; DEATH; AMERICANS; JAPANESE; HEALTH; HOME,Article
Health-related stigma of noncommunicable neurological disease in rural adult populations: A scoping review,"Elliot, Valerie L.; Morgan, Debra; Kosteniuk, Julie; Chow, Amanda Froehlich; Bayly, Melanie; WILEY; Elliot, Valerie L.; Morgan, Debra; Kosteniuk, Julie; Chow, Amanda Froehlich; Bayly, Melanie; Elliot, Valerie L.; Elliot, Valerie",2019,HEALTH & SOCIAL CARE IN THE COMMUNITY,10.1111/hsc.12694,WOS:000471832800003,Canada,"Stigma is a widely recognised public health issue. Many people with neurological disease and their families experience stigmatisation, adding to their burden of illness. Rural populations are typically small, lack anonymity, and often have a higher proportion of older adults with inadequate access to specialised services and resources. Although generally isolated, rural areas can offer benefits such as a sense of familiarity and interconnectedness. The purpose of this scoping review was to map the existing evidence on stigma associated with non-communicable neurological disease in rural adult populations and identify key findings and gaps in the literature. Our literature search of peer-reviewed English language articles published from 1 January 1992 to 22 June 2017 was conducted across five databases yielding 8,209 results. After duplicate removal, pairs of reviewers independently screened 6,436 studies according to inclusion criteria developed a priori; 36 articles were identified for inclusion in this review. Study characteristics were described and illustrated by frequency distribution, findings were grouped thematically, and each of the five types of stigma were identified (social, self, health professional, associative, structural). Four factors influencing stigma (knowledge, familiarity, beliefs, and rurality) and four overarching stigma-related themes (concealment; exclusion; disempowerment, discrimination, and unequal opportunities; and issues related to healthcare systems and providers) emerged. In urban-rural comparison studies, rural residents were generally less knowledgeable about the neurological disease and more stigmatised. The impact of other factors (i.e., gender, age, and education) on stigma varied and are stated where associations were reported. Three main gaps were identified including: low attention to stigma related to neurological diseases other than epilepsy, limited cross-cultural comparisons of stigma related to neurological disease, and inclusion of gender as a variable in the analysis of stigma-related outcomes in only half of the reviewed studies.

CJD patients usually present with rapid cognitive impairment associated with declines in cerebellar, motor, visual, behavioral, and swallowing functions. Moreover, CJD patients lose their ability to eat and take medications orally very early on in treatment; nevertheless, there are no specific nutritional guidelines for this disease shared worldwide. (2) Methods: This review aims to describe the nutritional outcomes of CJD patients in Western countries to compare them with those described in East Asian countries and then aims to explore the most recent trends in the nutritional management of CJD patients, including some dietary compounds that present neuroprotective effects. (3) Results: In Japan's, Taiwan's, and China's healthcare systems, CJD patients receive intensive life-sustaining treatment that prolongs their survival (i.e., artificial feeding); conversely, in Western countries, intensive life-sustaining treatments like tube feeding are not commonly provided to CJD patients. (4) Conclusions: It is difficult to pinpoint the reasons for these discrepancies around CJD palliative care supply, but it is clear that specific nutritional guidelines may directly improve the nutritional management of CJD patients and thus allow their families and caregivers to ensure the best end-of-life care for these patients.",0,0,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; prion disease; artificial feeding; tube feed; gastrostomy; nutrition management; PERCUTANEOUS ENDOSCOPIC GASTROSTOMY; SWALLOWING FUNCTION; PREVENTION; PREDICTORS; SURVIVAL; CARE,Review

Using SERVQUAL Method to Assess Tourist Service Quality by the Example of the Silesian Museum Established on the Post-Mining Area,"Kowalska, Natalia; Ostrega, Anna; MDPI; Kowalska, Natalia; Ostrega, Anna; Kowalska, Natalia; Ostrega, Anna; Kowalska, Natalia; Kowalska, Natalia",2020,LAND,10.3390/land9090333,WOS:000581995300001,Poland,"The increasing role of the tourism industry in the global economy and the growing competition makes it necessary to ensure constant performance and continually improve quality. The paper draws attention to the necessity of conducting research on tourist attraction quality also in post-industrial areas which have become attractive tourist sites. It is emphasised that industrial tourism is a new yet quickly developing phenomenon in Poland, which compels managers to differentiate their service range and improve quality standards. The paper employs the SERVQUAL (SERvice QUALity) method to assess the quality of tourist services as a theoretical instrument to measure overall visitor satisfaction. The subject of the research was the Silesian Museum, which is result of reclamation and revitalisation of the inactive ""Katowice"" Hard Coal Mine. The article presents an empirical verification of the methodology which was modified for the purposes of the research subject. The Museum is considered to be one of the most important cultural centres and a crucial element of the social life of the Silesia region where mining activity has been carried out for centuries. Thirty young people from different continents participated in the survey. The results demonstrated that the expectations of the visitors were not met in three cases only which suggests a very high quality of the Silesian Museum. Moreover, the presented results show increasing capabilities and opportunities to maintain a high quality of services in the studied facility. The findings indicate that the appropriately modified SERVQUAL methodology is a valuable and simple tool to evaluate visitor satisfaction. The results of the evaluation of the Silesian Museum services will be presented to the facility managers. Further research will be carried out after the improvement and implementation of the next stage of the Museum's development.",0,0,post-mining land use; industrial tourism; SERVQUAL method; SATISFACTION; MODEL; PERCEPTIONS; SCALE,Article

Equity is conceptualized as the absence of differences in healthcare access and quality among population groups. Healthcare policies are guides for front-line practices, and despite merits of contemporary policies striving to foster equitable healthcare, inequities persist. The purpose of this umbrella review is to identify prenatal healthcare practices, summarize how equities/inequities are reported in relation to patient experiences or health outcomes when accessing or using services, and collate equity reporting characteristics.MethodsFor this umbrella review, six electronic databases were searched (Medline, EMBASE, APA PsychInfo, CINAHL, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, and Cochrane Library). Included studies were extracted for publication and study characteristics, equity reporting, primary outcomes (prenatal care influenced by equity/inequity) and secondary outcomes (infant health influenced by equity/inequity during pregnancy). Data was analyzed deductively using the PROGRESS-Plus equity framework and by summative content analysis for equity reporting characteristics. The included articles were assessed for quality using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews.ResultsThe search identified 8065 articles and 236 underwent full-text screening. Of the 236, 68 systematic reviews were included with first authors representing 20 different countries. The population focus of included studies ranged across prenatal only (n = 14), perinatal (n = 25), maternal (n = 2), maternal and child (n = 19), and a general population (n = 8). Barriers to equity in prenatal care included travel and financial burden, culturally insensitive practices that deterred care engagement and continuity, and discriminatory behaviour that reduced care access and satisfaction. Facilitators to achieve equity included innovations such as community health workers, home visitation programs, conditional cash transfer programs, virtual care, and cross-cultural training, to enhance patient experiences and increase their access to, and use of health services. There was overlap across PROGRESS-Plus factors.ConclusionsThis umbrella review collated inequities present in prenatal healthcare services, globally. Further, this synthesis contributes to future solution and action-oriented research and practice by assembling evidence-informed opportunities, innovations, and approaches that may foster equitable prenatal health services to all members of diverse communities.",0,0,Prenatal; Antenatal; Pregnancy; Health services; Health equity; Inequity; Umbrella review; Review of reviews; PROGRESS-plus; CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS; MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; CONSOLIDATED FRAMEWORK; WOMENS EXPERIENCES; SEARCH STRATEGIES; BIRTH OUTCOMES; UNITED-KINGDOM; NEWBORN HEALTH; ANTENATAL CARE,Article

Occupational MI has been studied mainly among military personnel and first responders and is linked to mental health problems. MI encompasses negative moral emotions such as shame, guilt, and anger leading to distress, and impairment in social and occupational functioning. The COVID-19 pandemic predisposed healthcare providers to moral dilemmas, potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs), and MI. We aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of MI in healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan.Materials and methodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in July-October 2021 among physician/clinician staff working at teaching hospitals in Lahore. The Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professionals (MISS-HP) was used to collect data. SPSS 26 was used for data analysis applying Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests on non-normally distributed data at alpha = 0.05. Predictors of MI were ascertained through Binary Logistic Regression analysis.ResultsFour hundred and twenty physicians responded to the questionnaires. The Median (IQR) MI scores were 37(28-47). Guilt, moral concerns, and shame were higher-scoring MI dimensions. 40.8% (n = 171) suffered from clinically significant distress and impaired functioning while 14.3% (n = 60) from severe distress. Gender, department, and history of psychiatric illness predicted higher levels of distress which were 1.9 times higher in females than males and 2.5 times higher with a history of psychiatric illness. Working on the front lines did not predict MI.ConclusionOur findings highlight the substantial burden of MI in our sample during COVID-19, having implications for healthcare providers' well-being, healthcare quality, and service delivery. This calls for concerted efforts from all stakeholders to better prepare for future disasters through effective human-resource policies, pre-trauma exposure soft-skills training, effective teamwork and communication strategies; self-stewardship and resilience modules, and mental health support for healthcare providers. The dimensional construct of MI may vary across cultures; hence we recommend further cross-cultural research on MI in healthcare providers, particularly in the context of public health disasters.",0,0,moral injury; Covid-19 pandemic; potentially morally injurious events; SARS-CoV 2 pandemic; healthcare providers; Pakistan,Article

Susceptibilities of older persons resulting from lower knowledge about services availability, health illiteracy, lower income, higher mental decline, or physical limitations need to be identified and monitored to assure the equity and quality of health care. The aim of this study was to develop equity indicators for the Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE)-3 checklist and perform the first cross-cultural adaptation and validation of this checklist into Portuguese. Methods A scoping literature review of determinants or indicators of health (in)equity in the care of older people was performed. A total of 5 language experts and 18 health professionals were involved in the development and validation of the equity and quality indicators through expert opinion and focus groups. Data collected from focus groups was analyzed through directed or conventional content analysis. The usefulness of the indicators was assessed by analyzing the clinical records of 30 patients. Results The literature review revealed that there was a worldwide gap concerning equity indicators for older people primary health care. A structured and complete checklist composed of equity and quality indicators was obtained, validated and assessed. A significant number of non-screened quality or equity related potential occurrences that could have been avoided if the proposed indicators were implemented were detected. The percentage of non-registered indicators was 76.6% for quality and 96.7% for equity.

Consumer perspectives of quality care: Exploring patient journeys from remote primary healthcare clinics to Alice Springs Hospital,"Lankin, Emslie; Graf, Amanda; Schultz, Rebecca; Johnson, Richard; McCullough, Kylie; ELSEVIER; Lankin, Emslie; Johnson, Richard; Graf, Amanda; McCullough, Kylie; Schultz, Rebecca; McCullough, Kylie; Mccullough, Kylie; Schultz, Rebecca",2023,COLLEGIAN,10.1016/j.colegn.2023.05.003,WOS:001149774500001,Australia,"Problem or background: Residents of Australia's remote regions have lower life expectancies and poorer health outcomes than other Australians. Access to hospital and specialist care frequently requires transport via road or air and time spent away from family and community. Question, hypothesis or aim: To explore consumer perspectives of the journey from remote communities to regional health services and identify areas for improvement. Methods: Individual interviews (n = 16) and yarning circles were used to collect and interpret stories of patient's journeys. Findings: Travel for medical care was common and often required multiple journeys. Complex social and financial barriers to accessing care included costs associated with travel, food, and accommodation for patients and their families, a lack of understanding of the process and requirements of retrieval, difficulty arranging own road transport, and lack of availability of services within the community. These barriers extend to difficulties in attending follow-up outpatient appointments and return to the community after a journey to the hospital. Discussion: Educational resources may also be used to describe the retrieval process to remote community members to demystify acute health care in Central Australia but also to express the health service commitment to quality improvement through consumer voice. These resources may be used to orientate new health service employees to patient experiences and perspectives so that these can be incorporated into care planning to enhance cross-cultural understanding. Conclusion: Travel to access healthcare is an essential component of health services for remote communities. Targeted education for residents on travel expectations and education for staff may significantly reduce barriers to healthcare access. (c) 2023 Australian College of Nursing Ltd.

However, significant racial/ethnic differences exist regarding acceptance of PGT contributing to disparities. Latinas (Latinx), one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, have low PGT acceptance rates. This systematic scoping review aimed to provide a landscape of existing literature on Latinx individuals' knowledge of, preferences for, and experiences with prenatal and preconception genetic testing. Synthesizing the current state of the science may inform development of culturally tailored interventions to support high-quality PGT decisions (e.g., informed, aligned with a pregnant persons' values). Methods We conducted a structured, systematic literature search of published articles and gray literature in electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Medline, Embase, Eric, Social Services Abstracts, and PsycArticles). Articles in English published prior to March 2021 were retrieved relating to genetics, pregnancy, and Latina women. Articles underwent title, abstract and full-text review by independent investigators to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risk of bias was evaluated by two investigators. Iterative thematic analysis was employed to group study findings into themes to identify possible targets for interventions. Results The search generated 5511 unique articles. After title screening, 335 underwent abstract review and subsequently 61 full-text review. Twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria and 7 additional studies were included after reviewing reference lists. Three overarching themes emerged: genetic knowledge/literacy (26/35, 74%), provider (mis)communication/patient satisfaction (21/35, 60%), and cross-cultural beliefs (12/35, 34%). Studies indicate discordant patient-provider language (n = 5), miscommunication (n = 4), and lack of concordant decision-making (n = 4) pose barriers to high-quality PGT decisions. Immigration status (n = 1) and religious beliefs (n = 5) are additional factors influencing PGT decisions. Conclusions Identified studies suggest that cultural and linguistic factors affect Latinx PGT decision-making. Latinx individual's comprehension and recall of PGT information is enhanced by culturally and linguistically concordant providers-suggesting that culturally-informed interventions may enhance PGT acceptability and support high-quality decisions. Future directions to surmount PGT disparities may include community health workers and cultural brokers to empower Latinx people to make informed decisions aligned with their values and preferences.",0,0,Health literacy; Genetic counseling; Genetic testing; Genomic healthcare; Genetic literacy; Attitudes; Prenatal testing; Latinx populations; DECISION-MAKING; DIAGNOSIS; WOMEN; PERCEPTIONS; INFORMATION; ETHNICITY; REASONS; HEALTH; CARE,Review

However, assessing and improving the cross-cultural competence of healthcare professionals is difficult in Japan, as there is no standardized scale to measure the competence. This study's purpose was to translate the Cross-Cultural Competence instrument for Healthcare Professionals (CCCHP), which was developed and used in Europe, and to examine its reliability and validity among Japanese nurses.MethodsDuring June and July 2021, nursing staff were invited to take web- and paper-based surveys in Okinawa Japan. The CCCHP (five-factor model with 27 items across motivation, attitude, skills, emotion, and knowledge) was translated using a combination translation method, and a five-point Likert scale was used for responses. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and known-group method were used to examine structural validity, while Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to test reliability.ResultsA total of 294 responses were analyzed; 77.2% had more than five years of experience. Since the fit index indicated that the five-factor model was not a good fit, it was modified to a four-factor model (J-CCCHP24) by moving three variables, removing the knowledge factor, and using the error covariance of the variables. The fit index after the modification was improved to comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.92, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = 0.91, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.06, and Cronbach's alpha was 0.85. The mean scores of J-CCCHP24 were significantly higher in the group with a history of overseas travel, higher foreign language skill, training in intercultural care, experience of foreign patient care, and intercultural interactions outside the workplace than in the group without these characteristics.ConclusionThis study confirmed the validity and reliability of the modified Japanese version of the CCCHP (four-factor model with 24 items). The results suggest that the exposure to different cultures on a personal level may help improve nurses' cross-cultural competence. Further refinement of this scale for practical use would encourage the implementation of necessary countermeasures to improve the cross-cultural competence of Japanese healthcare professionals.",0,0,Cross-cultural competence; Japanese nurses; Psychometric properties; Scale validity and reliability; Multicultural care,Article

This study aimed to identify the profile of service use, barriers to access care, and factors related to those barriers in Brazilian families with children with ASD. A total of 927 families with children with ASD (3-17 years) from five Brazilian regions completed an online version of the Caregivers Needs Survey. Results showed that the most used services were behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy, while the most used professionals were neurologists, nutritionists, speech therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and pediatricians. The main barriers included waiting lists, costs, and the absence of services or treatment. Service use varied according to age, the region of residence, type of health care system used, and the parents/caregivers' education.
