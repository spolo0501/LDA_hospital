However, inappropriate healthcare contributes to health disparities between populations of aging people and leads to care dependency and social isolation. Tools to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of quality improvement interventions for geriatric care in LMICs are limited. The aim of this study was to provide a validated and culturally relevant instrument to assess patient-centered care in Vietnam, where the population of aging people is growing rapidly.MethodsThe Patient-Centered Care (PCC) measure was translated from English to Vietnamese using forward-backward method. The PCC measure grouped activities into sub-domains of holistic, collaborative, and responsive care. A bilingual expert panel rated the cross-cultural relevance and translation equivalence of the instrument. We calculated Content Validity Indexing (CVI) scores at both the item (I-CVI) and scale (S-CVI/Ave) levels to evaluate the relevance of the Vietnamese PCC (VPCC) measure to geriatric care in the Vietnamese context. We piloted the translated instrument VPCC measure with 112 healthcare providers in Hanoi, Vietnam. Multiple logistic regression models were specified to test the a priori null hypothesis that geriatric knowledge is not different among healthcare providers with perception of high implementation compared with low implementation of PCC measures.ResultsOn the item level, all 20 questions had excellent validity ratings. The VPCC had excellent content validity (S-CVI/Ave of 0.96) and translation equivalence (TS- CVI/Ave of 0.94). In the pilot study, the highest-rated PCC elements were the holistic provision of information and collaborative care, while the lowest-rated elements were the holistic attendance to patients' needs and responsive care. Attention to the psychosocial needs of aging people and poor coordination of care within and beyond the health system were the lowest-rated PCC activities. After controlling for healthcare provider characteristics, the odds of the perception of high implementation of collaborative care were increased by 21% for each increase in geriatric knowledge score. We fail to reject the null hypotheses for holistic care, responsive care and PCC.ConclusionThe VPCC is a validated instrument that may be utilized to systemically evaluate the practice of patient-centered geriatric care in Vietnam.",0,0,Geriatrics; Aging; Nurses; Healthcare quality; Cross-cultural adaptation; Vietnam; Healthcare providers; Knowledge translation; Patient-centered care; Person-centered care; QUALITY-OF-CARE; CONTENT VALIDITY; IMPACT; SERVICES,Article

However, benchmarks of how to define and evaluate successful patient-centeredness have not been sufficiently established. Such ill-defined evaluation criteria can further exacerbate systemic inequities in maximum quality health care delivery, especially based on the intersectional diversity of various patient populations. In this context, applying a phenomenology of medicine framework or perspective-driven analysis is useful in defining cross-cultural patient-centeredness. This reframing from a naturalistic or objective/biological viewpoint to a phenomenological viewpoint may aid in placing greater epistemic or knowledge authority in the hands of vulnerable and/or marginalized patients- allowing these patients to become key ""knowers"" in the clinical interaction. Moreover, treating Black patients as ""knowers"" emphasizes the prioritization of patient values at the core of providing valuable healthcare. Such an academic, policy, and clinical approach to medicine agrees with well-established principles of medical ethics. In addition, the framework of a phenomenology of medicine can better facilitate physician-patient communication and interaction by delineating often muddled hermeneutics.",0,0,Value-based healthcare; Health equity; Patient-centered healthcare; Phenomenology; healthcare; IMPLICIT BIAS; HEALTH; PHENOMENOLOGY; DISPARITIES; RACE,Review

Hospitals strive to pursue quality and safety of healthcare services, with evidence of patient safety incidents in medical practice demonstrating the importance of promoting a safety culture. Measuring patient safety culture is a necessary first step to improving safety culture in clinical settings. As a hospital, dental hospital should improve the quality and culture of patient safety. Thus, our objective was to conduct a cross-cultural adaptation of a US measure of dental office patient safety culture for use in Indonesian dental hospitals.MethodA cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 respondents at a dental hospital in Java, Indonesia. The first stage includes cultural adaptation and translation, followed by developing a questionnaire that was tested through expert agreement and analysis of validity and reliability using Spearman, Cronbach correlation coefficients, and correlation coefficients between classes. The Dental Office Survey on Patient Safety Culture consists of 58 items and 10 dimensions (overall perceptions of patient safety and quality, organizational learning, teamwork, staff training, work pressure and pace, management support for patient safety, office processes and standardization, communication about errors, communication openness, and patient care tracking/follow-up).ResultsA total of 200 respondents with a response rate of 61.5% and 77 invalid responses due to incomplete filling, so 123 respondents were analyzed. The validity test results on 38 question items from 10 dimensions, with a sign of 0.05%, 35 items are declared valid.ConclusionsThe Indonesian version of the Dental Office Survey on Patient Safety Culture shows good validity and good reliability and has the potential to be used to evaluate patient safety culture in dental hospitals in Indonesia.",0,0,patient safety; patient safety culture; dental hospital; DENTISTRY,Article

In the context of maternal health during pregnancy, evaluating prenatal care quality significantly impacts positive outcomes for both mothers and infants. The purpose to adapt the Prenatal Care Quality Questionnaire (QPCQ) into Persian was to assess its cross-cultural suitability and psychometric properties for expectant mothers' well-being during pregnancy. Methods: Following the original tool designer's translation protocol, we assessed the face validity qualitatively through cognitive interviews and evaluated content validity via an expert panel. Administered Persian version of QPCQ to 460 postpartum women with original designer's approval for construct validity assessment in a descriptive study. Confirmatory factor analysis and convergent validity were used for this purpose. Additionally, we calculated Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient to determine reliability. IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Amos 24 software were utilized for statistical computations. Results: The Cronbach's alpha index demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha = 0.95) among the scale items. Additionally, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.86-0.97), indicating strong agreement between raters or measurements.

Another common curricular need of health professional programs is interprofessional education (IPE). This study presents data that evaluates two IPE culturally competent communication sessions designed for pharmacy and nursing students. Teams of nursing and pharmacy students (n=160) engaged in case studies focused on developing cross-cultural communication skills, using the LEARN model. Quantitative survey data collected pre-test and post-test measured cultural competency (including subscales of perceived skills, perceived knowledge, confidence in encounter, and attitude) and knowledge related to culturally competent communication. Univariate ANOVA results indicate that actual knowledge as measured by the test and all four Clinical Cultural Competency Questionnaire (CCCQ) subscales significantly increased after the IPE sessions. Pharmacy students scored higher than nursing students on the knowledge pre-test, and nursing students had a more positive attitude at pre-test.

This understanding is crucial for achieving health equity and improving health outcomes for women and infants. Objectives: This study aims to examine and synthesize qualitative evidence on the perspectives and experiences of South Asian women regarding maternity care services in destination countries. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute's approach. Eight databases were searched for studies capturing the qualitative views and experiences of South Asian women - Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Global Health, Scopus, PsycInfo, British Nursing Index and the Applied Social Science Index and Abstracts. Qualitative and mixed method studies written in English are included. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the JBI's QARI checklist for qualitative studies and the MMAT checklist for mixed-methods studies. Results: Fourteen studies, including twelve qualitative and two mixed-methods studies, were identified and found to be of high methodological quality. The overarching theme that emerged was ""navigating cross-cultural maternity care experiences."" This theme encapsulates the challenges and complexities faced by South Asian women in destination countries, including ethnocultural and religious differences, communication and language barriers, understanding different medical systems, and the impact of migration on their maternity care experiences. Conclusions: South Asian migrant women often have expectations that differ from the services provided in destination countries, leading to challenges in their social relationships. Communication and language barriers pose additional obstacles that can be addressed through strategies promoting better communication and culturally sensitive care. To enhance the utilization of maternity healthcare services, it is important to address these factors and provide personalized, culturally sensitive care for South Asian migrant women.",0,0,South Asian women; Maternity care services; Migration; Cultural differences; Religious differences; Healthcare system; PAKISTANI WOMEN; PREGNANCY; CHALLENGES,Article

Consequently, language barriers and cultural differences may result in miscommunication and tension in the workplace, leading to poor performance and quality of treatment and affecting patient safety. However, there is little information about how foreign doctors and their colleagues perceive their collaboration and handle situations that can affect the quality of health services. Methods: Individual, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with two groups of informants: 16 doctors who had recently started working in Norway and 12 unrelated Norwegian-born healthcare providers who had extensive experience of working with doctors from foreign countries. The interviews were analysed according to the systematic text condensation method. Results: The foreign doctors described themselves as newcomers and found it difficult to speak with their colleagues about their shortcomings because they wanted to be seen as competent. Their Norwegian colleagues reported that many new foreign doctors had demanding work schedules and therefore they were reluctant to give them negative feedback. They also feared that foreign doctors would react negatively to criticism. All participants, both the new foreign doctors and their colleagues, reported that they took responsibility for the prevention of misunderstandings and errors; nevertheless, they struggled to discuss such issues with each other. Conclusions: Silence was the coping strategy adopted by both the foreign doctors and native healthcare professionals when facing difficulties in their working relationships. In such situations, many foreign doctors are socialized into a new workplace in which uncertainty and shortcomings are not discussed openly.

Many people with neurological disease and their families experience stigmatisation, adding to their burden of illness. Rural populations are typically small, lack anonymity, and often have a higher proportion of older adults with inadequate access to specialised services and resources. Although generally isolated, rural areas can offer benefits such as a sense of familiarity and interconnectedness. The purpose of this scoping review was to map the existing evidence on stigma associated with non-communicable neurological disease in rural adult populations and identify key findings and gaps in the literature. Our literature search of peer-reviewed English language articles published from 1 January 1992 to 22 June 2017 was conducted across five databases yielding 8,209 results. After duplicate removal, pairs of reviewers independently screened 6,436 studies according to inclusion criteria developed a priori; 36 articles were identified for inclusion in this review. Study characteristics were described and illustrated by frequency distribution, findings were grouped thematically, and each of the five types of stigma were identified (social, self, health professional, associative, structural). Four factors influencing stigma (knowledge, familiarity, beliefs, and rurality) and four overarching stigma-related themes (concealment; exclusion; disempowerment, discrimination, and unequal opportunities; and issues related to healthcare systems and providers) emerged. In urban-rural comparison studies, rural residents were generally less knowledgeable about the neurological disease and more stigmatised. The impact of other factors (i.e., gender, age, and education) on stigma varied and are stated where associations were reported. Three main gaps were identified including: low attention to stigma related to neurological diseases other than epilepsy, limited cross-cultural comparisons of stigma related to neurological disease, and inclusion of gender as a variable in the analysis of stigma-related outcomes in only half of the reviewed studies.

A total of 927 families with children with ASD (3-17 years) from five Brazilian regions completed an online version of the Caregivers Needs Survey. Results showed that the most used services were behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy, while the most used professionals were neurologists, nutritionists, speech therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and pediatricians. The main barriers included waiting lists, costs, and the absence of services or treatment. Service use varied according to age, the region of residence, type of health care system used, and the parents/caregivers' education. Access to behavioral interventions was more frequent among users of the private system/health insurance and families whose caregivers had higher education. The absence of specialized services/treatments was less frequent among residents of state capitals and families whose caregivers had higher levels of education. This study highlights how families with children/adolescents with ASD in Brazil face significant barriers to access care related to sociodemographic factors.",0,0,autism spectrum disorder; low and middle-income countries; cross-cultural; healthcare utilization; treatment barriers; child; EARLY IDENTIFICATION; HEALTH-CARE; DIAGNOSIS; IMPACT,Article

They use, among others, emergency medical services provided by healthcare professionals: doctors, nurses, and paramedics. Skillful care for culturally different patients requires cultural competencies and cultural intelligence to ensure good quality of care and cultural safety. The study aimed to measure and assess the cultural competencies and cultural intelligence of medical professionals working in hospital emergency departments (HEDs) and hospital emergency rooms (HERs) in Malopolska, a region in southern Poland. Methods: The following questionnaires were used in the study: the Cross-Cultural Competence Inventory (CCCI), the Cultural Intelligence Scale (CQS), and Questionnaire on Attitudes Towards Culturally Divergent People. In total, 709 medical professionals participated in the study, including 363 nurses, 223 paramedics, and 123 doctors. Results: Cultural intelligence-the overall score and the scores on the metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and behavioral subscales were significantly higher among HED and HER doctors. Cultural competencies-the overall score and the score on the cultural adaptation subscale were also significantly higher among HED and HER doctors. The CCCI and CQS scores were influenced by selected variables: taking care of and close interactions with representatives of other cultural circles; staying outside Poland for more than a month. Doctors were the group of medical professionals that were most tolerant and most positive towards people from other cultures. Conclusions: The research results confirm the positive impact of contact of medical professionals with people from other cultures on their cultural competencies and cultural intelligence. They indicate the need for training in acquiring cultural competencies and developing cultural intelligence, especially among nurses. They demonstrate the need to raise awareness among HED and HER medical professionals about issues in intercultural care and to increase diversity efforts, especially among nurses.",13,0,healthcare providers/healthcare professionals; emergency medical system; cultural competence; cultural intelligence; MODEL,Article

However, assessing and improving the cross-cultural competence of healthcare professionals is difficult in Japan, as there is no standardized scale to measure the competence. This study's purpose was to translate the Cross-Cultural Competence instrument for Healthcare Professionals (CCCHP), which was developed and used in Europe, and to examine its reliability and validity among Japanese nurses.MethodsDuring June and July 2021, nursing staff were invited to take web- and paper-based surveys in Okinawa Japan. The CCCHP (five-factor model with 27 items across motivation, attitude, skills, emotion, and knowledge) was translated using a combination translation method, and a five-point Likert scale was used for responses. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and known-group method were used to examine structural validity, while Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to test reliability.ResultsA total of 294 responses were analyzed; 77.2% had more than five years of experience. Since the fit index indicated that the five-factor model was not a good fit, it was modified to a four-factor model (J-CCCHP24) by moving three variables, removing the knowledge factor, and using the error covariance of the variables. The fit index after the modification was improved to comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.92, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = 0.91, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05, and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = 0.06, and Cronbach's alpha was 0.85. The mean scores of J-CCCHP24 were significantly higher in the group with a history of overseas travel, higher foreign language skill, training in intercultural care, experience of foreign patient care, and intercultural interactions outside the workplace than in the group without these characteristics.ConclusionThis study confirmed the validity and reliability of the modified Japanese version of the CCCHP (four-factor model with 24 items). The results suggest that the exposure to different cultures on a personal level may help improve nurses' cross-cultural competence. Further refinement of this scale for practical use would encourage the implementation of necessary countermeasures to improve the cross-cultural competence of Japanese healthcare professionals.",0,0,Cross-cultural competence; Japanese nurses; Psychometric properties; Scale validity and reliability; Multicultural care,Article

Such protocols are currently lacking in Poland. The Australian Palliative Care Outcome Collaboration (PCOC) concept of Palliative phases precisely defines patients, enables episodes of care extraction for benchmarking and further assessment of service delivery. The present study is aimed at developing cross-cultural adaptation and psychometric validation for a Polish translation of Palliative phases.MethodsForward and backward translation was performed to obtain a Polish draft version regarding definitions of the PCOC phases. The draft was then subjected to linguistic and graphical transformations in the process of cognitive interviewing. The acceptability of the Polish version was assessed based on staff perceptions of fit, ease of assignment and familiarity with the patient's and family's situation. Finally, cross-sectional analysis was conducted among 313 hospice and home-care palliative patients. The attending doctor and nurse independently evaluated the same patients using the Polish version of the PCOC phases to establish inter-rater reliability values. Then, to determine its construct validity, the PCOC indicators were referred to patients' prognosis, functioning level and PALCOM scale scores.ResultsA Polish draft version of the PCOC phases was prepared. Seven of the 13 interviewees reported problems with comprehending this proposal. This prompted changes being made to linguistic and graphical aspects of the tool. The majority of respondents preferred the final graphical scheme of phases, prepared after round-two of interviews. Scheme application acceptability was confirmed in a practical trial. The respondents' overall conviction regarding degree of fit and assignment ease was high. Seventy percent of PCOC phase assignments was in agreement, and a moderate level or inter-rater reliability was obtained (kappa 0.573). The highest proportion of totally bed-bound patients with the shortest survival prognosis was observed for the terminal phase, while the highest complexity of palliative care needs was noted for the unstable one.ConclusionsThe PCOC phases tool appears to be a valuable resource for specialists in palliative care settings to support audit measures. Practical training is recommended prior to its implementation in routine practice.",1,0,Palliative care phases; Palliative care; Cognitive interviewing; Outcome measurement; Quality of healthcare; ACCEPTABILITY; RELIABILITY,Article

However, significant racial/ethnic differences exist regarding acceptance of PGT contributing to disparities. Latinas (Latinx), one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States, have low PGT acceptance rates. This systematic scoping review aimed to provide a landscape of existing literature on Latinx individuals' knowledge of, preferences for, and experiences with prenatal and preconception genetic testing. Synthesizing the current state of the science may inform development of culturally tailored interventions to support high-quality PGT decisions (e.g., informed, aligned with a pregnant persons' values). Methods We conducted a structured, systematic literature search of published articles and gray literature in electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Medline, Embase, Eric, Social Services Abstracts, and PsycArticles). Articles in English published prior to March 2021 were retrieved relating to genetics, pregnancy, and Latina women. Articles underwent title, abstract and full-text review by independent investigators to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risk of bias was evaluated by two investigators. Iterative thematic analysis was employed to group study findings into themes to identify possible targets for interventions. Results The search generated 5511 unique articles. After title screening, 335 underwent abstract review and subsequently 61 full-text review. Twenty-eight studies met inclusion criteria and 7 additional studies were included after reviewing reference lists. Three overarching themes emerged: genetic knowledge/literacy (26/35, 74%), provider (mis)communication/patient satisfaction (21/35, 60%), and cross-cultural beliefs (12/35, 34%). Studies indicate discordant patient-provider language (n = 5), miscommunication (n = 4), and lack of concordant decision-making (n = 4) pose barriers to high-quality PGT decisions. Immigration status (n = 1) and religious beliefs (n = 5) are additional factors influencing PGT decisions. Conclusions Identified studies suggest that cultural and linguistic factors affect Latinx PGT decision-making. Latinx individual's comprehension and recall of PGT information is enhanced by culturally and linguistically concordant providers-suggesting that culturally-informed interventions may enhance PGT acceptability and support high-quality decisions. Future directions to surmount PGT disparities may include community health workers and cultural brokers to empower Latinx people to make informed decisions aligned with their values and preferences.",0,0,Health literacy; Genetic counseling; Genetic testing; Genomic healthcare; Genetic literacy; Attitudes; Prenatal testing; Latinx populations; DECISION-MAKING; DIAGNOSIS; WOMEN; PERCEPTIONS; INFORMATION; ETHNICITY; REASONS; HEALTH; CARE,Review

Access to hospital and specialist care frequently requires transport via road or air and time spent away from family and community. Question, hypothesis or aim: To explore consumer perspectives of the journey from remote communities to regional health services and identify areas for improvement. Methods: Individual interviews (n = 16) and yarning circles were used to collect and interpret stories of patient's journeys. Findings: Travel for medical care was common and often required multiple journeys. Complex social and financial barriers to accessing care included costs associated with travel, food, and accommodation for patients and their families, a lack of understanding of the process and requirements of retrieval, difficulty arranging own road transport, and lack of availability of services within the community. These barriers extend to difficulties in attending follow-up outpatient appointments and return to the community after a journey to the hospital. Discussion: Educational resources may also be used to describe the retrieval process to remote community members to demystify acute health care in Central Australia but also to express the health service commitment to quality improvement through consumer voice. These resources may be used to orientate new health service employees to patient experiences and perspectives so that these can be incorporated into care planning to enhance cross-cultural understanding. Conclusion: Travel to access healthcare is an essential component of health services for remote communities. Targeted education for residents on travel expectations and education for staff may significantly reduce barriers to healthcare access. (c) 2023 Australian College of Nursing Ltd.

Susceptibilities of older persons resulting from lower knowledge about services availability, health illiteracy, lower income, higher mental decline, or physical limitations need to be identified and monitored to assure the equity and quality of health care. The aim of this study was to develop equity indicators for the Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE)-3 checklist and perform the first cross-cultural adaptation and validation of this checklist into Portuguese. Methods A scoping literature review of determinants or indicators of health (in)equity in the care of older people was performed. A total of 5 language experts and 18 health professionals were involved in the development and validation of the equity and quality indicators through expert opinion and focus groups. Data collected from focus groups was analyzed through directed or conventional content analysis. The usefulness of the indicators was assessed by analyzing the clinical records of 30 patients. Results The literature review revealed that there was a worldwide gap concerning equity indicators for older people primary health care. A structured and complete checklist composed of equity and quality indicators was obtained, validated and assessed. A significant number of non-screened quality or equity related potential occurrences that could have been avoided if the proposed indicators were implemented were detected. The percentage of non-registered indicators was 76.6% for quality and 96.7% for equity.

Occupational MI has been studied mainly among military personnel and first responders and is linked to mental health problems. MI encompasses negative moral emotions such as shame, guilt, and anger leading to distress, and impairment in social and occupational functioning. The COVID-19 pandemic predisposed healthcare providers to moral dilemmas, potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs), and MI. We aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of MI in healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan.Materials and methodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in July-October 2021 among physician/clinician staff working at teaching hospitals in Lahore. The Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professionals (MISS-HP) was used to collect data. SPSS 26 was used for data analysis applying Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests on non-normally distributed data at alpha = 0.05. Predictors of MI were ascertained through Binary Logistic Regression analysis.ResultsFour hundred and twenty physicians responded to the questionnaires. The Median (IQR) MI scores were 37(28-47). Guilt, moral concerns, and shame were higher-scoring MI dimensions. 40.8% (n = 171) suffered from clinically significant distress and impaired functioning while 14.3% (n = 60) from severe distress. Gender, department, and history of psychiatric illness predicted higher levels of distress which were 1.9 times higher in females than males and 2.5 times higher with a history of psychiatric illness. Working on the front lines did not predict MI.ConclusionOur findings highlight the substantial burden of MI in our sample during COVID-19, having implications for healthcare providers' well-being, healthcare quality, and service delivery. This calls for concerted efforts from all stakeholders to better prepare for future disasters through effective human-resource policies, pre-trauma exposure soft-skills training, effective teamwork and communication strategies; self-stewardship and resilience modules, and mental health support for healthcare providers. The dimensional construct of MI may vary across cultures; hence we recommend further cross-cultural research on MI in healthcare providers, particularly in the context of public health disasters.",0,0,moral injury; Covid-19 pandemic; potentially morally injurious events; SARS-CoV 2 pandemic; healthcare providers; Pakistan,Article

Equity is conceptualized as the absence of differences in healthcare access and quality among population groups. Healthcare policies are guides for front-line practices, and despite merits of contemporary policies striving to foster equitable healthcare, inequities persist. The purpose of this umbrella review is to identify prenatal healthcare practices, summarize how equities/inequities are reported in relation to patient experiences or health outcomes when accessing or using services, and collate equity reporting characteristics.MethodsFor this umbrella review, six electronic databases were searched (Medline, EMBASE, APA PsychInfo, CINAHL, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, and Cochrane Library). Included studies were extracted for publication and study characteristics, equity reporting, primary outcomes (prenatal care influenced by equity/inequity) and secondary outcomes (infant health influenced by equity/inequity during pregnancy). Data was analyzed deductively using the PROGRESS-Plus equity framework and by summative content analysis for equity reporting characteristics. The included articles were assessed for quality using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Systematic Reviews.ResultsThe search identified 8065 articles and 236 underwent full-text screening. Of the 236, 68 systematic reviews were included with first authors representing 20 different countries. The population focus of included studies ranged across prenatal only (n = 14), perinatal (n = 25), maternal (n = 2), maternal and child (n = 19), and a general population (n = 8). Barriers to equity in prenatal care included travel and financial burden, culturally insensitive practices that deterred care engagement and continuity, and discriminatory behaviour that reduced care access and satisfaction. Facilitators to achieve equity included innovations such as community health workers, home visitation programs, conditional cash transfer programs, virtual care, and cross-cultural training, to enhance patient experiences and increase their access to, and use of health services. There was overlap across PROGRESS-Plus factors.ConclusionsThis umbrella review collated inequities present in prenatal healthcare services, globally. Further, this synthesis contributes to future solution and action-oriented research and practice by assembling evidence-informed opportunities, innovations, and approaches that may foster equitable prenatal health services to all members of diverse communities.",0,0,Prenatal; Antenatal; Pregnancy; Health services; Health equity; Inequity; Umbrella review; Review of reviews; PROGRESS-plus; CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFERS; MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES; SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; CONSOLIDATED FRAMEWORK; WOMENS EXPERIENCES; SEARCH STRATEGIES; BIRTH OUTCOMES; UNITED-KINGDOM; NEWBORN HEALTH; ANTENATAL CARE,Article
