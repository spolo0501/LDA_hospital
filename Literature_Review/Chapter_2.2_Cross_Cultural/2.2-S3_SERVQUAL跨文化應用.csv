In total, 31 potential Informational World Cities were identified and a set of criteria was developed to evaluate the degree of informativeness of a city through coherent criteria. The purpose of this paper is to investigate London.",1,0,Case studies; Knowledge workers; Information science; Information society; CITIES; MOBILITY,Article
A three-dimensional house: extending quality function deployment in two organizations,"Farokhnia, Moein; Beheshtinia, Mohammad Ali; EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD; Farokhnia, Moein; Beheshtinia, Mohammad Ali; Beheshtinia, Mohammad Ali; Beheshtinia, Mohammad; Beheshtinia, Mohammad Ali",2019,MANAGEMENT DECISION,10.1108/MD-06-2017-0588,WOS:000479233200009,Iran,"Purpose Nowadays, many organizations use quality function deployment (QFD) in order to recognize their customers' wants and arrange a set of corrective activities in order to satisfy these wants. In a competitive environment, two or more organizations cooperate in order to meet their customers' wants. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new hybrid approach of QFD employing SERVQUAL method, named three-dimensional house of quality (3DHOQ) to help the cooperation between two organizations with common customers by determining some common corrective activities that would satisfy their customers' wants. Design/methodology/approach In order to better explain the proposed model, it is implemented in Birjand International Airport and Iran Air airline. At first, the customers' want in the airport and airline sections are identified and the SERVQUAL method is used to determine the final weight of these wants. Afterwards, the corrective activities for satisfying the customers' wants are determined using the three-dimensional QDF; and then are given weights using the multi-dimensional relation matrix. Findings Results of this study show the customers' wants in two sections of airport and airline, the importance of each customer want, the gap between customers' perception and expectation of each want, the collective corrective activities required to satisfy the customers' wants and the weight of these corrective activities. Originality/value This paper presents a simultaneous QFD analysis in the airport and airline sections. Moreover, a new hybrid approach employing SERVQUAL method, named 3DHOQ is introduced to determine the corrective activities of both organizations and their weights.",1,0,SERVQUAL; Service quality; Cooperation; Fuzzy set theory; House of quality; QFD; AIRLINE SERVICE QUALITY; CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; MODEL; EXPECTATIONS; PERCEPTIONS,Article
Quality of Accreditation Services for Engineering Programs,"Lee, Lung-Sheng; Ko, Hui-Min; Wang, Mei-Tyng; TEMPUS PUBLICATIONS; Lee, Lung-Sheng; Ko, Hui-Min; Wang, Mei-Tyng; Ko, Hui-Min; Wang, Mei-Tyng; Wang, Mei-Tyng; Wang, Mei-Tyng",2017,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION,N/A,WOS:000410785900018,Taiwan,"Accreditation of degree-granting engineering programs has been conducted for a decade in Taiwan and has contributed to raising the quality of engineering education. While quality is closely linked to stakeholders' satisfaction, this study aimed to answer how the accreditation stakeholders consider the quality of accreditation services. We employed a PZB model comprising five service gaps and five constructs to analyse service quality, and surveyed 230 program supervisors that applied for accreditation (consumers) and 218 accreditation assessors (service providers). Consequently, the following gaps are found in the PZB (Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry) model: (1) There is a gap between the assessors' ""perceived consumer expectations'' and the program supervisors' ""expected services''; in particular, the two-group gaps on ""IEET accreditation increases graduates international recognition and generates substantial benefit'' and ""assessors show respect for others while undertaking their accreditation tasks'' are large. (2) There is a gap between the assessors' ""perceived service quality specification'' and ""the provision of service'' (i.e. Gap 3 exists); and the most influential construct is ""Reliability''. (3) There is a gap between the program supervisors' ""expected services'' and ""perceived services'' (i.e. Gap 5 exists); in particular, the two-side gaps on the ""IEET accreditation criteria reflect international trend'' and ""IEET reviews help programs improve the quality of education'' are large and it indicates that the quality of accreditation services have not yet met the expectations of the assessed programs. (4) Insufficient confidence in the reliability of accreditation criteria and the provision of services. The results can be used for reference to improve engineering program accreditation practices, especially under the Washington Accord, and the process of which this study employed can be used to examine the service quality of other institutional and program accreditation.",0,0,SERVQUAL scale; PZB model; service quality; program accreditation; meta-evaluation; HIGHER-EDUCATION; ABET ACCREDITATION; CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS; SERVQUAL SCALE; STUDENTS; UNIVERSITY; OUTCOMES; MODEL; IMPROVEMENT; TAIWAN,Article
A Cross-Cultural Perspective on the Blended Service Quality for Ride-Sharing Continuance,"Shiau, Wen-Lung; Chen, Hao; Chen, Kuanchin; Liu, Yi-Hung; Tan, Felix Ter Chian; IGI GLOBAL; Shiau, Wen-Lung; Chen, Hao; Chen, Kuanchin; Liu, Yi-Hung; Tan, Felix Ter Chian; Shiau, Wen-Lung; Shiau, Wen-Lung; Chen, Hao; Liu, Yi-Hung; Tan, Felix Ter Chian; Chen, Kuanchin; Shiau, Wen-Lung; Chen, Kuanchin",2021,JOURNAL OF GLOBAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT,10.4018/JGIM.287602,WOS:000715300800001,Peoples R China; USA; Taiwan; Australia,"This research aims to elucidate the service quality factors influencing customer satisfaction with ride-sharing services. Particularly, this research compares Chinese and US consumers to identify the influence of national culture on user attitudes. Empirical research was conducted via two online surveys in China and the US. Data were collected and analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) analysis. The results show that while the satisfaction of the Chinese ride-sharing consumers was affected primarily by reliability, followed by platform assurance and empathy, the satisfaction of American consumers was influenced mainly by the conditions of ride-sharing vehicles (tangibles). The PLS-MGA results indicate that satisfaction with ride-sharing services had a significantly stronger impact on American rather than on Chinese continuance intention.

Using SERVQUAL Method to Assess Tourist Service Quality by the Example of the Silesian Museum Established on the Post-Mining Area,"Kowalska, Natalia; Ostrega, Anna; MDPI; Kowalska, Natalia; Ostrega, Anna; Kowalska, Natalia; Ostrega, Anna; Kowalska, Natalia; Kowalska, Natalia",2020,LAND,10.3390/land9090333,WOS:000581995300001,Poland,"The increasing role of the tourism industry in the global economy and the growing competition makes it necessary to ensure constant performance and continually improve quality. The paper draws attention to the necessity of conducting research on tourist attraction quality also in post-industrial areas which have become attractive tourist sites. It is emphasised that industrial tourism is a new yet quickly developing phenomenon in Poland, which compels managers to differentiate their service range and improve quality standards. The paper employs the SERVQUAL (SERvice QUALity) method to assess the quality of tourist services as a theoretical instrument to measure overall visitor satisfaction. The subject of the research was the Silesian Museum, which is result of reclamation and revitalisation of the inactive ""Katowice"" Hard Coal Mine. The article presents an empirical verification of the methodology which was modified for the purposes of the research subject. The Museum is considered to be one of the most important cultural centres and a crucial element of the social life of the Silesia region where mining activity has been carried out for centuries. Thirty young people from different continents participated in the survey. The results demonstrated that the expectations of the visitors were not met in three cases only which suggests a very high quality of the Silesian Museum. Moreover, the presented results show increasing capabilities and opportunities to maintain a high quality of services in the studied facility. The findings indicate that the appropriately modified SERVQUAL methodology is a valuable and simple tool to evaluate visitor satisfaction. The results of the evaluation of the Silesian Museum services will be presented to the facility managers. Further research will be carried out after the improvement and implementation of the next stage of the Museum's development.",0,0,post-mining land use; industrial tourism; SERVQUAL method; SATISFACTION; MODEL; PERCEPTIONS; SCALE,Article
