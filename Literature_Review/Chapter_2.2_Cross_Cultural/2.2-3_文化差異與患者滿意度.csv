The aim of this study was to investigate the parental burden and possible intercultural differences of this treatment modality, which is often argued to burden parents to an extraordinary amount. Materials and methods Standardized questionnaires (available in English, Mandarin, and German) with 15 non-specific and 14 NAM-specific items to be retrospectively answered by Likert scales by parents of unilateral CLP patients with completed NAM treatment. Results The parents of 117 patients from two treatment centers in Taiwan and Germany were included. A very high level of overall satisfaction was found in both countries with significant intercultural differences in prenatal parent information, feeding problems, dealing with 3rd party's perception, and experienced personal effort. Conclusion NAM is an effective treatment tool for children's CLP deformities and their caregivers in overcoming the feeling of helplessness. Intercultural differences may be due to infrastructural reasons, cultural attitudes and habits, or different public medical education.",1,0,Nasoalveolar molding; Intercultural evaluation; Parental stress; Burden; Cleft lip palate; Questionnaire,Article
Hip Arthroscopy for Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome in High-Level Athletes: A 10-Year Follow-up,"Karlsson, Louise; Collberg, Olle; Erlandsson, David; Nikou, Sarantos; Baranto, Adad; Ohlin, Axel; Lindman, Ida; SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC; Karlsson, Louise; Collberg, Olle; Erlandsson, David; Nikou, Sarantos; Baranto, Adad; Ohlin, Axel; Lindman, Ida; Karlsson, Louise; Collberg, Olle; Erlandsson, David; Nikou, Sarantos; Baranto, Adad; Ohlin, Axel; Lindman, Ida; Karlsson, Louise; Collberg, Olle; Erlandsson, David; Nikou, Sarantos; Baranto, Adad; Ohlin, Axel; Lindman, Ida; Karlsson, Louise; Baranto, Adad; Ohlin, Axel; Nikou, Sarantos; Karlsson, Louise",2024,ORTHOPAEDIC JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE,10.1177/23259671241275657,WOS:001339848400001,Sweden,"Background: Arthroscopic treatment for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) has previously been reported to have favorable short-term results in high-level athletes. Less is known about long-term outcomes. Purpose: To report outcomes 10 years after hip arthroscopy for FAIS in high-level athletes using validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Patients who underwent hip arthroscopy between November 2011 and January 2013 were included in a local hip arthroscopy registry and completed preoperative PROMs. At 10-year follow-up, the same PROMs were completed. Inclusion criteria were age <40 years at time of surgery, no prior hip surgeries, and a pre-symptomatic Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS) level of 7 or 8. The exclusion criterion was total hip arthroplasty at follow-up. The PROMs included the international Hip Outcome Tool-12 items (iHOT-12), the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS), visual analog scale (VAS) for overall hip function, European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) and European Quality of Life-visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), HSAS, and a single question on patient satisfaction. The rates of patients achieving minimal important change and reporting Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) were reported for HAGOS and iHOT-12. For iHOT-12, preoperative results were compared with 1, 5, and 10-year follow-ups. Results: A total of 45 patients (34 men, 11 women; 70 hips; mean age 24.4 years at time of surgery) were included, with 77 patients eligible for inclusion. Significant improvements (P < .001) were seen at 10-year follow-up in all HAGOS subscales: Symptoms, Pain, Daily Activity, Sports, Physical Activity, Quality of Life (50.3 vs 78.6, 59.2 vs 86.8, 65.9 vs 88.8, 37.1 vs 81.1, 24.4 vs 81.1, 32.1 vs 79.3), iHOT-12 (40.1 vs 81.6), EQ-5D (0.59 vs 0.89), EQ-VAS (65.6 vs 80.4), and VAS for overall hip function (48 vs 79). For iHOT-12, the largest change was seen between preoperative and 1-year follow-up values, with consistent results over time. There was no statistically significant difference between HSAS levels preoperatively and at 10-year follow-up (HSAS level 4), with 24% of patients reporting a HSAS level 7 or 8 at the follow-up. Of the patients, 93% reported satisfaction with the surgery. PASS was achieved in 82% for iHOT-12, with a range of 76% to 91% for HAGOS subscales. Furthermore, 93% exceeded the minimal important change for iHOT-12, and a range of 67% to 84% for HAGOS. Conclusion: In a high-level athletic population, significant improvements in long-term outcomes are reported after hip arthroscopy for FAIS, with patients reporting a high satisfaction rate. The results also show that the largest improvement occurs within the first postoperative year, with results being maintained for 10 years.",2,0,hip; femoroacetabular impingement; hip arthroscopy; football (soccer); ice hockey; medical aspects of sports; athletes; patient-reported outcome measures; CROSS-CULTURAL ADAPTATION; CAM-TYPE DEFORMITY; PHYSICAL FUNCTION; GROIN DISABILITY; VALIDATION; PAIN; SYMPTOMS,Article

Humanistic nursing care, which emphasizes empathy, respect for individuality, and cultural sensitivity, aims to build trust and improve the overall experience for patients. This approach is especially relevant for rural patients in China, who often face additional challenges in accessing care in large tertiary hospitals.Methods A multistage, stratified sampling method was employed to collect data from 8,263 patients aged 18 years or older in large public tertiary hospitals. Humanistic care satisfaction scores were measured using the Nurse Caring Instrument (NCI) questionnaire, a validated tool for assessing patient satisfaction with nursing care.Results Satisfaction with nursing humanistic care among rural Chinese patients attending large tertiary public hospitals was low with the overall mean satisfaction score 81.62 +/- 16.85. Significant differences in satisfaction were found based on age, marital status, number of children, educational attainment, occupation, monthly household income, department visited, type of medical insurance, and first-time visitor. A multivariate analysis revealed positive correlations with satisfaction for factors such as having children, higher education, higher family monthly income, and first-time visitor, and negative correlations for factors such as older age, being widowed, department visited, and region.Conclusion Older adults, widowed individuals, and first-time patients expressed lower levels of satisfaction, highlighting the need for tailored interventions. The findings provide insights into the impact of humanistic nursing care for rural patients and emphasize the importance of culturally sensitive approaches to improve patient satisfaction in rural China. This study has several limitations. The cross-sectional design restricts the ability to establish causal relationships, and there is a potential for selection bias, as participants who completed the survey may have higher educational and economic levels, possibly leading to an overestimation of satisfaction. Lastly, as this study focused on rural patients in large public tertiary hospitals in China, the findings may not be generalizable to other settings or patient groups. Future studies should address these limitations for broader applicability and insight.",0,0,rural patients; humanistic nursing care; Chinese Public Tertiary Hospitals; patient satisfaction; cross-sectional study; SCIENCE; EXPERIENCE; OUTCOMES,Article
"Modest, yet progressive: Effective therapists tend to rate therapeutic change less positively than their patients","Ziem, Max; Hoyer, Juergen; ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD; Ziem, Max; Hoyer, Juergen; Hoyer, Juergen; Hoyer, Juergen; Ziem, Max; Hoyer, Juergen",2020,PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH,10.1080/10503307.2019.1631502,WOS:000475272800001,Germany,"Objective: Empirical findings on self-serving biases amongst psychotherapists are inconsistent. We tested in a large naturalistic data set, if therapists are prone to illusory superiority when estimating their patients' outcome and whether this effect is buffered by therapists' effectiveness. Method: A post-hoc analysis with N = 69 therapists, who treated N = 1080 patients, was conducted. Therapists' and patients' mean ratings for therapeutic improvement in the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) were compared. Using a multilevel modelling approach, we further investigated the relation between the patient-therapist divergence in the CGI and actual therapeutic change in the Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory and in the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Results: Ratings in the CGI did not show significant differences between patients' and therapists' assessment of therapeutic change. Lower estimations by therapists, compared to patients' self-report, were associated with greater therapeutic change in GSI and SWLS. Conclusions: Therapists, on a whole, did not seem to be prone to illusory superiority when assessing therapeutic outcome. Contrary, the more modest the therapists' estimation of therapeutic outcome was, the greater the actual therapeutic change.",0,0,psychotherapy research; self-assessment; therapeutic outcome; illusory superiority; therapist performance; FACILITATIVE INTERPERSONAL SKILLS; BRIEF SYMPTOM INVENTORY; MENTAL-HEALTH; SELF-ASSESSMENT; CULTURAL-DIFFERENCES; OWN INCOMPETENCE; PSYCHOTHERAPY; ALLIANCE; EXPERTISE; CLINICIAN,Article

"""I Treat Him as a Normal Patient"": Unveiling the Normalization Coping Strategy Among Formal Caregivers of Persons With Dementia and Its Implications for Person-Centered Care","Bentwich, Miriam Ethel; Dickman, Nomy; Oberman, Amitai; Bokek-Cohen, Ya'arit; SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC; Bentwich, Miriam Ethel; Dickman, Nomy; Oberman, Amitai; Bokek-Cohen, Ya'arit; Bokek-Cohen, Ya'arit; Bentwich, Miriam Ethel",2018,JOURNAL OF TRANSCULTURAL NURSING,10.1177/1043659617745137,WOS:000441722100004,Israel,"Introduction: Currently, 47 million people have dementia, worldwide, often requiring paid care by formal caregivers. Research regarding family caregivers suggests normalization as a model for coping with negative emotional outcomes in caring for a person with dementia (PWD). The study aims to explore whether normalization coping mechanism exists among formal caregivers, reveal differences in its application among cross-cultural caregivers, and examine how this coping mechanism may be related to implementing person-centered care for PWDs. Method: Content analysis of interviews with 20 formal caregivers from three cultural groups (Jews born in Israel [JI], Arabs born in Israel [AI], Russian immigrants [RI]), attending to PWDs. Results: We extracted five normalization modes, revealing AI caregivers had substantially more utterances of normalization expressions than their colleagues. Discussion: The normalization modes most commonly expressed by AI caregivers relate to the personhood of PWDs. These normalization modes may enhance formal caregivers' ability to employ person-centered care.",0,0,formal caregivers; coping strategy; dementia; normalization; person-centered care; personhood; PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OLDER-ADULTS; PEOPLE; MODERNIZATION; SATISFACTION; RESEARCHERS; FRAMEWORK; HEALTH; IMPACT,Article
