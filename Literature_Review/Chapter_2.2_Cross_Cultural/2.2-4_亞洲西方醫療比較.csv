South Asian patients' perceptions and experiences of compassion in healthcare,"Singh, Pavneet; King-Shier, Kathryn; Sinclair, Shane; ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD; Singh, Pavneet; King-Shier, Kathryn; Sinclair, Shane; Singh, Pavneet; Sinclair, Shane; King-Shier, Kathryn; Sinclair, Shane; Sinclair, Shane; Sinclair, Shane",2020,ETHNICITY & HEALTH,10.1080/13557858.2020.1722068,WOS:000513463600001,Canada,"Background: South Asians are one of the fastest growing ethnic populations in Western countries. Accordingly, providing culturally sensitive healthcare to South Asians is becoming increasingly important. Compassion is a key component of quality healthcare and is central to bridging ethnic and cultural differences between patients and their healthcare providers (HCP). Objective: We aimed to identify and describe the perspectives, experiences, importance, and impact of compassion among South Asian patients. Methods: Straussian grounded theory was used to examine the perspectives of South Asians patients who had recent experience(s) with the Canadian healthcare system. A convenience sample of 19 South Asian participants underwent semi-structured audio-recorded interviews in either English, Hindi, or Punjabi. Transcribed interview data were analyzed using constant comparison. Results: Three categories were generated from the data: (1) South Asians' understandings of compassion, (2) HCPs' cultural sensitivity as an indicator of compassion, and (3) enhancing compassion: importance and patient recommendations for overcoming barriers to compassion. The first category included themes exploring South Asian patients' perspectives of compassion. The second category was divided into themes which examined how delivery and receipt of compassion can be influenced by ethnic and cultural differences between patients and HCPs. The third category consisted of themes highlighting participants' views on the importance of compassion, recommendations for overcoming language and cultural barriers to providing compassion, and the role of compassion in bridging language, culture and ethnic differences between patients and HCPs. Conclusion: Compassion was described as a universal concept that is interpreted through the cultural and ethnic background of the recipient and provider in the way it is perceived, enacted, and received. This information can aid HCP to modulate compassion to South Asian patients and may provide a foundation for future studies on compassion within other cultural groups.",15,0,South Asians; culturally-sensitive care; compassion; compassionate care; PALLIATIVE CARE; NURSING-CARE; OF-LIFE; SATISFACTION; SIMILARITIES; PERSPECTIVE; RECIPROCITY; BARRIERS; CULTURES; DIGNITY,Article
Understanding the Best Nutritional Management for Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Patients: A Comparison Between East Asian and Western Experiences,"Perna, Alessia; Santoro, Massimo; Colaizzo, Elisa; MDPI; Perna, Alessia; Santoro, Massimo; Colaizzo, Elisa; Perna, Alessia; Santoro, Massimo; Colaizzo, Elisa",2024,LIFE-BASEL,10.3390/life14111496,WOS:001365635100001,Italy,"(1) Background: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by the accumulation of an altered prion protein, which usually leads to death within one year after clinical onset. CJD patients usually present with rapid cognitive impairment associated with declines in cerebellar, motor, visual, behavioral, and swallowing functions. Moreover, CJD patients lose their ability to eat and take medications orally very early on in treatment; nevertheless, there are no specific nutritional guidelines for this disease shared worldwide. (2) Methods: This review aims to describe the nutritional outcomes of CJD patients in Western countries to compare them with those described in East Asian countries and then aims to explore the most recent trends in the nutritional management of CJD patients, including some dietary compounds that present neuroprotective effects. (3) Results: In Japan's, Taiwan's, and China's healthcare systems, CJD patients receive intensive life-sustaining treatment that prolongs their survival (i.e., artificial feeding); conversely, in Western countries, intensive life-sustaining treatments like tube feeding are not commonly provided to CJD patients. (4) Conclusions: It is difficult to pinpoint the reasons for these discrepancies around CJD palliative care supply, but it is clear that specific nutritional guidelines may directly improve the nutritional management of CJD patients and thus allow their families and caregivers to ensure the best end-of-life care for these patients.",0,0,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; prion disease; artificial feeding; tube feed; gastrostomy; nutrition management; PERCUTANEOUS ENDOSCOPIC GASTROSTOMY; SWALLOWING FUNCTION; PREVENTION; PREDICTORS; SURVIVAL; CARE,Review
"How Acculturation Influences Attitudes about Advance Care Planning and End-of-Life Care among Chinese Living in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia","Chiang, Fu-Ming; Wang, Ying-Wei; Hsieh, Jyh-Gang; MDPI; Chiang, Fu-Ming; Wang, Ying-Wei; Hsieh, Jyh-Gang; Wang, Ying-Wei; Hsieh, Jyh-Gang; Hsieh, Jyh-Gang; Hsieh, Jyh-Gang; Wang, Ying Wei; CHIANG, FUMING",2021,HEALTHCARE,10.3390/healthcare9111477,WOS:000729303200001,Taiwan,"Background: Understanding attitudes towards life and death issues in different cultures is critical in end-of-life care and the uptake of advance care planning (ACP) in different countries. However, existing research suffers from a lack of cross-cultural comparisons among countries. By conducting this comparative study, we hope to achieve a clear understanding of the linkages and differences among healthcare cultures in different Chinese societies, which may serve as a reference for promoting ACP by considering cultural differences. Methods: Our researchers recruited Chinese adults who could communicate in Mandarin and lived in metropolitan areas in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia. Focus group interviews were conducted, and the interview contents were recorded and subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Between June and July 2017, 14 focus groups with 111 participants were conducted in four regions. With traditional Chinese attitudes towards death as a taboo, many participants felt it would be challenging to discuss ACP with elderly family members. Most participants also desire to avoid suffering for the self and family members. Although the four regions' participants shared a similar Chinese cultural context, significant regional differences were found in the occasions at which participants would engage in end-of-life discussions and select settings for end-of-life care. By contrast, participants from Singapore and Australia exhibited more open attitudes. Most participants from Taiwan and Hong Kong showed a preference for end-of-life care at a hospital. Conclusions: The developmental experiences of ACP in Western countries, which place a strong emphasis on individual autonomy, cannot be directly applied to family-centric Asian ones. Healthcare professionals in Asian societies should make continuous efforts to communicate patient status to patients and their family members to ensure family involvement in decision-making processes.",0,0,advance care planning; culture; cross culture research; DEATH; AMERICANS; JAPANESE; HEALTH; HOME,Article

In comparison to the native population, the prevalence is significantly higher and the prevalence of CVD risk factors is increasing rapidly. The cardiovascular risk profile and 10-year risk scores of South Asian descendants were evaluated in two cohorts with a 10-year time difference. Methods Two cross-sectional studies, conducted in 2004 and 2014, focused on asymptomatic South Asian descendants aged 18-59 years were performed. A short questionnaire, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, and nonfasting blood tests were obtained. The cohort of 2014 was matched with the cohort of 2004, based on age, gender, and family history of CVD. Results In 2014, 674 South Asians (44% men, age 38.2 +/- 12.0 years) were matched with 674 South Asians (44% men, age 38.3 +/- 12.1 years) included in 2004. Notably, hypertension prevalence decreased significantly in 2014 (10.6% vs 23.1% in 2004, P < 0.001), while mean BMI increased (26.1 vs 24.9, P < 0.001). The mean Framingham risk score was lower in 2014 (5.31 +/- 6.19%) than in 2004 (6.45 +/- 8.02%, P < 0.05). Conclusion This study demonstrates that South Asian descendants in 2014 have a lower but still high absolute risk for coronary events compared to 2004. Important differences in cardiovascular risk profile exist. Despite improvements, South Asian descendants in 2014 still face a high absolute risk for coronary events compared to 2004, indicating the necessity for continued primary prevention and lifestyle interventions.",0,0,cardiovascular risk; coronary artery disease; Framingham risk score; South Asians; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; BODY-MASS INDEX; LOW-DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN; MORTALITY; INDIANS; ETHNICITY; EXPLAIN; CHINESE; BRENT; FAT,Article

It is yet unclear whether MS disease characteristics and clinical course differ amongst Asian racial groups. Singapore is uniquely poised to investigate this as its multi-racial population comprises three genetically diverse Asian racial groups-Chinese, Malay and South Asian. Herein, we sought to elucidate differences in the clinical phenotypes, disease-modifying therapy (DMT) usage, and disease course amongst these three Asian racial groups by performinga retrospective observational study on MS patients seen at the National Neuroscience Institute, Singapore. Data on demographics, disease characteristics, ancillary investigations, and DMT usage were collected. One hundred and eighty-eight patients were included (90 Chinese, 32 Malay, and 66 South Asian). Our findings showed that MS prevalence was the highest in South Asians followed by Malays and Chinese, while demographics, healthcare access, and longer-term disease course were identical across the racial groups. However, several differences and trends were elucidated: (1) South Asian patients had milder sentinel attacks (p = 0.006), (2) a higher proportion of Malay patients had enhancing lesions on their initial MRI (p = 0.057) and the lesion topography differed across the races (p = 0.034), and (3) more Malay patients switched out of their initial DMT (p = 0.051). In conclusion, MS disease characteristics were largely similar across these three Asian racial groups, and while there were some clinical and radiological differences at presentation, these did not influence longer-term outcomes.",0,0,DISABILITY; PREVALENCE; CONVERSION; THERAPY,Article

The objectives of our study were to evaluate the effect of race/ ethnicity on access to acute stroke care and treatments and outcomes. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled adult patients admitted to the emergency department of a comprehensive stroke center for suspected stroke. Based on race/ethnicity, patients were divided into two main groups: Western European Whites (WEW) and non-Western European Whites (nWEW). We also divided the nWEW group into four subgroups based on the Office of Management and Budget classification of human races and ethnicities (White-Others, Hispanic, Asian, Black). Univariate comparisons and logistic regression analyses were also performed. Results: 9167 patients were enrolled in the study: 582 in the nWEW and 8585 in the WEW group. Patients with ischemic stroke in the nWEW group were significantly younger than those in the other group (p < 0.001). Once adjusted for possible confounders, belonging to the nWEW group was found to be an independent predictor of a lower likelihood of receiving revascularization treatments (p = 0.006), regardless similar onset-to-door times. There were no differences in stroke outcomes and prevalence of stroke mimic diagnosis between the groups. Conclusions: Racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare represent a challenging issue, even in universal healthcare systems, that should be addressed promptly through education campaigns of healthcare personnel and implementation measures, such as integrating readily available interpreter staff for medical emergencies.",0,0,Stroke care access; Acute stroke treatments; Racial inequalities; Ethnicity; Revascularization treatments; RACE/ETHNICITY; DISPARITIES; OUTCOMES; RACE,Article

Although HTA was identified as an important prioritization tool when adding new technologies to benefit packages, it is used inconsistently in the region, resulting in a less transparent decision-making process for stakeholders. Although regional challenges exist around real-world data (RWD), including a lack of capacity to enable information and data sharing, most policy or funding decision makers in the region have access to data. However, there appears to be a disconnect with the experience of industry, whose representatives identify the lack of RWD as their primary issue. To overcome these issues, both HTA agencies and industry agree that collaboration and transparency should be fostered to support the development of robust evidence generation in the region.Conclusions:There is a willingness for HTA agencies and industry to collaborate to develop HTA methodology for the prioritization of technologies in the Asia region that support healthcare systems to achieve the ultimate outcome of UHC.",0,0,Universal coverage; Patient generated health data; Technology assessment; Health; Decision making; FAIR CHOICES; COVERAGE; PATH,Article

Objective To describe medicine-related problems (MRPs) experienced by SA and ME patients from their perspectives and identify possible contributory factors that may be specific to their cultures. Setting The data were collected in seven pharmacies in London, United Kingdom (UK). Method The study was a qualitative study. Patients were from SA and ME origins, aged over 18 and prescribed three or more regular medicines. Patients were identified when presenting with a prescription. The data were collected in 80 face-to-face semi-structured interviews using Gordon's MRPs tool. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically using Gordon's coding frame and Nvivo 10 software. Main outcome measure Describing MRPs experienced by SA and ME patients from their perspectives and identifying possible contributory factors that may be specific to their cultures. Results Eighty participants (61 % male) had mean (SD) age 58 (13.4) years and a mean (SD) of 8 (4) medicines. Interviews revealed that several factors contributed to the development of MRPs; some appeared to be specific to SA and ME cultures and others were similar to the general population. The factors that were reported to be specific to SA and ME groups comprised religious practices and beliefs, use of non-prescription medicines, extent of family support, and travelling abroad-to patient's homeland or to take religious journeys. Illiteracy, language and communication barriers, lack of translated resources, perceptions of healthcare providers, and difficulty consulting a doctor of the same gender may also contribute to the problems. Many of these factors could be expected to influence patient's safety, adherence, and informed decision-making. Conclusion This study demonstrated that SA and ME patients have their own problems and needs regarding both medicine use and service access. By uncovering particular problems experienced by these groups, the study can inform healthcare professionals to support SA and ME patients in the use of their medicines.",0,0,Drug-related problems; Ethnic minorities; Ethnicity; Medication errors; Medication-related problems; Medicine use; Patient perspective; Primary care; United Kingdom; ACCESS; IDENTIFICATION; MANAGEMENT; BARRIERS; CARE,Article
