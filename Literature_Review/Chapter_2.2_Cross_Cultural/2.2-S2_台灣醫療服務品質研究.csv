Effect of internal marketing on knowledge sharing and organisational effectiveness in the hotel industry,"Yang, Jen-Te; ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD; Yang, Jen-Te",2015,TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT & BUSINESS EXCELLENCE,10.1080/14783363.2012.661131,WOS:000346262600007,Taiwan,"The purpose of this empirical study was to examine and justify the concept that knowledge management needs to be brought into the internal marketing (IM) field, and to investigate how communication media affect knowledge sharing (KS) and organisational effectiveness (OE). This empirical research concerns 499 usable questionnaires from employees of globally managed or franchised hotels in Taiwan. Structural equation modelling results show that the communication media of IM campaigns - conversation - significantly affected KS. This enables front-line employees to provide the right company offerings to external customers at their first encounter. Furthermore, it contributes to the reinforcement of employee competencies and enhances the quality of customer service during the service encounter and, thus, can provide a sustained advantage in market competitiveness and OE.",0,0,organisational effectiveness; internal marketing; communication media; knowledge sharing; SERVICE QUALITY; CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; NETWORKS; DELIVERY,Article

The present review explored the impact, diagnosis, prevention and management of sarcopenia in surgical and trauma patients. Recent evidence suggests that there are many factors contributing to its development other than age. Pathophysiology of sarcopenia is complex which makes its diagnosis difficult and there is no universal approach. It is a predictor of poor outcomes including post-operative complications, length of hospital stay and mortality in trauma and surgery patients. Sedentary lifestyle, age-dependent hormone and cytokine imbalance, decreased protein synthesis and regeneration, and motor unit remodelling are some of the main risk factors for sarcopenia. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, bio-electrical impedance analysis and computed tomography are frequently utilized for its diagnosis. Management of sarcopenia involves appropriate management of comorbidities, interventions to facilitate physical activities, nutrition interventions and pharmacotherapy.

International neonatal networks, along with patient registries of premature infants, have contributed to improving the quality of neonatal care; however, the involvement of low-to-middle-income countries was limited. This project aims to form an international collaboration among neonatal networks in Asia (AsianNeo), including low-, middle- and high-income countries (or regions). Specifically, it aims to determine outcomes in sick newborn infants, especially very low birth weight (VLBW) infants or very preterm infants, with a view to improving the quality of care for such infants. Methods and analysis Currently, AsianNeo comprises nine neonatal networks from Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan and Thailand. AsianNeo will undertake the following four studies: (1) institutional questionnaire surveys investigating neonatal intensive care unit resources and the clinical management of sick newborn infants, with a focus on VLBW infants (nine countries/regions); (2) a retrospective cohort study to describe and compare the outcomes of VLBW infants among Asian countries and regions (four countries/regions); (3) a prospective cohort study to develop the AsianNeo registry of VLBW infants (six countries/regions); and (4) implementation and evaluation of educational and quality improvement projects in AsianNeo countries and regions (nine countries/regions). Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan (reference number 2020-244, 2022-156). The study findings will be disseminated through educational programmes, quality improvement activities, conference presentations and medical journal publications.",0,0,Mortality; Neonatal intensive & critical care; NEONATOLOGY; International health services; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; PREMATURE-INFANTS; PRETERM INFANTS; MORBIDITY; MORTALITY; CANADA; TRENDS; DEATH,Article
What Motivates People to Adopt Personal Health Record?

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and changes imposed by the government on the population enhanced the disparities among citizens' ability to access healthcare. Thus, the purpose of this study was to provide an operating mechanism for understanding the effects of COVID-19 on individuals' PHR adoption intention based on an extended research model, including the Innovation and Diffusion Theory and Technology Acceptance Model. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the research model, using 390 valid responses from Taiwan. Findings indicated relative advantage, compatibility, ease of use, and personal innovativeness significantly influence perceived usefulness. Second, relative advantage, compatibility, ease of use, personal innovativeness, and perceived threat of COVID-19 significantly affect attitude toward PHR. Third, perceived usefulness and attitude positively influence PHR adoption intention. The current study provides policymakers insight into how Taiwanese individuals' psychological, technological, and pandemic-related threat affect their willingness to use the PHR system during the pandemic to receive better care that could eventually improve their quality of life.",0,0,Personal health record (PHR); perceived threat of COVID-19; innovation diffusion theory; technology acceptance model; personal innovativeness; TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE MODEL; PERCEIVED USEFULNESS; COVID-19; INTERVENTIONS; PROFESSIONALS; SYSTEM; READY; EASE,Article

Methods The present cross-sectional population-representative Internet-based study investigated OAB symptoms in men and women aged >= 40 years using the overactive bladder symptom score. Additional instruments included the International Index of Erectile Function (men only) and the Sexual Quality of Life - Female (women only) questionnaires, as well as Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC). Results In all, 8284 individuals participated in the study. The prevalence of OAB was 20.8% overall (women 22.1%, men 19.5%) and increased significantly with age, from 10.8% in those aged 40-44 years to 27.9% in those aged >60 years (P = .001). The presence of comorbid conditions (e.g. neurological disease, diabetes) was associated with a significantly increased prevalence of OAB. Increasing symptom severity was associated with significantly worsening patient perception of bladder condition responses. Just under half (48%) of those with no OAB had no lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), whereas 88% of those with severe symptoms had all 3 LUTS (International Continence Society definition) symptom categories (voiding, post-micturition, and storage symptoms). Of those without OAB, 10% reported visiting healthcare professionals for urinary symptoms, compared with 64% of those with severe OAB symptoms (P = .001). Increased symptom severity was significantly associated with lower sexual quality of life in both men and women. Conclusions OAB symptoms were found to affect 1 in 5 individuals aged >= 40 years in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, becoming more common with increasing age. The results suggest that many more individuals with OAB could benefit by consulting healthcare professionals.",0,0,China; overactive bladder; prevalence; Republic of Korea; Taiwan; URINARY-TRACT SYMPTOMS; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; RISK-FACTORS; QUESTIONNAIRE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; VALIDATION; PERCEPTION; COMMUNITY; HEALTH; SCALE,Article

Sample data of 741 patients in central Taiwan hospitals were analyzed, and the results of structural equation modeling showed that DDIs and time availability positively affect patient trust, which, in turn, positively influenced patient satisfaction and cooperation between patients and clinical pharmacists.
