    "abstract": "This paper proposes a method to assist patients in finding the most appropriate doctor for online medical consultation. To do that, it constructs an online doctor selection decision-making method that considers the correlation attributes, in which the measure of attribute correlation is derived from the history real decision data. To combine public and personal preference with correlated attributes, it proposes a Choquet integral based comprehensive online doctor ranking method. In detail, a two stage classification model based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is used to extract service features from unstructured text reviews. Then, 2-additive fuzzy measure is adopted to represent the patient public group aggregated attribute preference. Next, a novel optimization model is proposed to combine the public preference and personal preference. Finally, a case study of dxy.com is carried out to illustrate the procedure of the method. The comparison result between proposed method and other traditional MADM (multi-attribute decision-making) methods prove its rationality.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel technique termed as optimized swarm search-based feature selection (OS-FS), which is a swarm-type of searching function that selects an ideal subset of features for enhanced classification accuracy. In terms of gaining insights from unstructured medical based texts, sentiment prediction is becoming an increasingly crucial machine learning technique. In fact, due to its robustness and accuracy, it recently gained popularity in the medical industries. Medical text mining is well known as a fundamental data analytic for sentiment prediction. To form a high-dimensional sparse matrix, a popular preprocessing step in text mining is employed to transform medical text strings to word vectors. However, such a sparse matrix poses problems to the induction of accurate sentiment prediction model. The swarm search in our proposed OS-FS can be optimized by a new feature evaluation technique called clustering-by-coefficient-of-variation. In order to find a subset of features from all the original features from the sparse matrix, this type of feature selection has been a commonly utilized dimensionality reduction technique, and has the capability to improve accuracy of the prediction model. We implement this method based on a case scenario where 279 medical articles related to meaningful use functionalities on health care quality, safety, and efficiency' from a systematic review of previous medical IT literature. For this medical text mining, a multi-class of sentiments, positive, mixed-positive, neutral and negative is recognized from the document contents. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of OS-FS over traditional feature selection methods in literature.",

    "abstract": "To reach large groups of vaccine recipients, several high-income countries introduced mass vaccination centers for COVID-19. Understanding user experiences of these novel structures can help optimize their design and increase patient satisfaction and vaccine uptake. This study drew on user online reviews of vaccination centers to assess user experience and identify its key determinants over time, by sentiment, and by interaction. Machine learning methods were used to analyze Google reviews of six COVID-19 mass vaccination centers in Berlin from December 2020 to December 2021. 3647 user online reviews were included in the analysis. Of these, 89% (3261/3647) were positive according to user rating (four to five of five stars). A total of 85% (2740/3647) of all reviews contained text. Topic modeling of the reviews containing text identified five optimally latent topics, and keyword extraction identified 47 salient keywords. The most important themes were organization, friendliness/responsiveness, and patient flow/wait time. Key interactions for users of vaccination centers included waiting, scheduling, transit, and the vaccination itself. Keywords connected to scheduling and efficiency, such as \"appointment\" and \"wait\", were most prominent in negative reviews. Over time, the average rating score decreased from 4.7 to 4.1, and waiting and duration became more salient keywords. Overall, mass vaccination centers appear to be positively perceived, yet users became more critical over the one-year period of the pandemic vaccination campaign observed. The study shows that online reviews can provide real-time insights into newly set-up infrastructures, and policymakers should consider their use to monitor the population's response over time.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Use of both in-person and video visits have become a common norm in health care delivery, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative to understand how patients feel about their providers and their experiences during in-person and video visits. This study examines the important factors that patients use in their reviews and differences in the relative importance.Methods: We performed sentiment analysis and topic modeling on online physician reviews from April 2020 to April 2022. Our dataset comprised 34,824 reviews posted by patients after completing in-person or video visits.Results: Sentiment analysis yielded 27,507 (92.69%) positive and 2,168 (7.31%) negative reviews for in-person visits, and 4,610 (89.53%) positive and 539 (10.47%) negative reviews for video visits. Topic modeling identified seven factors patients used in their reviews: Bedside manners, Medical Expertise, Communication, Visit Environment, Scheduling and Follow-up, Wait times, and Costs and insurance. Patients who gave positive reviews after in-person consultations more frequently mentioned communication, office environment and staff, and bedside manners. Those who gave negative reviews after in-person visits mentioned longer wait times, providers' office and staff, medical expertise, and costs and insurance problems. Patients with positive reviews after video visits emphasized communication, bedside manners, and medical expertise. However, patients posting negative reviews after video visits frequently mentioned problems with appointment scheduling and follow-up, medical expertise, wait times, costs and insurance, and technical problems in video visits.Conclusions: This study identified key factors that influence patients' assessment of their providers in in-person and video visits. Paying attention to these factors can help improve the overall patient experience.",

    "abstract": "Background Evaluating patients' experiences is essential when incorporating the patients' perspective in improving healthcare. Experiences are mainly collected using closed-ended questions, although the value of open-ended questions is widely recognized. Natural language processing (NLP) can automate the analysis of open-ended questions for an efficient approach to patient-centeredness. Methods We developed the Artificial Intelligence Patient-Reported Experience Measures (AI-PREM) tool, consisting of a new, open-ended questionnaire, an NLP pipeline to analyze the answers using sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and a visualization to guide physicians through the results. The questionnaire and NLP pipeline were iteratively developed and validated in a clinical context. Results The final AI-PREM consisted of five open-ended questions about the provided information, personal approach, collaboration between healthcare professionals, organization of care, and other experiences. The AI-PREM was sent to 867 vestibular schwannoma patients, 534 of which responded. The sentiment analysis model attained an F1 score of 0.97 for positive texts and 0.63 for negative texts. There was a 90% overlap between automatically and manually extracted topics. The visualization was hierarchically structured into three stages: the sentiment per question, the topics per sentiment and question, and the original patient responses per topic. Conclusions The AI-PREM tool is a comprehensive method that combines a validated, open-ended questionnaire with a well-performing NLP pipeline and visualization. Thematically organizing and quantifying patient feedback reduces the time invested by healthcare professionals to evaluate and prioritize patient experiences without being confined to the limited answer options of closed-ended questions.",

This paper introduces a model for detecting cancer patients' opinions about healthcare services in the Persian language, both positive and negative.MethodTo achieve the objectives of this study, a combination of sentiment analysis (SA) and topic modeling approaches was employed. All pertinent comments made by cancer patients were collected from the patient feedback form of the Tehran University of Medical Science (TUMS) Cancer Institute (CI) in Iran, from March to October 2021. Conventional evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure were utilized to assess the performance of the proposed model.ResultThe experimental findings revealed that the proposed SA model achieved accuracies of 89.3%, 92.6%, and 90.8% in detecting patients' sentiments towards general services, healthcare services, and life expectancy, respectively. Based on the topic modeling results, the topic \"Metastasis\" exhibited lower sentiment scores compared to other topics. Additionally, cancer patients expressed dissatisfaction with the current appointment booking service, while topics such as \"Good experience,\" \"Affable staff\", and \"Chemotherapy\" garnered higher sentiment scores.ConclusionThe combined use of SA and topic modeling offers valuable insights into healthcare services. Policymakers can utilize the knowledge obtained from these topics and associated sentiments to enhance patient satisfaction with cancer institution services.",

    "abstract": "Measures of satisfaction following treatment for aphasia have been limited. The challenge associated with reduced verbal output among many persons with aphasia (PWA) has reportedly been a key reason measures of treatment satisfaction have been limited. A novel approach to measure treatment satisfaction is the use of content analysis (CA), which uses the presence of certain words, themes, or concepts to explore outcomes such as treatment satisfaction particularly among individuals who generate limited output. CA utilizes responses and response patterns to assign meaning to client responses. The aim of this study was to use CA to measure posttreatment satisfaction with a telepractice approach for aphasia treatment. Seventeen PWA received 12 treatment sessions over a 6-week period. At the conclusion of the treatment, CA was utilized to explore patient satisfaction with this treatment approach. The participants reported an overall positive sentiment for the telepractice approach. Two primary topics emerged which were healthcare provider and healthcare delivery, where text analysis revealed discussion of these topics to be centered around being \"helpful\" and \"being effective.\" This study demonstrated that CA can be an effective approach for determining satisfaction with aphasia treatment particularly among PWA with limited verbal abilities.",

    "abstract": "A large volume of patients? opinions?as online doctor reviews (ODRs)?are available online in order to access, analyze, and improve patients? perceptions about the quality of care; however, this development needs to be explored further. Drawing on the two-factor theory, this paper aims to mine ODRs to explore the different determinants of patient satisfaction (PS) and patient dissatisfaction (PD) toward the United Kingdom healthcare services. This study collects reviews from a publicly available medical website Iwantgreatcare.org from January 2014 to December 2018, followed by the text mining method based on combining SentiNet and LDA to disclose the semantics of patients? healthcare experiences. The proposed method found latent topics across the high-risk and low-risk disease category that revealed new insights into what patients value when consulting a physician and what they dislike. For high-risk and low-risk diseases, the determinants of PS were more specific to the hospital business process (hospital environment, location, hospital cafeteria servicescape, parking availability, and medical process, etc.) and doctor-related aspects (physician knowledge, competence, and attitudes, etc.). In contrast, patients? concerns were most commonly related to their treatment experience and staff bedside manners for both disease categories. Finally, the classification results revealed that the proposed model, which analyzes patient opinion toward different aspects of care, outperformed other stateof-the-art models, with the highest classification F1-score of 88%. The study findings provide a clue for doctors, hospitals, and government officials to enhance PS and minimize PD by addressing their needs and improve the quality of care across different types of diseases, particularly in the current pandemic era of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients have sought medical advice on online medical platforms. Review data have become an essential reference point for supporting users in selecting doctors. As the research object, this study considered , a well-known e-consultation website in China.Methods: This study examines the topics and sentimental change rules of user review texts from a temporal perspective. We also compared the topics and sentimental change characteristics of user review texts before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. First, 323,519 review data points about 2,122 doctors on were crawled using Python from 2017 to 2022. Subsequently, we employed the latent Dirichlet allocation method to cluster topics and the ROST content mining software to analyze user sentiments. Second, according to the results of the perplexity calculation, we divided text data into five topics: diagnosis and treatment attitude, medical skills and ethics, treatment effect, treatment scheme, and treatment process. Finally, we identified the most important topics and their trends over time.Results: Users primarily focused on diagnosis and treatment attitude, with medical skills and ethics being the second-most important topic among users. As time progressed, the attention paid by users to diagnosis and treatment attitude increased-especially during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, when attention to diagnosis and treatment attitude increased significantly. User attention to the topic of medical skills and ethics began to decline during the COVID-19 outbreak, while attention to treatment effect and scheme generally showed a downward trend from 2017 to 2022. User attention to the treatment process exhibited a declining tendency before the COVID-19 outbreak, but increased after. Regarding sentiment analysis, most users exhibited a high degree of satisfaction for online medical services. However, positive user sentiments showed a downward trend over time, especially after the COVID-19 outbreak.Discussion: This study has reference value for assisting user choice regarding medical treatment, decision-making by doctors, and online medical platform design.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of social media has created several opportunities for patients to evaluate the quality of healthcare services by posting online reviews. The rich text and photographic information in the online reviews results insights into how patients' experience with the doctor and their satisfaction with healthcare service delivery. Various studies have performed patients' opinion analysis using textual contents. This study presents a novel multimodal approach to analyze the patients' sentiment regarding the quality of healthcare service delivery (high vs. low). In comparison with existing studies, we consider not only the unique textual contents but photographic contents as well from theYelp.complatform, which is more challenging due to feature extraction. We evaluate the performance of the baseline, and deep learning algorithms across textual cues, visual cues, and the fusion of both text and visual cues. Experimental results indicated that the addition of novel features increases the models' accuracy to 15.0% across text and visual cues. Furthermore, fusing text and visual contents improve the classification accuracy by at least 12.64% instead of considering the contents alone. Preliminary comparative experiments result show that the deep learning model outperformed all other algorithms. In comparison with several other state-of-the-art methods in the biomedical domain, the proposed model could significantly enhance the performance of the classifier indicating the effectiveness and suitability of the methodology.",

    "abstract": "Advances in healthcare social media and information about the doctor-patient (D-P) communication regarding the prior patients' treatment experience, can positively influence the D-P relationship. In pace with prior patients' photo-sharing on healthcare social media websites from personal computers and smartphones regarding their treatment experience, the amount of multi-modal content has been growing exponentially. Therefore, there is an increasing need for coping with such information to mine useful knowledge about the D-P communication. Scraping 68,610 reviews, including 4618 photos from a popular physician-rating site,, this study proposes a novel, real-time, multi-modal classification framework, which uses textual and visual modalities as a source of information. Furthermore, this work suggests a social media image filtering mechanism that filters duplicate and irrelevant information from the data. Results show that the data filtering enhances the information reliability, whereas the addition of novel text and visual feature sets improves the classification accuracy up to 16.94%. In addition, fusing textual and visual features enhance the performance of the classifier by 18.24%, which produces better results than considering them separately. The findings also revealed that deep learning algorithms outperformed the classical machine learning algorithms across the entire novel features model, indicating the usefulness and suitability of the proposed methodology. Lastly, the findings from extensive experiments on the physicians' reviews dataset will guide the doctors to demonstrate the implication of the proposed system for improving the D-P relationship.",
