Health-focused conversational agents in person-centered care: a review of apps,"Parmar, Pritika; Ryu, Jina; Pandya, Shivani; Sedoc, Joao; Agarwal, Smisha; NATURE PORTFOLIO; Parmar, Pritika; Ryu, Jina; Pandya, Shivani; Agarwal, Smisha; Sedoc, Joao; Agarwal, Smisha; Agarwal, Smisha; Ryu, Jina; Parmar, Pritika; pandya, shivani",2022,NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE,10.1038/s41746-022-00560-6,WOS:000757409600001,USA,"Health-focused apps with chatbots (""healthbots"") have a critical role in addressing gaps in quality healthcare. There is limited evidence on how such healthbots are developed and applied in practice. Our review of healthbots aims to classify types of healthbots, contexts of use, and their natural language processing capabilities. Eligible apps were those that were health-related, had an embedded text-based conversational agent, available in English, and were available for free download through the Google Play or Apple iOS store. Apps were identified using 42Matters software, a mobile app search engine. Apps were assessed using an evaluation framework addressing chatbot characteristics and natural language processing features. The review suggests uptake across 33 low- and high-income countries. Most healthbots are patient-facing, available on a mobile interface and provide a range of functions including health education and counselling support, assessment of symptoms, and assistance with tasks such as scheduling. Most of the 78 apps reviewed focus on primary care and mental health, only 6 (7.59%) had a theoretical underpinning, and 10 (12.35%) complied with health information privacy regulations. Our assessment indicated that only a few apps use machine learning and natural language processing approaches, despite such marketing claims. Most apps allowed for a finite-state input, where the dialogue is led by the system and follows a predetermined algorithm. Healthbots are potentially transformative in centering care around the user; however, they are in a nascent state of development and require further research on development, automation and adoption for a population-level health impact.",0,0,RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; EXERCISE COACH; BEHAVIORS; CHATBOTS; THERAPY,Review
Developing and Testing Automatic Models of Patient Communicative Health Literacy Using Linguistic Features: Findings from the ECLIPPSE study,"Crossley, Scott A.; Balyan, Renu; Liu, Jennifer; Karter, Andrew J.; McNamara, Danielle; Schillinger, Dean; ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD; Crossley, Scott A.; Balyan, Renu; McNamara, Danielle; Liu, Jennifer; Karter, Andrew J.; Schillinger, Dean; Crossley, Scott A.; Gomez Vergara, Walter",2021,HEALTH COMMUNICATION,10.1080/10410236.2020.1731781,WOS:000518397700001,USA,"Patients with diabetes and limited health literacy (HL) may have suboptimal communication exchange with their health care providers and be at elevated risk of adverse health outcomes. These difficulties are generally attributed to patients' reduced ability to both communicate and understand health-related ideas as well as physicians' lack of skill in identifying those with limited HL. Understanding and identifying patients with barriers posed by lower HL to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes is an important research avenue. However, doing so using traditional methods has proven difficult and infeasible to scale. This study using corpus analyses, expert human ratings of HL, and natural language processing (NLP) approaches to estimate HL at the individual patient level. The goal of the study is to better understand HL from a linguistic perspective and to open new research areas to enhance population management and individualized care. Specifically, this study examines HL as a function of patients' demonstrated ability to communicate health-related information to their providers via secure messages. The study develops an NLP-based HL model and validates the model by predicting patient-related events such as medical outcomes and hospitalizations. Results indicate that the developed model predicts human ratings of HL with similar to 80% accuracy. Validation indicates that lower HL patients are more likely to be nonwhite and have lower educational attainment. In addition, patients with lower HL suffered more negative health outcomes and had higher healthcare service utilization.",1,0,SELF-MANAGEMENT SUPPORT; DIABETES PATIENTS; PHYSICIANS; VALIDATION; STRATEGIES; ADHERENCE; QUALITY; LEXICON; CORPUS; MAIL,Article

These methods can be critical in providing high-quality care to patients with chronic rheumatological diseases lacking an optimal treatment, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is the second most prevalent autoimmune disease. Herein, following reviewing the basic concepts of AI, we summarize the advances in its applications in RA clinical practice and research. We provide directions for future investigations in this field after reviewing the current knowledge gaps and technical and ethical challenges in applying AI. Automated models have been largely used to improve RA diagnosis since the early 2000s, and they have used a wide variety of techniques, e.g., support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural networks. AI algorithms can facilitate screening and identification of susceptible groups, diagnosis using omics, imaging, clinical, and sensor data, patient detection within electronic health record (EHR), i.e., phenotyping, treatment response assessment, monitoring disease course, determining prognosis, novel drug discovery, and enhancing basic science research. They can also aid in risk assessment for incidence of comorbidities, e.g., cardiovascular diseases, in patients with RA. However, the proposed models may vary significantly in their performance and reliability. Despite the promising results achieved by AI models in enhancing early diagnosis and management of patients with RA, they are not fully ready to be incorporated into clinical practice. Future investigations are required to ensure development of reliable and generalizable algorithms while they carefully look for any potential source of bias or misconduct. We showed that a growing body of evidence supports the potential role of AI in revolutionizing screening, diagnosis, and management of patients with RA. However, multiple obstacles hinder clinical applications of AI models. Incorporating the machine and/or deep learning algorithms into real-world settings would be a key step in the progress of AI in medicine.",0,0,Rheumatoid arthritis; Autoimmune diseases; Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Imaging; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Precision medicine; Treatment; ELECTRONIC MEDICAL-RECORDS; DISEASE-ACTIVITY; HEALTH-CARE; AUTOMATED ASSESSMENT; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; CLINICAL-RESPONSE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; BIG DATA; MACHINE,Review

Text mining refers to a range of techniques to extract data from narrative sources. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of an automated approach for extracting adverse event keywords from within electronic health records. Methods The study involved 4 medical centers in the Region of Lombardy. A starting set of keywords was trained in an iterative process to develop queries for 7 adverse events, including those used by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as patient safety indicators. We calculated positive predictive values of the 7 queries and performed an error analysis to detect reasons for false-positive cases of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and urinary tract infection. Results Overall, 397,233 records were collected (34,805 discharge summaries, 292,593 emergency department notes, and 69,835 operation reports). Positive predictive values were higher for postoperative wound dehiscence (83.83%) and urinary tract infection (73.07%), whereas they were lower for deep vein thrombosis (5.37%), pulmonary embolism (13.63%), and postoperative sepsis (12.28%). The most common reasons for false positives were reporting of past events (42.25%), negations (22.80%), and conditions suspected by physicians but not confirmed by a diagnostic test (11.25%). Conclusions The results of our study demonstrated the feasibility of using an automated approach to detect multiple adverse events in several data sources. More sophisticated techniques, such as natural language processing, should be tested to evaluate the feasibility of using text mining as a routine method for monitoring adverse events in hospitals.",0,0,adverse event; keywords; electronic health record; ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS; AUTOMATED IDENTIFICATION; SURVEILLANCE,Article

However, the data analysis and management in IoMT remain challenging owing to the existence of a massive number of devices linked to the server environment, generating a massive quantity of healthcare data. In such cases, cognitive computing can be employed that uses many intelligent technologies-machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP) and others-to comprehend data expansively. Furthermore, breast cancer (BC) has been found to be a major cause of mortality among ladies globally. Earlier detection and classification of BC using digital mammograms can decrease the mortality rate. This paper presents a novel deep learning-enabled multi-objective mayfly optimization algorithm (DLMOMFO) for BC diagnosis and classification in the IoMT environment. The goal of this paper is to integrate deep learning (DL) and cognitive computing-based techniques for e-healthcare applications as a part of IoMT technology to detect and classify BC. The proposed DL-MOMFO algorithm involved Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (AWMF)-based noise removal and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE)-based contrast improvement techniques to improve the quality of the digital mammograms. In addition, a U-Net architecture-based segmentation method was utilised to detect diseased regions in the mammograms. Moreover, a SqueezeNet-based feature extraction and a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) classifier were used in the presented technique. To enhance the diagnostic performance of the presented method, the MOMFO algorithm was used to effectively tune the parameters of the SqueezeNet and FSVM techniques. The DL-MOMFO revealed that the DL-MOMFO technique outperformed existing techniques.",0,0,Cognitive computing; breast cancer; digital mammograms; image processing; internet of medical things; smart healthcare; BREAST-CANCER,Article

Patient awareness and easy availability of data on the Internet allows patients to become informed decision makers when it comes even to disease management. Mass media emphasize the issue of medical errors, making patients demanding for quality in medical care. In some healthcare settings, patents face a problem of interpreting medical data and making decisions on treatment tactics without having a doctor, who could potentially support them. Delegating this task to a Patient Decision Aide system can add automatically generated recommendations to result reports without adding significant workload on the doctors, increase patients' motivation and support their decisions. We have implemented a patient decision aid system based on the productions rules, which: Collects data from available sources; Automatically analyses and interprets laboratory test results; Recommends running additional tests for a more precise diagnostic; Delivers automatically generated reports to doctors and patients in a natural language. To achieve semantic interoperability with other systems we have implemented a FHIR engine. The knowledge base has been organized as a graph structure. The application is structured as a set of lightly coupled services, which implement the logic of the decision support system. In total, we have modelled 365 nodes of test components, 5084 nodes of inference rules, 49932 connections and 3072 blocks of text for medical certificates. The findings of the research provide a deep understanding of how the semantically interoperable clinical decision support systems are implemented.

Methods: Topical and sentiment analysis was conducted using natural language processing (NLP) of Google and Yelp caregiver reviews (n = 3393) between 2013-2023 using Google NLP. Stratified sampling weighted by hospice size to approximate the daily census of US hospice enrollees. Results: Overall caregiver sentiment of hospice care was neutral (S = .14). Therapeutic, achievable expectations and misperceptions, unachievable expectations were, respectively, the most and least prevalent domains. Four topics with the highest prevalence, all had moderately positive sentiments: caring staff, staff professionalism and knowledge; emotional, spiritual, bereavement support; and responsive, timely or helpful. Lowest sentiments scores were lack of staffing; promises made, but not kept, pain, symptoms and medications; sped-up death, hasted, or sedated; and money, staff motivations. Significance of Results: Caregivers overall rating of hospice was neutral, largely due to moderate sentiment on achievable expectations in two-thirds of reviews mixed with unachievable expectations in one-sixth of reviews. Hospice caregivers were most likely to recommend hospices with caring staff, providing quality care, responsive to requests, and offering family support. Lack of staff, inadequate pain-symptom management were the two biggest barriers to hospice quality. All eight CAHPS measures were found in the discovered review topics.

Patient experience is a key aspect that should be gauged and monitored continuously. However, the measurement of such a vital indicator typically cannot be carried out directly, instead being derived from the opinions of patients who usually express their experience in free text. When it comes to patient comments written in the Arabic language, the currently used strategy to classify Arabic comments is totally reliant on human annotation, which is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity and error. Thus, fully using the value of patient feedback in a timely manner is difficult. This paper addresses the problem of classifying patient experience (PX) comments written in Arabic into 25 classes by using deep learning- and BERT-based models. A real-world data set of patient comments is obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Health for this purpose. Features are extracted from the data set, then used to train deep learning-based classifiers-including BiLSTM and BiGRU-for which pre-trained static word embedding and pre-training vector word embeddings are utilized. Furthermore, we utilize several Arabic pre-trained BERT models, in addition to building PX_BERT, a customized BERT model using the PX unlabeled database. From the experimental results for the 28 classifiers built in this study, the best-performing models (based on the F1 score) are found to be PX_BERT and AraBERTv02.

In this article, we propose a novel approach that is capable of automatically mining domain terminologies using search engine's query log-a type of domain-independent corpus of higher availability, coverage, and timeliness than a manually collected domain-specific corpus. In particular, we represent query log as a heterogeneous network and formulate the task of mining domain terminology as transductive learning on the heterogeneous network. In the proposed approach, the manifold structure of domain-specificity inherent in query log is captured by using a novel network embedding algorithm and further exploited to reduce the need for the manual annotation efforts for domain terminology classification.

This condition results in abnormal protein deposits building up, causing damage to multiple nerves (polyneuropathy) and other organs, which can shorten lifespan and have other harmful effects. Polyneuropathy symptoms include weakness, numbness, pain, dizziness, and diarrhea. Over time, everyday activities become more difficult as patients become increasingly disabled and dependent on others. Several treatments have been approved for the polyneuropathy of ATTRv amyloidosis. Many of these work in different ways to impact the disease process. An indirect treatment comparison is a well-established statistical method used by healthcare decision-makers to compare treatments when head-to-head trials are unavailable. Indirect treatment comparisons using a common approach, the Bucher method, yield similar conclusions to head-to-head studies over 90% of the time. This method was used to compare clinical trial data for tafamidis and vutrisiran, two approved treatments for ATTRv amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The findings show that vutrisiran is more effective than tafamidis at addressing the polyneuropathy of ATTRv amyloidosis as measured by changes to sensory or motor nervous system functioning and nutritional status. Also, vutrisiran showed greater maintenance of health-related quality of life compared to tafamidis. The expected benefits of vutrisiran over tafamidis are large enough to be noticeable and clinically meaningful to a patient or clinician. This highlights the potential advantages of vutrisiran compared to tafamidis with regard to preservation of physical function and quality of life when treating ATTRv amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.",0,0,familial amyloidosis; hereditary amyloidosis; indirect treatment comparison; patisiran; polyneuropathy; quality of life; tafamidis; vutrisiran; CARE DECISION-MAKING; NATURAL-HISTORY; TASK-FORCE; METAANALYSIS; PROGRESSION; SAFETY; SCORE,Article

Medical data classification using the data collected by the wearables and IoT devices can be used to determine the presence or absence of disease. The recently developed deep learning (DL) models can be used for several processes such as classification, natural language processing, etc. This study presents a bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) based convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) with class imbalance handling (CIH) model, named BFO-CNN-GRU-CIH for medical data classification in IoT enabled cloud environment. The proposed BFO-CNN-GRU-CIH model initially enables the IoT devices to gather healthcare data and preprocess it for further processing. In addition, Lempel Ziv Markov chain Algorithm (LZMA) is employed for the compression of healthcare data to reduce the amount of data being communicated. Besides, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to handle class imbalance data problems. Moreover, BFO with CNN-GRU model is utilized to perform the classification process in which the hyperparameters of the CNN-GRU model are optimally adjusted by the use of BFO algorithm. In order to showcase the better performance of the BFOCNN-GRU-CIH model, a wide range of simulations take place on three benchmark datasets and the results portrayed the betterment of the BFO-CNNGRU-CIH model over the recent state of art approaches.",0,0,IoT; cloud; healthcare; deep learning; parameter tuning; class imbalance handling; SYSTEM,Article

Neural-network based adaptive context prediction model for ambient intelligence,"Kim, Joo-Chang; Chung, Kyungyong; SPRINGER HEIDELBERG; Kim, Joo-Chang; Chung, Kyungyong; Chung, Kyungyong; Chung, Kyungyong; Joochang, Kim",2020,JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,10.1007/s12652-018-0972-3,WOS:000520835600011,South Korea,"To overcome the limitations of the conventional medical service in terms of ageing and chronic diseases, AmI-based precision medicine has drawn particular attention. Precision medicine is a customized personal medical service using various information technologies such as personal health device, AI algorithm, image recognition, voice recognition, and natural language processing. In particular, the information technologies for follow-up care services for patients, such as context awareness, context information, and inference rules, are required. In PHD, contexts such as variable data include blood pressure, BMI, blood sugar, weather, and food. It has time-series characteristics, meaning that it changes often with time. Other kinds of health-related information, such as age, family history, smoking, and residential area, are intermittently changed. For inference that is highly related to a user, the context collected through AmI is presented with ontology. Ontology consists of a user's ambient data, weather data, and lifelog. Context is changed along with a user's ambient conditions and time. An inference engine is used to create the knowledge base and predict a change. This study proposes a neural-network based adaptive context prediction model for ambient intelligence. This is a learning model using neural network to calculate the similarity for recommendation in a mining lifecare platform. In a conventional prediction procedure, an error is used to update a weight. The proposed model learns the similarity weight of the users to become adapted to the user's ambient. Based on the knowledge base, user clustering and deviation from mean are applied to calculate the similarity weight. Collaborative filtering technology is used to predict a user's context and learn the similarity weight repeatedly using a neural network. According to the performance evaluation, the proposed neural-network based similarity weight method had the highest accuracy of prediction when the learning rate was 0.001. Consequently, we found that AmI is a new added-value technology to maintain a healthy lifestyle and contributes to developing the healthcare industry and improving the quality of life.",2,0,Data mining; Neural network; Intelligence of Things; Context Computing; Ambient intelligence; SERVICE; SYSTEM,Article

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used in various domains, including banking, healthcare, manufacturing, energy management, security, trade or insurance. However, building reliable ML models is challenging. First, because in order to build prediction models by ML algorithms, massive amounts of pre-processed data are needed, but in practice, such datasets are scarce or require a tremendous amount of time to be prepared. Second, because once a model is built, its performance needs to be assessed. To this end, benchmarks are needed, but their availability is limited as well. Despite the fact that ML algorithms are used in multiple domains, their application to the legal domain so far has received little attention from research communities. This fact motivated us to run a project to build and make available an open repository called the European Court of Human Rights Open Data (ECHR-OD) of judgment documents. In this paper, we describe a step-by-step Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process, supported with code snippets, for building ECHR-OD, so that it can be easily reproduced. The process produces (almost) exhaustive datasets that have been transformed, homogenized, re-organized, cleaned beforehand, and made available in a suitable format for ML algorithms. The ECHR-OD repository makes available tabular descriptive features as well as features extracted from natural language documents, accessible via a web user interface. Moreover, we provide a self-contained and easily reproducible set of experiments assessing ML classification algorithms on the content of the ECHR-OD repository. To the best of our knowledge, the ETL process and the set of experiments form the first fully end-to-end, from ingesting and pre-processing legal documents to obtaining high quality ML models, open, and reproducible benchmark on the prediction of the European Court of Human Rights judgments. Both components, the ETL and the experiments, leverage Docker for reproducibility. The content of this paper weakly reproduces the original results and provides a new weakly reproducible set of experiments.",0,0,European court of human rights; Open repository of legal documents; Legal analytics; Classification algorithms on legal data; Experiments reproducibility,Article

Association rules among attributes are common knowledge patterns, which can often provide potential and useful information such as mobile users' interests. Actually, almost each attribute is associated with a hierarchy of the domain. Given an relation R = (U, A) and any cut alpha(a) on the hierarchy for every attribute a, there is another rough relation R-Phi , where Phi = (alpha(a): a subset of A). This paper will establish the connection between the functional dependencies in R and R-Phi(,) propose the method for extracting reducts in R-Phi, and demonstrate the implementation of proposed method on an application in data mining of association rules. The method for acquiring association rules consists of the following three steps: (1) translating natural texts into relations, by NLP; (2) translating relations into rough ones, by attributes analysis or fuzzy k-means (FKM) clustering; and (3) extracting association rules from concept lattices, by formal concept analysis (FCA).

However, access to adequate care remains a challenge, particularly for underserved communities with limited resources. Text mining tools offer immense potential to support mental healthcare by assisting professionals in diagnosing and treating patients. This study addresses the scarcity of Arabic mental health resources for developing such tools. We introduce MentalQA, a novel Arabic dataset featuring questioning-answering (QA) style, including a total of 1000 annotations. To ensure data quality, we conducted a rigorous annotation process using a well-defined schema with quality control measures. Data was collected from a question-answering medical platform. The annotation schema for mental health questions and corresponding answers draws upon existing classification schemes with some modifications. Question types encompass six distinct categories: diagnosis, treatment, anatomy & physiology, epidemiology, healthy lifestyle, and provider choice. Answer strategies include information provision, direct guidance, and emotional support. Three experienced annotators collaboratively annotated the data to ensure consistency. Our findings demonstrate high inter-annotator agreement, with Fleiss' Kappa of 0.61 for question types and 0.98 for answer strategies. Our in-depth analysis uncovered insightful patterns in patients behavior and doctor responses. We found a link between the types of questions asked and the strategies doctors use in their answers. Both genders focused on treatment-related questions, though with some variation in emphasis. Interestingly, the types of questions asked also differed by age group. Patients tended to express negative emotions in their questions, while doctors maintained a neutral tone in their responses. Finally, we observed differences in how long it took doctors to answer and the number of words they used depending on the type of question. MentalQA offers a valuable foundation for developing Arabic text mining tools capable of supporting mental health professionals and individuals seeking information.",2,0,Annotations; Mental health; Medical services; Task analysis; Medical diagnostic imaging; Depression; Collaboration; Corpus creation; mental health; natural language processing; question-answering; questions classification,Article

Previous studies have observed mental health problems, including substance use, as a prominent antecedent before death. The purpose of this study was to explore the characteristics of nurses who died by suicide documented in the death investigation narratives from the National Violent Death Reporting System from 2003 to 2017 using thematic analysis and natural language processing. One thousand three hundred and fifty-eight subjects met these inclusion criteria. Narratives from 601 subjects were thematically analyzed and 2544 individual narratives were analyzed using natural language processing. The analyses revealed five themes: ""mental health treatment,"" ""poor general health and chronic pain,"" ""substance use,"" ""worsening mental health after bereavement,"" and ""repeating a family member's suicide."" Mental health/substance use, chronic illness, and chronic pain were seen to coexist in a complex, interdependent manner that appeared to be entangled in the nurses' narratives before death. These findings echo the need for reducing the stigmatization of mental health problems in nursing and removing barriers to help-seeking behaviors as early preventative interventions. Future research is needed to determine if a comprehensive healthcare integration approach to address these entangled problems would reduce suicide vulnerability in nurses and improve their quality of life.",0,0,chronic pain; depression; mental health; natural language processing; nurse; occupational stress; substance-related disorders; suicide; SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; CARE; PROFESSIONALS; PREVALENCE; FACILITIES; SEEKING; RISK,Article

Understanding metachronous cancer risk is poor due to lack of accurate large-volume datasets. We outline the use of natural language processing (NLP) in forming the Partners Colonoscopy Cohort, an integrated longitudinal cohort of patients undergoing colonoscopies. Methods We identified endoscopy quality data from endoscopy reports for colonoscopies performed from 2007 to 2018 in a large integrated healthcare system, Mass General Brigham). Through modification of an established NLP pipeline, we extracted histopathological data (polyp location, histology and dysplasia) from corresponding pathology reports. Pathology and endoscopy data were merged by polyp location using a four-stage algorithm. NLP and merging procedures were validated by manual review of 500 pathology reports. Results 305,656 colonoscopies in 213,924 patients were identified. After merging, 76,137 patients had matched polyp data for 334,750 polyps. CAs and SPs were present in 86,707 (28.5%) and 55,373 (18.2%) colonoscopies. Among patients with polyps at index screening colonoscopy, 14,931 (33.4%) had follow-up colonoscopy (median 46.4, interquartile range 33.8-62.4 months); 91 (0.2%) and 1127 (2.5%) patients developed metachronous CRC and high-risk polyps (polyps >= 10 mm or CAs having high-grade dysplasia/villous/tublovillous histology or SPs with dysplasia). Genetic data were available for 23,787 (31.7%) patients with polyps from the Partners Biobank. The validation study showed a positive predictive value of 100% for polyp histology and locations.

Aim The aim of this study was to describe the landscape of technology-enhanced approaches that could be used to facilitate medical chart review within and across distributed data networks. Method We conducted a semi-structured survey regarding processes for medical chart review with organizations that either routinely do medical chart review or use technologies that could facilitate chart review. Results Fifteen out of 17 interviewed organizations used optical character recognition (OCR) or natural language processing (NLP) in their chart review process. None used handwriting recognition software. While these organizations found OCR and NLP to be useful for expediting extraction of useful information from medical charts, they also mentioned several challenges. Quality of medical scans can be variable, interfering with the accuracy of OCR. Additionally, linguistic complexity in medical notes and heterogeneity in reporting templates used by different healthcare systems can reduce the transportability of NLP-based algorithms to diverse healthcare settings. Conclusion New technologies including OCR and NLP are currently in use by various organizations involved in medical chart review. While technology-enhanced approaches could scale up capacity to validate key variables and make information about important clinical variables from medical records more generally available for research purposes, they often require considerable customization when employed in a distributed data environment with multiple, diverse healthcare settings.",0,0,HEALTH; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; VALIDITY; DATABASE; FOOD; TEXT,Review
Dilated convolution for enhanced extractive summarization: A GAN-based approach with BERT word embedding,"Wu, Huimin; IOS PRESS; Wu, Huimin; Wu, Huimin",2024,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS,10.3233/JIFS-234709,WOS:001193319500108,Peoples R China,"Text summarization (TS) plays a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP) by automatically condensing and capturing key information from text documents. Its significance extends to diverse fields, including engineering, healthcare, and others, where it offers substantial time and resource savings. However, manual summarization is a laborious task, prompting the need for automated text summarization systems. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for extractive summarization that leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) word embedding. BERT, a transformer-based architecture, processes sentence bidirectionally, considering both preceding and following words. This contextual understanding empowers BERT to generate word representations that carry a deeper meaning and accurately reflect their usage within specific contexts. Our method adopts a generator and discriminator within the GAN framework. The generator assesses the likelihood of each sentence in the summary while the discriminator evaluates the generated summary. To extract meaningful features in parallel, we introduce three dilated convolution layers in the generator and discriminator. Dilated convolution allows for capturing a larger context and incorporating long-range dependencies. By introducing gaps between filter weights, dilated convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to consider a broader context of words. To encourage the generator to explore diverse sentence combinations that lead to high-quality summaries, we introduce various noises to each document within our proposed GAN. This approach allows the generator to learn from a range of sentence permutations and select the most suitable ones. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The results, measured using the ROUGE metric, demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to other tested methods. This confirms the effectiveness of our GAN-based strategy, which integrates dilated convolution layers, BERT word embedding, and a generator-discriminator framework in achieving enhanced extractive summarization performance.",0,0,Automated extractive summarization; generative adversarial network; bidirectional encoder representations from; transformers; dilated convolution layer; NETWORKS,Article
