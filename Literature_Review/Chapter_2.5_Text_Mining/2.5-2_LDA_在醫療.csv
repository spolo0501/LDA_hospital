As one of the most important features that determine the degree of image's aesthetics quality, color harmony has gained increasing attentions. To overcome the problems of most classical color harmony models, which are heavily relied on heuristic rules and ignore the semantic information of images, we propose a statistical learning framework in this paper to train a color harmony model from a large number of natural images. In this framework, the semantic label information, which indicates the content of each image, along with the visual features is used to facilitate the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) training. Then, the degree of color harmony can be estimated by using supervised/unsupervised models, which is applied to indicate the photo's aesthetics score. By using the proposed color harmony model, we attempt to uncover the underlying principles that generate pleasing color combinations based on natural images. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional heuristic color harmony models for image aesthetics assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Precedents (statements from prior cases) play an important role in The Common Law system, where lawyers need to frequently refer to relevant prior cases. Measuring document similarity is one of the most crucial aspects of any document retrieval system which decides the speed, scalability and accuracy of the system. Text-based and network-based methods for computing similarity among case reports have already been proposed in prior works but not without a few pitfalls. Since legal citation networks are generally highly disconnected, network based metrics are not suited for them. Till date, only a few text-based and predominant embedding based methods have been employed, for instance, TF-IDF based approaches, Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013) and Doc2Vec (Le and Mikolov 2014) based approaches. We investigate the performance of 56 different methodologies for computing textual similarity across court case statements when applied on a dataset of Indian Supreme Court Cases. Among the 56 different methods, thirty are adaptations of existing methods and twenty-six are our proposed methods. The methods studied include models such as BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) and Law2Vec (Ilias 2019). It is observed that the more traditional methods (such as the TF-IDF and LDA) that rely on a bag-of-words representation performs better than the more advanced context-aware methods (like BERT and Law2Vec) for computing document-level similarity. Finally we nominate, via empirical validation, five of our best performing methods as appropriate for measuring similarity between case reports. Among these five, two are adaptations of existing methods and the other three are our proposed methods.",0,0,Legal information retrieval; Court case reports; Court case similarity; Topic modeling; Word2vec; Doc2vec; BERT; Law2vec,Article

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the long-term effects of the accumulation of GBCA in the body. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of using texture analysis in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and machine learning algorithms to discriminate active from inactive MS lesions without the use of GBCA.Methods: To achieve this purpose, we introduce an image processing pipeline. In the proposed pipeline, following registration and alignment of slices, MS lesions from DWI images are segmented and quantized. Next, different texture analysis methods are employed to extract texture features from the lesions. Then, a two-stage feature reduction method is applied, in which the first stage involves a statistical t-test and the second stage relies on principal component analysis (PCA), sequential forward selection (SFS), sequential backward selection (SBS), and ReliefF algorithms. Finally, we use five classifiers logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K nearest neighbor (KNN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in a 5-fold cross-validation procedure to determine active and inactive MS lesions.Results: In this study, we collected and prepared 255 active/inactive MS lesions from MRI scans of 34 patients diagnosed with MS, with a mean age of 35.56 +/- 10.89. Among 89 texture features extracted, 63 features showed statistically significant differences between the means of active and inactive lesions (P<0.05). The SVM classifier with the PCA feature reduction algorithm demonstrated the best performance with an average accuracy of 0.960 (+/- 0.024), specificity and precision of 1.0, sensitivity of 0.913 (+/- 0.053), and AUC of 0.957 (+/- 0.027).Conclusion: Our study indicates that DWI changes detected using texture analysis-based machine learning models can precisely differentiate active from inactive MS lesions. This finding provides valuable clinical information for the early diagnosis and effective monitoring of MS disease.",6,0,Multiple sclerosis; Active lesion; Texture analysis; Machine learning; MRI; BRAIN; GADOLINIUM,Article
Latent Dirichlet Allocation in predicting clinical trial terminations,"Geletta, Simon; Follett, Lendie; Laugerman, Marcia; BMC; Geletta, Simon; Follett, Lendie; Laugerman, Marcia; Geletta, Simon; Geletta, Simon; Geletta, Simon",2019,BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING,10.1186/s12911-019-0973-y,WOS:000499414600002,USA,"Background This study used natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify reliable patterns from within research narrative documents to distinguish studies that complete successfully, from the ones that terminate. Recent research findings have reported that at least 10 % of all studies that are funded by major research funding agencies terminate without yielding useful results. Since it is well-known that scientific studies that receive funding from major funding agencies are carefully planned, and rigorously vetted through the peer-review process, it was somewhat daunting to us that study-terminations are this prevalent. Moreover, our review of the literature about study terminations suggested that the reasons for study terminations are not well understood. We therefore aimed to address that knowledge gap, by seeking to identify the factors that contribute to study failures. Method We used data from the repository, from which we extracted both structured data (study characteristics), and unstructured data (the narrative description of the studies). We applied natural language processing techniques to the unstructured data to quantify the risk of termination by identifying distinctive topics that are more frequently associated with trials that are terminated and trials that are completed. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique to derive 25 ""topics"" with corresponding sets of probabilities, which we then used to predict study-termination by utilizing random forest modeling. We fit two distinct models - one using only structured data as predictors and another model with both structured data and the 25 text topics derived from the unstructured data. Results In this paper, we demonstrate the interpretive and predictive value of LDA as it relates to predicting clinical trial failure. The results also demonstrate that the combined modeling approach yields robust predictive probabilities in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, relative to a model that utilizes the structured data alone. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that the use of topic modeling using LDA significantly raises the utility of unstructured data in better predicating the completion vs. termination of studies. This study sets the direction for future research to evaluate the viability of the designs of health studies.",2,0,Clinical trials; Structured data; Unstructured data; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Prediction; FOR-DISEASE-CONTROL; PUBLICATION,Article

For breast mass classification into the benign or malignant category, an enhanced automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) model is suggested in this work, enabling radiologists to identify breast diseases correctly in less time. First, a fast discrete curvelet transform with wrapping (FDCT-WRP) is deployed to extract the curve-like features and create a feature set. Then, a combined feature reduction strategy called principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to produce more relevant and reduced feature sets. Finally, a new enhanced learning algorithm called MODPSO-ELM incorporates modified particle swarm optimization (MODPSO) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) proposed for the classification task. In the MODPSO-ELM algorithm, MODPSO is utilized to optimize the hidden node parameters (input weights and hidden biases) of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN) and analytically determined the output weight. The proposed CAD model has been evaluated on three standard datasets with a 10 xk-fold stratified cross-validation (SCV) test. It is found from the experiment that the suggested CAD model yields the best outcome for the MIAS dataset and obtains an accuracy of 98.94% and 98.76% for DDSM and INbreast datasets, respectively.

The research concludes that the research tool system of China's hog price control is formed. The overall design of the hog price control policy is relatively reasonable, but there are still the following problems: the subject of China's pig price control policy is singular, so it is difficult to form a resultant force; the policy pays attention to the price regulation in the short term, but ignores the long-term industrial structure adjustment; it emphasizes market supervision, but insufficient support for slaughtering and processing; it focuses on production and management to improve the development quality and efficiency of the pig industry, but does not take social equity into account. Finally, some policy suggestions are put forward: multi-department division of labor and close cooperation; adjusting the industrial structure of hog and carrying out appropriate large-scale breeding; establishing the operation mode of slaughtering and processing in the producing area to reduce the circulation cost of the pig industry; ensuring the consumption of pork by low-income groups and giving consideration to social efficiency and equity.",0,0,food price; pig price; food policy control; text mining; PMC index model,Article

Cyber Physical System (CPS) is particularly called as networked connected system, in which the system components are spatially distributed and integrated via the communication network. The control mechanism ensures computation significance; however, the system does affect attacks. Researchers are trying to handle this issue via the existing anomaly datasets. In this way, this paper follows an intrusion detection system under three major stages including extraction of features, selection of feature, and detection. The primary stage is the extraction of Statistical features like standard deviation, mean, mode, variance, and median, as well as higher-order statistical features like moment, percentile, improved correlation, kurtosis, mutual information, skewness, flow-based features, and information gain-based features. The curse of dimensionality becomes a significant problem in this scenario, so it is crucial to choose the right features. Improved Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is utilized to choose the right features. The selected features are subjected to a Hybrid classifier for final detection. Here, models like CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and Bi-GRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) are combined. A new Bernoulli Map Estimated Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (BMEAOA) is added to train the system by adjusting the ideal weights of the two classifiers, leading to improved detection outcomes.

However, the translational significance remains unclear. Human engineered heart tissues (EHTs) provide a means of quantifying the effects of chronic oc1A-AR stimulation on human cardiomyocyte physiology. EHTs were created from thin slices of decellularized pig myocardium seeded with human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. With a paired experi-mental design, EHTs were cultured for 3 wk, mechanically tested, cultured again for 2 wk with oc1A-AR agonist A61603 (10 nM) or vehi-cle control, and retested after drug washout for 24 h. Separate control experiments determined the effects of EHT age (3-5 wk) or repeat mechanical testing. We found that chronic A61603 treatment caused a 25% increase of length-dependent activation (LDA) of contraction compared with vehicle treatment (n = 7/group, P = 0.035). EHT force was not increased after chronic A61603 treatment. However, after vehicle treatment, EHT force was increased by 35% relative to baseline testing (n = 7/group, P = 0.022), suggesting EHT maturation. Control experiments suggested that increased EHT force resulted from repeat mechanical testing, not from EHT aging. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the oc1A-AR is expressed in human EHTs and found chronic A61603 treatment affected gene expression in biological pathways known to be activated by oc1A-ARs, including the MAP kinase signaling pathway. In conclusion, increased LDA in human EHT after chronic A61603 treatment raises the possibility that chronic stimulation of the oc1A-AR might be beneficial for increasing LDA in human myocardium and might be beneficial for treating human heart failure by restoring LDA.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Chronic stimulation of oc1A-adrenergic receptors (oc1A-ARs) is known to mediate therapeutic effects in animal heart failure models. To investigate the effects of chronic oc1A-AR stimulation in human cardiomyocytes, we tested engineered heart tissue (EHT) created with iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. RNA-seq analysis confirmed human EHT expressed oc1A- ARs. Chronic (2 wk) oc1A-AR stimulation with A61603 (10 nM) increased length-dependent activation (LDA) of contraction. Chronic oc1A-AR stimulation might be beneficial for treating human heart failure by restoring LDA.",0,0,Adult; Affect; Apoptosis; Biological Assay; Blood capillaries; Cardiac; Cardiac Output; Cause of Death; Computer Models; Data; Data Set; Disease; Exposure to; Failure; Fibrosis; Functional disorder; Generations; Goals; Hand; Heart; Human; Human Rights; Hypertrophy; Impairment; Individual; Kinetics; Left; Measurement; Measures; Mechanics; Microfilaments; Mitochondria; Modeling; Morbidity - disease rate; Muscle Cells; Myocardial tissue; Myocardium; Nature; Necrosis; Organ; Organelles; Organism; Oxidative Stress; Patients; Phenotype; Protocols documentation; Public Health; Pulmonary artery structure; Rattus; Relaxation; Respiration; Right ventricular structure; Rodent; Rodent Model; Sampling; Severities; Techniques; Testing; Time; Tissues; Ventricular; Whole Organism; Work; cardiovascular collapse; constriction; coronary fibrosis; crosslink; effective therapy; exercise capacity; exercise intolerance; experience; experimental study; human disease; improved; in vivo; mortality; multi-scale modeling; novel; predictive modeling; preservation; pressure; prevent; pulmonary arterial hypertension; pulmonary vascular remodeling; right ventricular failure; oc 1A-adrenergic receptor; engineered heart tissue; heart failure; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; RIGHT-VENTRICULAR FAILURE; CONTRACTILITY; HYPERTROPHY; MATURATION; REVERSAL; SUBTYPE; CELLS,Article
Porosity prediction: Supervised-learning of thermal history for direct laser deposition,"Khanzadeh, Mojtaba; Chowdhury, Sudipta; Marufuzzaman, Mohammad; Tschopp, Mark A.; Bian, Linkan; ELSEVIER SCI LTD; Khanzadeh, Mojtaba; Chowdhury, Sudipta; Marufuzzaman, Mohammad; Bian, Linkan; Tschopp, Mark A.; Bian, Linkan; Bian, Linkan; Bian, Linkan; Khanzadeh, Mojtaba; Tschopp, Mark",2018,JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS,10.1016/j.jmsy.2018.04.001,WOS:000435061400006,USA,"The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the melt pool characteristics and the defect occurrence in an as-built additive manufacturing part. One of the major detrimental microstructure properties associated with additive manufacturing (AM) is porosity within final parts. State-of-the-art porosity detection methods focus primarily on post-manufacturing approaches that are susceptible to high cost of process, longer process time, and are incapable of characterizing pores during fabrication. A real-time porosity prediction method is developed using morphological characteristics of the melt pool boundary (i.e., features obtained via functional principal component analysis (FPCA)). A thermal monitoring system is used to capture the time varying melt pool signal, which are labeled as either pores or normal melt pools by X-ray tomography. Supervised learning methods are utilized to identify the patterns of melt pool images and build a black-box model for the probability distribution of class labels (namely, porosity) based on data characteristics of predictors (e.g., melt pool characteristics). The resultant model does not depend on specific design of specimens with varying material properties; and can be effectively developed as long as thermal-porosity data can be obtained. In the current study, multiple supervised machine learning approaches are used to classify melt pools to predict porosity in a part. Two different accuracy measures are used and numerical experiments show that among the classification approaches used (i.e., Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)), KNN results in the highest rate of accurately classifying melt pools (98.44%). However, DT results in the lowest rate for incorrectly identifying normal melt pools as pores (0.03%). A comparative study is conducted that compares the performance of supervised learning methods leveraging the proposed morphological model and simple metrics of the melt pool. Numerical experiments show that the morphological model combined with supervised learning techniques vastly outperform the simple melt pool metrics combined with supervised learning techniques (approximately 250% better performance for correctly predicting abnormal melt pools). Our approach may potentially be applied to other AM processes that share similar energy-material interactions (e.g., powder bed fusion, electron beam melting).",8,0,Additive manufacturing; Supervised learning; Thermal history; Porosity prediction; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DECISION TREE CLASSIFICATION; RAY COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; NEURAL NETWORKS; FACE DETECTION; WATER-CONTENT; POOL; TEMPERATURE; TRANSFORM; MECHANISM,Article
Effects of cadmium contamination on bacterial and fungal communities in <i>Panax ginseng</i>-growing soil,"Sun, Hai; Shao, Cai; Jin, Qiao; Li, Meijia; Zhang, Zhenghai; Liang, Hao; Lei, Huixia; Qian, Jiaqi; Zhang, Yayu; BMC; Sun, Hai; Shao, Cai; Jin, Qiao; Li, Meijia; Zhang, Zhenghai; Liang, Hao; Lei, Huixia; Qian, Jiaqi; Zhang, Yayu; Sun, Hai; Shao, Cai; Jin, Qiao; Li, Meijia; Zhang, Zhenghai; Lei, Huixia; Qian, Jiaqi; Zhang, Yayu; Liang, Hao; Zhang, Yayu; Zhang, Yayu; Zhang, Yayu; Zhang, Yayu; qian, jiaqi",2022,BMC MICROBIOLOGY,10.1186/s12866-022-02488-z,WOS:000770757400001,Peoples R China,"Background Cadmium (Cd) contamination in soil poses a serious safety risk for the development of medicine and food with ginseng as the raw material. Microorganisms are key players in the functioning and service of soil ecosystems, but the effects of Cd-contaminated ginseng growth on these microorganisms is still poorly understood. To study this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of microorganisms and Cd (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg kg(-1) of Cd) exposure on the soil microbial community using Illumina HiSeq high-throughput sequencing. Results Our results indicated that Cd-contaminated soil affected the soil microbial diversity and composition, and bacterial diversity was affected more than fungal diversity in Cd-contaminated soil, especially according to Shannon indices. The abundance of the soil microbial community decreased and the composition changed according to the relative abundances at the phylum level, including those of Saccharibacteria and Gemmatimonadetes in bacteria and Mortierellomycota in fungi. The LEfSe algorithm was used to identify active biomarkers, and 45 differentially abundant bacterial taxonomic clades and 16 differentially abundant fungal taxonomic clades were identified with LDA scores higher than 4.0. Finally, a heatmap of Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) indicated that some key biomarkers, Arenimonas, Xanthomonadales, Nitrosomonadaceae, Methylophilales, Caulobacterales, Aeromicrobium, Chitinophagaceae, Acidimicrobiales, Nocardioidaceae, Propionibacteriales, Frankiales, and Gemmatimonadaceae, were positively correlated with the total and available Cd (p<0.05) but negatively correlated with AK, AP, and pH (p<0.05) in the bacterial community. Similarly, in the fungal community, Tubaria, Mortierellaceae, and Rhizophagus were positively correlated with the total and available Cd but negatively correlated with AK, AP, TK, and pH. Conclusion Cd contamination significantly affected microbial diversity and composition in ginseng-growing soil. Our findings provide new insight into the effects of Cd contamination on the microbial communities in ginseng-growing soil.",0,0,Panax ginseng; Cadmium contamination; Microbial community; HiSeq sequencing; HEAVY-METAL POLLUTION; LONG-TERM; MICROBIAL ACTIVITY; GROUPS DIFFER; BIOAVAILABILITY; PLANTS; CHINA,Article
