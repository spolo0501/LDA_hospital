Text Classification of Patient Experience Comments in Saudi Dialect Using Deep Learning Techniques,"Alhazzani, Najla Z.; Al-Turaiki, Isra M.; Alkhodair, Sarah A.; MDPI; Alhazzani, Najla Z.; Alkhodair, Sarah A.; Al-Turaiki, Isra M.; Al-Turaiki, Isra M.; Al-Turaiki, Isra; Alkhodair, Sarah; Alkhodair, Sarah A.; Al-Turaiki, Isra",2023,APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,10.3390/app131810305,WOS:001145086300001,Saudi Arabia,"Improving the quality of healthcare services is of the utmost importance in healthcare systems. Patient experience is a key aspect that should be gauged and monitored continuously. However, the measurement of such a vital indicator typically cannot be carried out directly, instead being derived from the opinions of patients who usually express their experience in free text. When it comes to patient comments written in the Arabic language, the currently used strategy to classify Arabic comments is totally reliant on human annotation, which is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity and error. Thus, fully using the value of patient feedback in a timely manner is difficult. This paper addresses the problem of classifying patient experience (PX) comments written in Arabic into 25 classes by using deep learning- and BERT-based models. A real-world data set of patient comments is obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Health for this purpose. Features are extracted from the data set, then used to train deep learning-based classifiers-including BiLSTM and BiGRU-for which pre-trained static word embedding and pre-training vector word embeddings are utilized. Furthermore, we utilize several Arabic pre-trained BERT models, in addition to building PX_BERT, a customized BERT model using the PX unlabeled database. From the experimental results for the 28 classifiers built in this study, the best-performing models (based on the F1 score) are found to be PX_BERT and AraBERTv02. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to tackle PX comment classification for the Arabic language.",0,0,text classification; multi-label classification; deep learning; natural language processing; NLP; word embeddings; Arabic; patient experience; PX; LSTM; GRU; BERT,Article

Experiences are mainly collected using closed-ended questions, although the value of open-ended questions is widely recognized. Natural language processing (NLP) can automate the analysis of open-ended questions for an efficient approach to patient-centeredness. Methods We developed the Artificial Intelligence Patient-Reported Experience Measures (AI-PREM) tool, consisting of a new, open-ended questionnaire, an NLP pipeline to analyze the answers using sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and a visualization to guide physicians through the results. The questionnaire and NLP pipeline were iteratively developed and validated in a clinical context. Results The final AI-PREM consisted of five open-ended questions about the provided information, personal approach, collaboration between healthcare professionals, organization of care, and other experiences. The AI-PREM was sent to 867 vestibular schwannoma patients, 534 of which responded. The sentiment analysis model attained an F1 score of 0.97 for positive texts and 0.63 for negative texts. There was a 90% overlap between automatically and manually extracted topics. The visualization was hierarchically structured into three stages: the sentiment per question, the topics per sentiment and question, and the original patient responses per topic. Conclusions The AI-PREM tool is a comprehensive method that combines a validated, open-ended questionnaire with a well-performing NLP pipeline and visualization. Thematically organizing and quantifying patient feedback reduces the time invested by healthcare professionals to evaluate and prioritize patient experiences without being confined to the limited answer options of closed-ended questions.",0,0,Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Unsupervised machine learning; Patient satisfaction; Patient-centered care,Article
Ten Considerations for Integrating Patient-Reported Outcomes into Clinical Care for Childhood Cancer Survivors,"Horan, Madeline R.; Sim, Jin-ah; Krull, Kevin R.; Ness, Kirsten K.; Yasui, Yutaka; Robison, Leslie L.; Hudson, Melissa M.; Baker, Justin N.; Huang, I-Chan; MDPI; Horan, Madeline R.; Sim, Jin-ah; Krull, Kevin R.; Ness, Kirsten K.; Yasui, Yutaka; Robison, Leslie L.; Hudson, Melissa M.; Huang, I-Chan; Sim, Jin-ah; Krull, Kevin R.; Hudson, Melissa M.; Baker, Justin N.; Huang, I-Chan; Robison, Leslie; Ness, Kirsten; Sim, Jin-ah; Baker, Justin; Horan, Madeline; Krull, Kevin; Hudson, Melissa; Huang, I-Chan; Yasui, Yutaka",2023,CANCERS,10.3390/cancers15041024,WOS:000938441300001,USA; South Korea,"Simple Summary Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are a useful way to assess the subjective experiences of health-related quality of life, functional status, symptoms, and other outcomes in childhood cancer survivors. In survivorship care, PROMs can be used to monitor health status and inform medical decision making. This article provides 10 important considerations for clinicians when they are assessing patient-reported outcomes for childhood cancer survivors. From choosing the right measure to selecting a strategy for clinical response, the purpose of these considerations is to support clinicians in implementing PROMs in their practice while keeping in mind some of the practical barriers and solutions of using PROMs with childhood cancer survivors. We end with an example of a framework for integrating PROMs into the clinical workflow that uses cutting-edge technologies (e.g., mHealth, natural language processing, and machine learning) to minimize interruptions to the clinical workflow and maximize the powerful utility of PROMs in cancer survivorship care. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are subjective assessments of health status or health-related quality of life. In childhood cancer survivors, PROMs can be used to evaluate the adverse effects of cancer treatment and guide cancer survivorship care. However, there are barriers to integrating PROMs into clinical practice, such as constraints in clinical validity, meaningful interpretation, and technology-enabled administration of the measures. This article discusses these barriers and proposes 10 important considerations for appropriate PROM integration into clinical care for choosing the right measure (considering the purpose of using a PROM, health profile vs. health preference approaches, measurement properties), ensuring survivors complete the PROMs (data collection method, data collection frequency, survivor capacity, self- vs. proxy reports), interpreting the results (scoring methods, clinical meaning and interpretability), and selecting a strategy for clinical response (integration into the clinical workflow). An example framework for integrating novel patient-reported outcome (PRO) data collection into the clinical workflow for childhood cancer survivorship care is also discussed. As we continuously improve the clinical validity of PROMs and address implementation barriers, routine PRO assessment and monitoring in pediatric cancer survivorship offer opportunities to facilitate clinical decision making and improve the quality of survivorship care.",0,0,childhood cancer survivors; patient-reported outcomes; health-related quality of life; implementation; symptoms; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; ADULT SURVIVORS; SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; PEDIATRIC CANCER; RESPONSE SHIFT; HEALTH-STATUS; PARENT-PROXY; ITEM BANKING; SELF-REPORT; CHILDREN,Review
Multilingual Framework for Risk Assessment and Symptom Tracking (MRAST),"Safran, Valentino; Lin, Simon; Nateqi, Jama; Martin, Alistair G.; Smrke, Urska; Arioz, Umut; Plohl, Nejc; Rojc, Matej; Bema, Dina; Chavez, Marcela; Horvat, Matej; Mlakar, Izidor; MDPI; Safran, Valentino; Smrke, Urska; Arioz, Umut; Rojc, Matej; Mlakar, Izidor; Lin, Simon; Nateqi, Jama; Martin, Alistair G.; Lin, Simon; Nateqi, Jama; Plohl, Nejc; Bema, Dina; Chavez, Marcela; Horvat, Matej; Mlakar, Izidor; Mlakar, Izidor; Bema, Dina; Mlakar, Izidor; ARIOZ, UMUT; Plohl, Nejc; Lin, Simon; Rojc, Matej; Arioz, Umut; Smrke, Urska; Safran, Valentino; Lin, Simon",2024,SENSORS,10.3390/s24041101,WOS:001172263400001,Slovenia; Austria; Latvia; Belgium,"The importance and value of real-world data in healthcare cannot be overstated because it offers a valuable source of insights into patient experiences. Traditional patient-reported experience and outcomes measures (PREMs/PROMs) often fall short in addressing the complexities of these experiences due to subjectivity and their inability to precisely target the questions asked. In contrast, diary recordings offer a promising solution. They can provide a comprehensive picture of psychological well-being, encompassing both psychological and physiological symptoms. This study explores how using advanced digital technologies, i.e., automatic speech recognition and natural language processing, can efficiently capture patient insights in oncology settings. We introduce the MRAST framework, a simplified way to collect, structure, and understand patient data using questionnaires and diary recordings. The framework was validated in a prospective study with 81 colorectal and 85 breast cancer survivors, of whom 37 were male and 129 were female. Overall, the patients evaluated the solution as well made; they found it easy to use and integrate into their daily routine. The majority (75.3%) of the cancer survivors participating in the study were willing to engage in health monitoring activities using digital wearable devices daily for an extended period. Throughout the study, there was a noticeable increase in the number of participants who perceived the system as having excellent usability. Despite some negative feedback, 44.44% of patients still rated the app's usability as above satisfactory (i.e., 7.9 on 1-10 scale) and the experience with diary recording as above satisfactory (i.e., 7.0 on 1-10 scale). Overall, these findings also underscore the significance of user testing and continuous improvement in enhancing the usability and user acceptance of solutions like the MRAST framework. Overall, the automated extraction of information from diaries represents a pivotal step toward a more patient-centered approach, where healthcare decisions are based on real-world experiences and tailored to individual needs. The potential usefulness of such data is enormous, as it enables better measurement of everyday experiences and opens new avenues for patient-centered care.",0,0,multilingual framework; risk assessment; symptom tracking; chronic diseases; patient-centered care; real-world data; PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES; SELF-REPORT; HEALTH-CARE; ELECTRONIC DIARIES; CLINICAL-TRIALS; CENTERED CARE; QUESTIONNAIRES; INACCURACY; QUALITY,Article
Natural language processing systems for capturing and standardizing unstructured clinical information: A systematic review,"Kreimeyer, Kory; Foster, Matthew; Pandey, Abhishek; Arya, Nina; Halford, Gwendolyn; Jones, Sandra F.; Forshee, Richard; Walderhaug, Mark; Botsis, Taxiarchis; ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE; Kreimeyer, Kory; Foster, Matthew; Pandey, Abhishek; Arya, Nina; Forshee, Richard; Walderhaug, Mark; Botsis, Taxiarchis; Halford, Gwendolyn; Jones, Sandra F.; Kreimeyer, Kory; Foster, Matthew; Walderhaug, Mark; Halford, Gwendolyn; Pandey, Abhishek",2017,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS,10.1016/j.jbi.2017.07.012,WOS:000426221700002,USA,"We followed a systematic approach based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses to identify existing clinical natural language processing (NLP) systems that generate structured information from unstructured free text. Seven literature databases were searched with a query combining the concepts of natural language processing and structured data capture. Two reviewers screened all records for relevance during two screening phases, and information about clinical NLP systems was collected from the final set of papers. A total of 7149 records (after removing duplicates) were retrieved and screened, and 86 were determined to fit the review criteria. These papers contained information about 71 different clinical NLP systems, which were then analyzed. The NLP systems address a wide variety of important clinical and research tasks. Certain tasks are well addressed by the existing systems, while others remain as open challenges that only a small number of systems attempt, such as extraction of temporal information or normalization of concepts to standard terminologies. This review has identified many NLP systems capable of processing clinical free text and generating structured output, and the information collected and evaluated here will be important for prioritizing development of new approaches for clinical NLP.

Yet, there is paucity of evidence to support serious illness communication behaviors among clinicians. Herein, we propose three methodological innovations to advance the basic science of serious illness communication.Results: First, advanced computation techniques - e.g. machine-learning techniques and natural language processing - offer the possibility to measure the characteristics and complex patterns of audible serious illness communication in large datasets. Second, immersive technologies - e.g., virtual- and augmented reality - allow for experimentally manipulating and testing the effects of specific communication strategies, and interactional and environmental aspects of serious illness communication. Third, digital-health technologies - e.g., shared notes and videoconferences - can be used to unobtrusively observe and manipulate communication, and compare in-person to digitally-mediated communication elements and effects. Immersive and digital health technologies allow integration of physiological measurement (e.g. synchrony or gaze) that may advance our understanding of patient experience.
