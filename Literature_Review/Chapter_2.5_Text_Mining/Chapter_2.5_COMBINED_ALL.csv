The signaling pathways have played a vital role in increasing or decreasing the possibility of the deadliest disease, cancer. To combine the pathways concept and ambiguity in the prediction techniques of such diseases, we have used the proposed research on fuzzy graphoidal covers of fuzzy graphs in this paper. Determining a path with uncertainty and shortest length is a challenging topic of graph theory, and a collection of such shortest paths maintaining specific conditions is defined as a fuzzy graphoidal cover for a fuzzy graph. Also, we have defined fuzzy graphoidal covering number as a new parameter, reflecting the measure of coverage by fuzzy graphoidal covering set in a system. Afterwards, some important characterizations of the fuzzy graphoidal covering number are established with justified proof. Also, specific limit values of this number are provided for particular cases. Then, we developed an efficient algorithm for finding the defined covering set with its space and time complexity. The findings of this proposed study have been composed with an artificial neural network to model a strong tool for resolving an essential issue of medical sciences, the prediction of cancer type in the human body. We have analyzed two types of neural networks such as one one-dimensional and two-dimensional specification, for clarity of the obtained results. Also, we have found out the most possible cancer type is breast cancer from the data of our considered case study as a concluding statement for any decision-maker in the field of health sciences. Finally, sensitivity analysis and comparative study have been done to show the stability of our proposed work.",0,0,Fuzzy graph; Covering problem; Fuzzy graphoidal covering number; Fuzzy shortest path; Cancer type prediction; BREAST-CANCER; GRAPHS,Article,1

This gap, referred to as the ""valley of death"" is due to the large number of ventures that failed to attract or retain investor funding, promotion, and clinical acceptance of their products. This loss can be attributed to a focus on a bench to bedside flow of ideas and technology, which does not account for the multitude of adoption, commercial, and regulatory constraints. The implementation of an alternative bedside to bench and back again approach permits investigators to focus on a specific unmet clinical need, defining crucial translation related questions early in the research process. Investigators often fail to accurately identify critical clinical adoption criteria due to their focus on improved patient outcomes. Other adoption criteria (such as price, time, ethical concerns, and place in the workflow) can cause a product to fail despite improved patient outcomes. By applying simplified business principles such as the build-measure-learn loop and the business model canvas to early-stage research projects, investigators can narrow in on appropriate research topics and define design constraints. Additionally, 86% of all clinical trials fail to result in Federal Drug Administration approval, resulting in significant economic burdens. On the reverse side, approval through the European Medical Agency is widely considered to be more direct but has its challenges. The Committee for Advanced Therapies within the European Medical Agency has received 22 market authorization applications for advanced therapy medicinal products, of which only 10 received authorization. A thorough understanding of the various regulatory pathways permits investigators to plan for future regulatory obstacles and potentially increase their chances of success. By utilizing a bedside to bench and back again approach, investigators can improve the odds that their research will have a meaningful clinical impact.",0,0,regenerative medicine; tissue engineering; regulation; food and drug administration; translation; commercialization; TRANSLATION; COMMERCIALIZATION; PATH,Review,0
Leveraging Organizational Health Literacy to Enhance Health Promotion and Risk Prevention: A Narrative and Interpretive Literature Review,"Palumbo, Rocco; YALE J BIOLOGY MEDICINE, INC; Palumbo, Rocco; Palumbo, Rocco; Palumbo, Rocco",2021,YALE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE,,WOS:000669538200012,Italy,"Organizational health literacy involves the health care organizations' ability to establish an empowering and co-creating relationship with patients, engaging them in the design and delivery of health services in collaboration with health professionals. Although scholars agree that organizational health literacy contributes to health promotion and risk prevention via patient empowerment, literature is not consistent in depicting the interplay between organizational health literacy and preventive medicine. The article intends to shed light into this issue, summarizing current knowledge about this topic and advancing avenues for further development. A narrative literature review was performed through a systematic search on PubMed (R), Scopus (R), and Web of Science (TM). The review focused on 50 relevant contributions. Organizational health literacy triggers the transition towards a patient-centered approach to care. It complements individual health literacy, enabling patients to actively participate in health promotion and risk prevention as co-producers of health services and co-creators of value. However, many obstacles - including lack of time and limited resources available - prevent the transition towards health literate health care organizations. Two initiatives are required to overcome extant barriers. On the one hand, a health literate workforce should be prepared to increase the institutional ability of health care organizations to empower and engage patients in health co-creation. On the other hand, increased efforts should be made to assess organizational health literacy and to make its contribution to preventive medicine explicit.",0,0,Health literacy; Organizational health literacy; Patient empowerment; Patient engagement; Preventive medicine; CARE ORGANIZATIONS; ENGAGEMENT; SYSTEMS; MODEL,Review,0
Anthropomorphic motion planning for multi-degree-of-freedom arms,"Zheng, Xiongfei; Han, Yunyun; Liang, Jiejunyi; FRONTIERS MEDIA SA; Zheng, Xiongfei; Liang, Jiejunyi; Han, Yunyun; Liang, Jiejunyi; Han, Yunyun; Han, Yunyun",2024,FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,10.3389/fbioe.2024.1388609,WOS:001242882200001,Peoples R China,"With the development of technology, the humanoid robot is no longer a concept, but a practical partner with the potential to assist people in industry, healthcare and other daily scenarios. The basis for the success of humanoid robots is not only their appearance, but more importantly their anthropomorphic behaviors, which is crucial for the human-robot interaction. Conventionally, robots are designed to follow meticulously calculated and planned trajectories, which typically rely on predefined algorithms and models, resulting in the inadaptability to unknown environments. Especially when faced with the increasing demand for personalized and customized services, predefined motion planning cannot be adapted in time to adapt to personal behavior. To solve this problem, anthropomorphic motion planning has become the focus of recent research with advances in biomechanics, neurophysiology, and exercise physiology which deepened the understanding of the body for generating and controlling movement. However, there is still no consensus on the criteria by which anthropomorphic motion is accurately generated and how to generate anthropomorphic motion. Although there are articles that provide an overview of anthropomorphic motion planning such as sampling-based, optimization-based, mimicry-based, and other methods, these methods differ only in the nature of the planning algorithms and have not yet been systematically discussed in terms of the basis for extracting upper limb motion characteristics. To better address the problem of anthropomorphic motion planning, the key milestones and most recent literature have been collated and summarized, and three crucial topics are proposed to achieve anthropomorphic motion, which are motion redundancy, motion variation, and motion coordination. The three characteristics are interrelated and interdependent, posing the challenge for anthropomorphic motion planning system. To provide some insights for the research on anthropomorphic motion planning, and improve the anthropomorphic motion ability, this article proposes a new taxonomy based on physiology, and a more complete system of anthropomorphic motion planning by providing a detailed overview of the existing methods and their contributions.",0,0,anthropomorphic; motion planning; arms; motion redundancy; motion variation; motion coordination; HUMAN-LIKE BEHAVIOR; MOTOR CONTROL; REACHING MOVEMENTS; EXOSKELETON ROBOT; MUSCLE SYNERGIES; HUMANOID ROBOT; HUMAN LIKENESS; PRIMITIVES; CONFIGURATION; COORDINATION,Review,0

It has been argued whether publications during the COVID-19 pandemic have met reporting standards. In this study, we assessed reporting adherence of RCTs on treatment interventions in COVID-19 patients to the CONSORT checklist and discuss which lessons can be learned to improve reporting in the future.Methods This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study performed at the University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Germany. We conducted a pragmatic systematic literature search in the PubMed database to identify RCTs on treatment interventions in COVID-19 patients in the first year of publications on the topic (March 2020-February 2021). We investigated the adherence of each publication to the CONSORT checklist and assessed the association between specific predictors and percentage adherence in an exploratory multivariable regression model.Results We analyzed 127 RCTs and found that the median percentage adherence to the CONSORT checklist was 54.3% [IQR 38.9 to 65.7].

However, almost all previous HPR methods have not adhered to the clinical principles of syndrome differentiation and treatment planning of TCM, which has resulted in suboptimal performance and difficulties in application to real-world clinical scenarios.Materials and Methods We emphasize the synergy among diagnosis and treatment procedure in real-world TCM clinical settings to propose the PresRecST model, which effectively combines the key components of symptom collection, syndrome differentiation, treatment method determination, and herb recommendation. This model integrates a self-curated TCM knowledge graph to learn the high-quality representations of TCM biomedical entities and performs 3 stages of clinical predictions to meet the principle of systematic sequential procedure of TCM decision making.Results To address the limitations of previous datasets, we constructed the TCM-Lung dataset, which is suitable for the simultaneous training of the syndrome differentiation, treatment method determination, and herb recommendation. Overall experimental results on 2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed PresRecST outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm by significant improvements (eg, improvements of P@5 by 4.70%, P@10 by 5.37%, P@20 by 3.08% compared with the best baseline).Discussion The workflow of PresRecST effectively integrates the embedding vectors of the knowledge graph for progressive recommendation tasks, and it closely aligns with the actual diagnostic and treatment procedures followed by TCM doctors. A series of ablation experiments and case study show the availability and interpretability of PresRecST, indicating the proposed PresRecST can be beneficial for assisting the diagnosis and treatment in real-world TCM clinical settings.Conclusion Our technology can be applied in a progressive recommendation scenario, providing recommendations for related items in a progressive manner, which can assist in providing more reliable diagnoses and herbal therapies for TCM clinical task.",0,0,progressive herbal recommendation; deep neural network; syndrome differentiation; treatment method determination; real-world clinical decision support; TOPIC MODEL; NETWORK,Article,2

This may affect their quality of life, but research on this topic is limited. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the relationship between habitual physical activity and quality of life in HD patients and healthy controls. Ninety-three HD patients and 140 controls participated in the study. Quality of life was assessed using a 36-item medical outcomes study short-form health survey (SF-36). Human Activity Profile (HAP) was used to assess habitual physical activity. The adjusted activity score (AAS) from HAP, age, gender, fat tissue index (FTI), lean tissue index (LTI), and Davies comorbidity score were analyzed as possible predictors of the Physical Component Summary (PCS) of the SF-36. Three sequential linear models were used to model PCS. In Model 1, PCS was regressed by gender and age; in Model 2 the LTI, FTI, and Davies comorbidity scores were added. Model 3 also included AAS. After controlling for age and gender (Model(HD) 1: p = 0.056), LTI, FTI, and Davies comorbidity score effects (Model(HD) 2: p = 0.181), the AAS accounted for 32% of the variation in PCS of HD patients (Model(HD) 3: p < 0.001). Consequently, the PCS of HD patients would increase by 0.431 points if the AAS increased by one point. However, in healthy controls, AAS had a lower impact than in the HD sample (B = 0.359 vs. 0.431), while the corresponding effects of age and gender (Model(H) 1: p < 0.001), LTI, FTI, and Davies comorbidity score (Model(H) 2: p < 0.001) were adjusted for. The proportion of variation in PCS attributed to AAS was 14.9% (Model(H) 3: p < 0.001). The current study results showed that physical activity in everyday life as measured by the HAP questionnaire is associated to a higher degree with the quality of life of HD patients than in healthy subjects. Routine physical activity programs are therefore highly justified, and the nephrology community should play a leading role in this effort.",0,0,quality of life; hemodialysis patients; physical functioning; impact; human activity profile; CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; MORTALITY; EXERCISE; TIME,Article,0

However, small sample sizes and nonsignificant findings have hindered precise effect estimates. In this analysis we evaluate the association of calcium administration with survival in a large retrospective cohort of patients with cardiac arrest treated in the emergency department (ED). Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records from two academic hospitals (one quaternary care center, one county trauma center) in San Francisco between 2011 and 2019. Inclusion criteria were patients aged greater than or equal to 18 years old who received treatment for cardiac arrest during their ED course. Our primary exposure was the administration of calcium while in the ED and the main outcome was survival to hospital admission. The association between calcium and survival to admission was estimated using a multivariable log-binomial regression, and also with two propensity score models. Results: We examined 781 patients with cardiac arrest treated in San Francisco EDs between 2011 and 2019 and found that calcium administration was associated with decreased survival to hospital admission (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.66-0.82). These findings remained significant after adjustment for patient age, sex, whether the cardiac arrest was witnessed, and including an interaction term for shockable cardiac rhythms (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.50- 0.72) and non-shockable cardiac rhythms (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.76-0.99). Risk ratios for the association between calcium and survival to hospital admission were also similar between two propensity score-based models: nearest neighbor propensity matching model (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.68- 0.89) and inverse propensity weighted regression adjustment model (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.67-0.84). Conclusions: Calcium administration as part of ED-directed treatment for cardiac arrest was associated with lower survival to hospital admission. Given the lack of statistically significant outcomes from smaller, more methodologically robust evaluations on this topic, we believe these findings have an important role to serve in confirming previous results and allowing for more precise effect estimates. Our data adds to the growing body evidence against the empiric use of calcium in cardiac arrest.",1,0,Address; Anesthesia procedures; Area; Basic Science; Belief; Cardiopulmonary; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cardiovascular system; Career Mobility; Clinical; Clinical Research; Clinical Sciences; Communication; Credentialing; Diagnosis; Discipline; Disease; Doctor of Philosophy; Educational Status; Ensure; Faculty; Foundations; Funding; Future; Goals; Heart Diseases; Influentials; Institutes; Internal Medicine; Investigation; Leadership; Lung; Lung diseases; Mentors; Mentorship; Methodology; Molecular Medicine; Outcome; Pathway interactions; Patient Care; Pediatrics; Population Sciences; Prevention; Research; Research Methodology; Research Personnel; Research Project Grants; Research Support; Research Training; Residencies; Science; Scientific Advances and Accomplishments; Scientist; Time; Training; Training Programs; Translating; Translational Research; Work; career; career development; clinical investigation; clinically relevant; design; dissemination research; education resources; epidemiology study; experience; faculty mentor; faculty research; human subject; human tissue; implementation research; interest; multidisciplinary; population based; programs; recruit; skills; synergism; tool; translational scientist; Cardiac arrest; Calcium; Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; Pharmacotherapy; Emergency medicine; RESUSCITATION; ASSOCIATION; CHLORIDE,Article,0

In scientific research, AI can enhance the quality and efficiency of data analysis and publication. However, AI has also opened up the possibility of generating high-quality fraudulent papers that are difficult to detect, raising important questions about the integrity of scientific research and the trustworthiness of published papers.Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the capabilities of current AI language models in generating high-quality fraudulent medical articles. We hypothesized that modern AI models can create highly convincing fraudulent papers that can easily deceive readers and even experienced researchers. Methods: This proof-of-concept study used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) powered by the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model to generate a fraudulent scientific article related to neurosurgery. GPT-3 is a large language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text in response to prompts given by users. The model was trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet and is capable of generating high-quality text in a variety of languages and on various topics. The authors posed questions and prompts to the model and refined them iteratively as the model generated the responses. The goal was to create a completely fabricated article including the abstract, introduction, material and methods, discussion, references, charts, etc. Once the article was generated, it was reviewed for accuracy and coherence by experts in the fields of neurosurgery, psychiatry, and statistics and compared to existing similar articles.Results: The study found that the AI language model can create a highly convincing fraudulent article that resembled a genuine scientific paper in terms of word usage, sentence structure, and overall composition. The AI-generated article included standard sections such as introduction, material and methods, results, and discussion, as well a data sheet. It consisted of 1992 words and 17 citations, and the whole process of article creation took approximately 1 hour without any special training of the human user. However, there were some concerns and specific mistakes identified in the generated article, specifically in the references.Conclusions: The study demonstrates the potential of current AI language models to generate completely fabricated scientific articles. Although the papers look sophisticated and seemingly flawless, expert readers may identify semantic inaccuracies and errors upon closer inspection. We highlight the need for increased vigilance and better detection methods to combat the potential misuse of AI in scientific research. At the same time, it is important to recognize the potential benefits of using AI language models in genuine scientific writing and research, such as manuscript preparation and language editing.",0,0,artificial intelligence; publications; ethics; neurosurgery; ChatGPT; language models; fraudulent medical articles,Article,3

Prominent examples of HDD in biomedical research include omics data with a large number of variables such as many measurements across the genome, proteome, or metabolome, as well as electronic health records data that have large numbers of variables recorded for each patient. The statistical analysis of such data requires knowledge and experience, sometimes of complex methods adapted to the respective research questions.MethodsAdvances in statistical methodology and machine learning methods offer new opportunities for innovative analyses of HDD, but at the same time require a deeper understanding of some fundamental statistical concepts. Topic group TG9 ""High-dimensional data"" of the STRATOS (STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies) initiative provides guidance for the analysis of observational studies, addressing particular statistical challenges and opportunities for the analysis of studies involving HDD. In this overview, we discuss key aspects of HDD analysis to provide a gentle introduction for non-statisticians and for classically trained statisticians with little experience specific to HDD.ResultsThe paper is organized with respect to subtopics that are most relevant for the analysis of HDD, in particular initial data analysis, exploratory data analysis, multiple testing, and prediction. For each subtopic, main analytical goals in HDD settings are outlined. For each of these goals, basic explanations for some commonly used analysis methods are provided. Situations are identified where traditional statistical methods cannot, or should not, be used in the HDD setting, or where adequate analytic tools are still lacking.

As one of the most important features that determine the degree of image's aesthetics quality, color harmony has gained increasing attentions. To overcome the problems of most classical color harmony models, which are heavily relied on heuristic rules and ignore the semantic information of images, we propose a statistical learning framework in this paper to train a color harmony model from a large number of natural images. In this framework, the semantic label information, which indicates the content of each image, along with the visual features is used to facilitate the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) training. Then, the degree of color harmony can be estimated by using supervised/unsupervised models, which is applied to indicate the photo's aesthetics score. By using the proposed color harmony model, we attempt to uncover the underlying principles that generate pleasing color combinations based on natural images. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the conventional heuristic color harmony models for image aesthetics assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Unsupervised approaches for measuring textual similarity between legal court case reports,"Mandal, Arpan; Ghosh, Kripabandhu; Ghosh, Saptarshi; Mandal, Sekhar; SPRINGER; Mandal, Arpan; Mandal, Sekhar; Ghosh, Kripabandhu; Ghosh, Saptarshi; Mandal, Arpan; Ghosh, Saptarshi; Mandal, Arpan; Mandal, Arpan",2021,ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LAW,10.1007/s10506-020-09280-2,WOS:000604797500001,India,"In the domain of legal information retrieval, an important challenge is to compute similarity between two legal documents. Precedents (statements from prior cases) play an important role in The Common Law system, where lawyers need to frequently refer to relevant prior cases. Measuring document similarity is one of the most crucial aspects of any document retrieval system which decides the speed, scalability and accuracy of the system. Text-based and network-based methods for computing similarity among case reports have already been proposed in prior works but not without a few pitfalls. Since legal citation networks are generally highly disconnected, network based metrics are not suited for them. Till date, only a few text-based and predominant embedding based methods have been employed, for instance, TF-IDF based approaches, Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013) and Doc2Vec (Le and Mikolov 2014) based approaches. We investigate the performance of 56 different methodologies for computing textual similarity across court case statements when applied on a dataset of Indian Supreme Court Cases. Among the 56 different methods, thirty are adaptations of existing methods and twenty-six are our proposed methods. The methods studied include models such as BERT (Devlin et al. 2018) and Law2Vec (Ilias 2019). It is observed that the more traditional methods (such as the TF-IDF and LDA) that rely on a bag-of-words representation performs better than the more advanced context-aware methods (like BERT and Law2Vec) for computing document-level similarity. Finally we nominate, via empirical validation, five of our best performing methods as appropriate for measuring similarity between case reports. Among these five, two are adaptations of existing methods and the other three are our proposed methods.",0,0,Legal information retrieval; Court case reports; Court case similarity; Topic modeling; Word2vec; Doc2vec; BERT; Law2vec,Article,4

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the long-term effects of the accumulation of GBCA in the body. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of using texture analysis in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and machine learning algorithms to discriminate active from inactive MS lesions without the use of GBCA.Methods: To achieve this purpose, we introduce an image processing pipeline. In the proposed pipeline, following registration and alignment of slices, MS lesions from DWI images are segmented and quantized. Next, different texture analysis methods are employed to extract texture features from the lesions. Then, a two-stage feature reduction method is applied, in which the first stage involves a statistical t-test and the second stage relies on principal component analysis (PCA), sequential forward selection (SFS), sequential backward selection (SBS), and ReliefF algorithms. Finally, we use five classifiers logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K nearest neighbor (KNN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in a 5-fold cross-validation procedure to determine active and inactive MS lesions.Results: In this study, we collected and prepared 255 active/inactive MS lesions from MRI scans of 34 patients diagnosed with MS, with a mean age of 35.56 +/- 10.89. Among 89 texture features extracted, 63 features showed statistically significant differences between the means of active and inactive lesions (P<0.05). The SVM classifier with the PCA feature reduction algorithm demonstrated the best performance with an average accuracy of 0.960 (+/- 0.024), specificity and precision of 1.0, sensitivity of 0.913 (+/- 0.053), and AUC of 0.957 (+/- 0.027).Conclusion: Our study indicates that DWI changes detected using texture analysis-based machine learning models can precisely differentiate active from inactive MS lesions.

Recent research findings have reported that at least 10 % of all studies that are funded by major research funding agencies terminate without yielding useful results. Since it is well-known that scientific studies that receive funding from major funding agencies are carefully planned, and rigorously vetted through the peer-review process, it was somewhat daunting to us that study-terminations are this prevalent. Moreover, our review of the literature about study terminations suggested that the reasons for study terminations are not well understood. We therefore aimed to address that knowledge gap, by seeking to identify the factors that contribute to study failures. Method We used data from the repository, from which we extracted both structured data (study characteristics), and unstructured data (the narrative description of the studies). We applied natural language processing techniques to the unstructured data to quantify the risk of termination by identifying distinctive topics that are more frequently associated with trials that are terminated and trials that are completed. We used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique to derive 25 ""topics"" with corresponding sets of probabilities, which we then used to predict study-termination by utilizing random forest modeling. We fit two distinct models - one using only structured data as predictors and another model with both structured data and the 25 text topics derived from the unstructured data. Results In this paper, we demonstrate the interpretive and predictive value of LDA as it relates to predicting clinical trial failure. The results also demonstrate that the combined modeling approach yields robust predictive probabilities in terms of both sensitivity and specificity, relative to a model that utilizes the structured data alone. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that the use of topic modeling using LDA significantly raises the utility of unstructured data in better predicating the completion vs. termination of studies.

For breast mass classification into the benign or malignant category, an enhanced automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) model is suggested in this work, enabling radiologists to identify breast diseases correctly in less time. First, a fast discrete curvelet transform with wrapping (FDCT-WRP) is deployed to extract the curve-like features and create a feature set. Then, a combined feature reduction strategy called principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used to produce more relevant and reduced feature sets. Finally, a new enhanced learning algorithm called MODPSO-ELM incorporates modified particle swarm optimization (MODPSO) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) proposed for the classification task. In the MODPSO-ELM algorithm, MODPSO is utilized to optimize the hidden node parameters (input weights and hidden biases) of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks (SLFN) and analytically determined the output weight. The proposed CAD model has been evaluated on three standard datasets with a 10 xk-fold stratified cross-validation (SCV) test.

Electronic properties of the channel materials are evaluated using the local density approximation (LDA) in density functional theory (DFT). For phonon dispersion we employ the small displacement / frozen phonon calculations in DFT. Thereafter using the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism, we study the effect of electron-phonon scattering and the contribution of various phonon modes on the performance of such devices. It is found that the performance of the WSe2 device is less impacted by phonon scattering, showing a ballisticity of 83% for 1L-WSe2 FET for channel length of 10 nm. Though 1L-MoS2 FET of similar dimension shows a lesser ballisticity of 75%. Also in the presence of scattering there exist a a 21-36% increase in the intrinsic delay time (tau) and a 10-18% reduction in peak transconductance (g(m)) for WSe2 and MoS2 devices respectively.

The research concludes that the research tool system of China's hog price control is formed. The overall design of the hog price control policy is relatively reasonable, but there are still the following problems: the subject of China's pig price control policy is singular, so it is difficult to form a resultant force; the policy pays attention to the price regulation in the short term, but ignores the long-term industrial structure adjustment; it emphasizes market supervision, but insufficient support for slaughtering and processing; it focuses on production and management to improve the development quality and efficiency of the pig industry, but does not take social equity into account. Finally, some policy suggestions are put forward: multi-department division of labor and close cooperation; adjusting the industrial structure of hog and carrying out appropriate large-scale breeding; establishing the operation mode of slaughtering and processing in the producing area to reduce the circulation cost of the pig industry; ensuring the consumption of pork by low-income groups and giving consideration to social efficiency and equity.",0,0,food price; pig price; food policy control; text mining; PMC index model,Article,2

Periodically, the system records any intrusion action or breach, which frequently modifies the administrator. Cyber Physical System (CPS) is particularly called as networked connected system, in which the system components are spatially distributed and integrated via the communication network. The control mechanism ensures computation significance; however, the system does affect attacks. Researchers are trying to handle this issue via the existing anomaly datasets. In this way, this paper follows an intrusion detection system under three major stages including extraction of features, selection of feature, and detection. The primary stage is the extraction of Statistical features like standard deviation, mean, mode, variance, and median, as well as higher-order statistical features like moment, percentile, improved correlation, kurtosis, mutual information, skewness, flow-based features, and information gain-based features. The curse of dimensionality becomes a significant problem in this scenario, so it is crucial to choose the right features. Improved Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is utilized to choose the right features. The selected features are subjected to a Hybrid classifier for final detection. Here, models like CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) and Bi-GRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) are combined. A new Bernoulli Map Estimated Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (BMEAOA) is added to train the system by adjusting the ideal weights of the two classifiers, leading to improved detection outcomes.

However, the translational significance remains unclear. Human engineered heart tissues (EHTs) provide a means of quantifying the effects of chronic oc1A-AR stimulation on human cardiomyocyte physiology. EHTs were created from thin slices of decellularized pig myocardium seeded with human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. With a paired experi-mental design, EHTs were cultured for 3 wk, mechanically tested, cultured again for 2 wk with oc1A-AR agonist A61603 (10 nM) or vehi-cle control, and retested after drug washout for 24 h. Separate control experiments determined the effects of EHT age (3-5 wk) or repeat mechanical testing. We found that chronic A61603 treatment caused a 25% increase of length-dependent activation (LDA) of contraction compared with vehicle treatment (n = 7/group, P = 0.035). EHT force was not increased after chronic A61603 treatment. However, after vehicle treatment, EHT force was increased by 35% relative to baseline testing (n = 7/group, P = 0.022), suggesting EHT maturation. Control experiments suggested that increased EHT force resulted from repeat mechanical testing, not from EHT aging. RNA-seq analysis confirmed that the oc1A-AR is expressed in human EHTs and found chronic A61603 treatment affected gene expression in biological pathways known to be activated by oc1A-ARs, including the MAP kinase signaling pathway. In conclusion, increased LDA in human EHT after chronic A61603 treatment raises the possibility that chronic stimulation of the oc1A-AR might be beneficial for increasing LDA in human myocardium and might be beneficial for treating human heart failure by restoring LDA.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Chronic stimulation of oc1A-adrenergic receptors (oc1A-ARs) is known to mediate therapeutic effects in animal heart failure models.

One of the major detrimental microstructure properties associated with additive manufacturing (AM) is porosity within final parts. State-of-the-art porosity detection methods focus primarily on post-manufacturing approaches that are susceptible to high cost of process, longer process time, and are incapable of characterizing pores during fabrication. A real-time porosity prediction method is developed using morphological characteristics of the melt pool boundary (i.e., features obtained via functional principal component analysis (FPCA)). A thermal monitoring system is used to capture the time varying melt pool signal, which are labeled as either pores or normal melt pools by X-ray tomography. Supervised learning methods are utilized to identify the patterns of melt pool images and build a black-box model for the probability distribution of class labels (namely, porosity) based on data characteristics of predictors (e.g., melt pool characteristics). The resultant model does not depend on specific design of specimens with varying material properties; and can be effectively developed as long as thermal-porosity data can be obtained. In the current study, multiple supervised machine learning approaches are used to classify melt pools to predict porosity in a part. Two different accuracy measures are used and numerical experiments show that among the classification approaches used (i.e., Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)), KNN results in the highest rate of accurately classifying melt pools (98.44%). However, DT results in the lowest rate for incorrectly identifying normal melt pools as pores (0.03%). A comparative study is conducted that compares the performance of supervised learning methods leveraging the proposed morphological model and simple metrics of the melt pool. Numerical experiments show that the morphological model combined with supervised learning techniques vastly outperform the simple melt pool metrics combined with supervised learning techniques (approximately 250% better performance for correctly predicting abnormal melt pools). Our approach may potentially be applied to other AM processes that share similar energy-material interactions (e.g., powder bed fusion, electron beam melting).",8,0,Additive manufacturing; Supervised learning; Thermal history; Porosity prediction; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; DECISION TREE CLASSIFICATION; RAY COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; NEURAL NETWORKS; FACE DETECTION; WATER-CONTENT; POOL; TEMPERATURE; TRANSFORM; MECHANISM,Article,5

Microorganisms are key players in the functioning and service of soil ecosystems, but the effects of Cd-contaminated ginseng growth on these microorganisms is still poorly understood. To study this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of microorganisms and Cd (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg kg(-1) of Cd) exposure on the soil microbial community using Illumina HiSeq high-throughput sequencing. Results Our results indicated that Cd-contaminated soil affected the soil microbial diversity and composition, and bacterial diversity was affected more than fungal diversity in Cd-contaminated soil, especially according to Shannon indices. The abundance of the soil microbial community decreased and the composition changed according to the relative abundances at the phylum level, including those of Saccharibacteria and Gemmatimonadetes in bacteria and Mortierellomycota in fungi. The LEfSe algorithm was used to identify active biomarkers, and 45 differentially abundant bacterial taxonomic clades and 16 differentially abundant fungal taxonomic clades were identified with LDA scores higher than 4.0. Finally, a heatmap of Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) indicated that some key biomarkers, Arenimonas, Xanthomonadales, Nitrosomonadaceae, Methylophilales, Caulobacterales, Aeromicrobium, Chitinophagaceae, Acidimicrobiales, Nocardioidaceae, Propionibacteriales, Frankiales, and Gemmatimonadaceae, were positively correlated with the total and available Cd (p<0.05) but negatively correlated with AK, AP, and pH (p<0.05) in the bacterial community. Similarly, in the fungal community, Tubaria, Mortierellaceae, and Rhizophagus were positively correlated with the total and available Cd but negatively correlated with AK, AP, TK, and pH. Conclusion Cd contamination significantly affected microbial diversity and composition in ginseng-growing soil.

In recent years, increasing attention has been paid to this highly lethal virus due to sporadic outbreaks observed in various African nations. This bibliometric analysis endeavors to elucidate the trends, dynamics, and focal points of knowledge that have delineated the landscape of research concerning MARV. Methods: Relevant literature on MARV from 1968 to 2023 was extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Following this, the data underwent bibliometric analysis and visualization procedures utilizing online analysis platform, CiteSpace 6.2R6, and VOSviewer 1.6.20. Three different types of bibliometric indicators including quantitative indicator, qualitative indicators, and structural indicators were used to gauge a researcher's productivity, assess the quality of their work, and analyze publication relationships, respectively. Results: MARV is mainly prevalent in Africa. And approximately 643 confirmed cases have been described in the literature to date, and mortality observed was 81.2 % in overall patients. A total of 1014 papers comprising 869 articles and 145 reviews were included. The annual publications showed an increasing growth pattern from 1968 to 2023 (R2 = 0.8838). The United States stands at the forefront of this discipline, having dedicated substantial financial and human resources to scientific inquiry. However, co-authorship analysis showed the international research collaboration needs to be further strengthened. Based on reference and keywords analysis, contemporary MARV research encompasses pivotal areas: primarily, prioritizing the creation of prophylactic vaccines to impede viral spread, and secondarily, exploring targeted antiviral strategies, including small-molecule antivirals or MARV-specific monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, a comprehensive grasp of viral transmission, transcription, and replication mechanisms remains a central focus in ongoing investigations. And future MARV studies are expected to focus on evaluating clinical trial safety and efficacy, developing inhibitors to contain viral spread, exploring vaccine immunogenicity, virus-host association studies, and elucidating the role of neutralizing antibodies in MARV treatment.

Therefore, it is necessary to preprocess the source data in order to improve data quality and improve the data mining results. Different types of data require different processing technologies. Most structured data commonly needs classic preprocessing technologies, including data cleansing, data integration, data transformation, and data reduction. For semistructured or unstructured data, such as medical text, containing more health information, it requires more complex and challenging processing methods.

The effects of violence and related stress on asthma,"Han, Yueh-Ying; Celedo, Juan C.; Celedo, Juan C.; ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC; Celedo, Juan C.; Celedo, Juan C.; Celedo, Juan C.; Celedon, Juan C.",2024,ANNALS OF ALLERGY ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGY,10.1016/j.anai.2024.07.023,WOS:001372217900001,USA,"In the United States, people living in deprived urban areas and persons in certain minoritized groups are often exposed to violence and affected with asthma, and epidemiologic studies have shown a link between exposure to violence (ETV) and asthma throughout the lifespan. Indeed, ETV at the individual, intrafamilial and community levels has been linked to asthma in children and adults. In this review, we discuss the evidence for a causal relation between ETV and asthma, emphasizing findings published in the last five years. Interpretation of the available evidence is limited by variable quality of the assessment of ETV or asthma, potential recall and selection bias, inability to estimate the relative contribution of various types of violence to the observed associations, lack of objective biomarkers of asthma or asthma endotypes, and inconsistent consideration of potential confounders or modifiers of the ETV-asthma link. Despite such limitations, the aggregate evidence from studies conducted in different locations and populations suggests that ETV affects asthma and asthma outcomes, and that this is explained by direct physiologic effects of violence-related distress and indirect effects (e.g., through risky health behaviors or co-morbidities). Thus, large prospective studies with careful assessment of specific types of ETV, key covariates and comorbidities (including mental illness), and asthma are needed to advance this field. Such research efforts should not preclude screening for maltreatment in children with asthma and ETV-related depression and anxiety in adolescents and adults with asthma. Further, vigorous policies are needed to curtail violence, as such policies could benefit patients with asthma while saving lives. (c) 2024 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Nursing consultations vary widely across settings and countries, and their activities range from complementing to substituting traditional physician-led consultations or usual care. Objective: This study was aimed at describing the effects of nursing consultations with patients with complex conditions in any setting on patient outcomes (quality of life, physical status, psychosocial health, health behaviour, medication adherence, mortality, anthropometric and physiological outcomes, and patient satisfaction) and organisational outcomes (health resource use and costs). Design: Umbrella review. Methods: We followed the Joanna Briggs Institute method for umbrella reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published in English, Dutch, French, Spanish or German between January 2013 and February 2023. We included systematic literature reviews, with or without meta-analyses, that included randomised controlled trials conducted in high-income countries. Reviews were eligible if they pertained to consultations led by specialised nurses or advanced nurse practitioners. Article selection, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed independently by at least two reviewers. Results: We included 50 systematic reviews based on 473 unique trials. For all patient outcomes, nursing consultations achieved effects at least equivalent to those of physician-led consultations or usual care (i.e., non- inferiority). For quality of life, health behaviour, medication adherence, mortality and patient satisfaction, more than half the meta-analyses found statistically significant effects in favour of nursing consultations (i.e., superiority). Cost results must be interpreted with caution, because very few and heterogeneous cost-related data were extracted, and the methodological quality of the cost analyses was questionable. Narrative syntheses confirmed the overall conclusions of the meta-analyses. Conclusions: The effects of nursing consultations on patients with complex health conditions across healthcare settings appear to be at least similar to physician-led consultations or usual care. Nursing consultations appear to be more effective than physician-led consultations or usual care in terms of quality of life, health behaviour, mortality, patient satisfaction and medication adherence. Further analysis of the primary data is necessary to determine the patient populations and settings in which nursing consultations are most effective. Moderate study quality, diversity amongst and within systematic reviews, and quality of reporting hamper the strength of the findings. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

Lymph node density as a prognostic marker of relapse in patients who underwent primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection,"Chavarriaga, Julian; Mousa, Ahmad; Atenafu, Eshetu G.; Anson-Cartwright, Lynn; Langleben, Carley; Jewett, Michael; Hamilton, Robert J.; ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC; Chavarriaga, Julian; Chavarriaga, Julian; Mousa, Ahmad; Anson-Cartwright, Lynn; Langleben, Carley; Jewett, Michael; Hamilton, Robert J.; Atenafu, Eshetu G.; Chavarriaga, Julian; Chavarriaga, Julian; Atenafu, Eshetu; Mousa, Ahmed",2024,UROLOGIC ONCOLOGY-SEMINARS AND ORIGINAL INVESTIGATIONS,10.1016/j.urolonc.2024.07.012,WOS:001359480200001,Colombia; Canada,"Introduction: Primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (pRPLND) is a treatment option for clinical stage (CS) II testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) and CS I with retroperitoneal relapse. Increasing raw lymph node yield during pRPLND has been associated a decreased relapse risk. However, this metric has limitations due to variations in surgical templates and specimen processing methods. We aimed to evaluate the lymph node density (LND), which is the ratio of positive lymph nodes to the total number of nodes removed, as a prognostic marker for relapse after pRPLND. Methods: We reviewed all patients who underwent pRPLND at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between 1990 and 2022. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS). RFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. The log-rank test was used to assess the impact of LND, and recursive binary partitioning was used to determine the threshold LND that provides optimum separation in RFS. Results: In this study, 178 patients were treated with pRPLND. A total of 137 (77%) patients had pathological evidence of nodal metastasis, 96 were treated with open RPLND, and 41 with robotic RPLND. The median number of lymph nodes harvested was 32 (IQR 23-43) and median total positive nodes was 2 (IQR 1-36). This translated into a median LND of 3.1% (IQR 1.7-57.1). There was no significant difference in the LND between robotic and open approaches (P = 0.6664). After a median follow-up of 38.6 months, 11 patients (8.02%) had relapsed. LND was not significantly associated with relapse (HR 1.018, 95% CI, 0.977-1.061). The optimal threshold to dichotomize LND that provides optimum separation in RFS was >= 26.75%, however, it did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.0651). Conclusion: In conclusion, the LND was not associated with RFS after pRPLND in patients with TGCTs. The unique characteristics of TGCTs and the presence of other established risk factors limit the utility of the LND alone in predicting relapse. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesize that thyroidectomy websites have low quality and are written above the 6th grade readability recommendation. Methods: A systematic literature review of studies evaluating readability and/or quality of thyroidectomy-informing, English-written websites was performed in November 2023 in three major online databases (Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science). Results: Ten out of 2017 initially screened studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies found websites' readability above the recommended 6th grade level. Quality was heterogeneously defined and evaluated by seven of the included studies. Nonetheless, all studies deemed most thyroidectomy websites quality as poor to fair. Conclusions: Websites addressing thyroidectomy do not meet the recommended readability level for patient educational material. The heterogeneity of scoring and reporting of quality limits comparability. This study highlights the necessity of revising and modifying existing websites to adequately aid patient decision-making.

Methods: A professional research librarian carried out literature searches for all sections of the urolithiasis guidelines, covering the timeframe between 1976 and June 2023. Key findings and limitations: For every patient with urolithiasis, an attempt should be made to analyse the stone. Patients should be given general instructions on how to prevent recurrence, including adequate fluid and calcium intake, and low consumption of sodium and protein. Identifying and correcting the causative factors is a cornerstone in preventing the recurrence of urolithiasis. Diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms by stone composition are available. Every patient should undergo baseline metabolic screening, while patients with calcium stones, who are at high risk of relapse and complications, should undergo extensive metabolic screening with two 24-h urine collections and should receive targeted therapy. Patients with uric acid, infection, or cystine stones are at high risk of relapse. All patients at high risk of recurrence should be closely monitored, especially those not complying with therapy in the long term. Conclusions and clinical implications: Metabolic stone evaluation and patient follow-up are highly recommended to prevent urolithiasis recurrence. (c) 2024 European Association of Urology.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to assess long-term outcomes of extensor indicis proprius to EPL tendon transfers for patients following distal radius fracture and EPL tendon repair. Study Design: Retrospective case series focusing on long-term clinical outcomes. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted for patients who sustained a distal radius fracture and subsequently underwent extensor tendon transfer from 2005-2015 at a private practice center. Outcome measures including index finger (IF) metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and thumb interphalangeal (IP) active range of motion (ROM), digital extension against resistance, subjective complaints, and QuickDASH scores were recorded at final follow-up. Results: Seven patients were included in the study. There were six females and one male subject, mean age of 54 +/- 13 years at injury of EPL, and 5/7 involved the left upper extremity. For isolated function, 7/7 (100%) patients had isolated, active IF MCP extension, 6/7 (86%) could extend IF MCP and thumb IP against resistance. Mean IF MCP extension was 1 degrees +/- 2 degrees, mean IF MCP flexion was 89 degrees +/- 2 degrees, mean thumb IP extension was -5 degrees +/- 4 degrees, and mean thumb IP flexion was 67 degrees +/- 15 degrees.

However, the incidence and risk factors for gastric cancer (GC) are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of GC and associated risk factors in a large FAP population. Methods: Retrospective review of patients with FAP undergoing upper endoscopy at Mayo Clinic from 1989 to 2023. Cumulative incidence of GC (95% CIs) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival approaches. Associations of clinical characteristics with development of GC were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: A total of 337 patients underwent 2502 endoscopies with a median of 10.4 years (IQR, 3.9-17.2) of endoscopic surveillance. At any time during surveillance, 294 patients (87%) had gastric polyps; 200 (59%), fundic gland polyps; 116 (34%), low-grade dysplasia (LGD); and 11 (3.3%), high-grade dysplasia (HGD). Among these, only 6 patients (2%) developed GC-5 with HGD (3 [50%] on previous endoscopy and 2 [33%] at the time of cancer diagnosis) and 1 (16%) with LGD on previous endoscopy. The 10-year cumulative incidence of GC is 0% with no polyps, 1% with polyps, 6% with LGD, 11% with polyps >= 2 cm, and 20% with HGD. Both HGD and polyps >= 2 cm had a strong association with the development of GC (P < .001). Conclusion: Although the overall risk of GC in FAP is low, outcomes remain poor. GC can be predicted by endoscopic findings and specific GC surveillance guidelines are imperative to improve detection rates and guide timely intervention.

Such fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) demand for enhanced analytical methodologies and tools to efficiently achieve quality control of these complex products as compared to the conventional products containing only one active constituent. Highly efficient analytical methods can measure multiple constituents at once, improving their quality control. This review article discusses the challenges in the development of such methods due to the similarities or differences in the chemical identity of the participating drug molecules in an FDC. The latest developments in multiple analyte determination using various analytical techniques (HPLC, LC-MS, NMR, IR, powder XRD and DSC) are discussed, with a focus on special considerations in each case. The article discusses challenges with sample preparation of complex FDC products, and the use of Chemometrics and Quality by Design to develop efficient analytical methods. Lastly, an equation-based approach is proposed and demonstrated to arrive at a parameter referred to as ""percentage efficiency gain"" that would be useful in directly accessing the relevance and commercial benefits of a simultaneous method vis-a-vis separate methods for individual components.

Methods: Guided by the ""6S"" pyramid model, we retrieved evidence on fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance management from relevant websites and databases, and unpublished gray literature was also searched. The time frame of the search ranged from database establishment to September 30, 2023. Two researchers independently evaluated the literature quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) for guidelines, and the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews II (AMSTAR II) for systematic reviews. Two people independently extracted and summarized the evidence according to the first principle of high-quality evidence and newly published evidence. The included evidence was graded by the JBI Evidence Pre-Grading System. Results: A total of 52,238 articles were retrieved, of which 60 articles, including 18 guidelines, 18 JBI best practice recommendations, one Up To Date clinical practice, and 23 systematic reviews, were included. Overall, 49 pieces of evidence from six dimensions-screening, assessment, management, education, referral, and follow-up-were summarized. Forty-three pieces of evidence were level 1, three pieces of evidence were level 4, and three pieces of evidence were level 5. Conclusions: The best 49 pieces of evidence on nonpharmacological interventions for the fatigue-pain-sleep disturbance symptom cluster in lung cancer patients were summarized in this study, and these nonpharmacological interventions are scientific and comprehensive. Implications for Nursing Practice: This study can provide guidance for clinical team to improve the fatigue-pain-sleep disturbance symptom cluster management.

The databases PubMed, Lilacs, Web of Science, Embase, SciELO, Scopus, EBSCO, Cochrane, and Google Scholar were surveyed and the study was registered on the PROSPERO (CRD42022383594). The selected studies met the criteria established by the PICO model: 1: Population - individuals over 18 years of age with class III dentofacial skeletal deformities; 2: Intervention - orthognathic surgery using BSSO; 3: Comparison - condylar tomographic measurements (volume, thickness, height, and width) prior to the surgical procedure; and 4: Results - condylar tomographic measurements (volume, thickness, height, and width) at least 12 months after surgery. Initially, 800 articles were identified. After excluding 694 duplicates and screening 153, nine studies met the inclusion criteria for data extraction and analysis. Six evaluated class III symmetrical individuals, and three assessed those with mandibular asymmetry. A total of 233 patients (92 males and 141 females) were studied. Analysis of 466 condyles revealed minimal bone remodelling, with resorption averaging from- 0.03 to- 0.94 mm and apposition from 0.01 to 0.34 mm. Data analysis showed minimal changes in condylar morphology post BSSO with or without maxillary surgery, indicating predictable skeletal stability. Bias (ACROBAT-NRSI guidelines) did not affect data reliability, and no occlusal changes were observed. The main limitations of the study were heterogeneous imaging techniques, varied study designs, diverse populations, and inconsistent protocols. Further trials with standardised cone-beam computed tomography are needed to enhance remodelling and volume measurement reliability.

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following the PRISMA framework. A comprehensive literature search using the PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was performed until July 2023. Eligible studies included patients with clinically localised PCa initially treated with FT, who experienced relapse during surveillance and subsequently underwent salvage radical prostatectomy (sRP), salvage external beam radiation therapy (sEBRT) or salvage focal therapy (sFT). The primary endpoint was the biochemical recurrence rate post-salvage treatment. The secondary endpoints were functional outcomes, including urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction rates. Results: In 26 retrospective studies including 990 patients, the overall pooled biochemical recurrence rate postsalvage treatment was 26%. The subgroup analysis revealed a biochemical recurrence rate of 20%, 22%, and 42% after sRP, sEBRT, and sFT, respectively. The overall pooled rate of urinary incontinence was 20%. Salvage FT had the lowest prevalence of urinary incontinence, followed by sRP and sEBRT. The overall pooled rate of erectile dysfunction was 43%. Salvage RP had the highest prevalence of erectile dysfunction, followed by sFT and sEBRT. Substantial heterogeneity was observed among the studies, primarily due to different sample sizes. Meta-regression analysis revealed no to low contributions of salvage treatment modalities, extent of ablation, age, prostatic specific antigen level before salvage treatment, proportion of patients with Gleason score >= 7 at recurrence, and time between the primary and salvage therapies to heterogeneity. Conclusion: Salvage local treatment for recurrent PCa after FT is feasible, and it provides acceptable oncological and functional outcomes. Among all treatment modalities, sRP and sEBRT appeared to have the lowest biochemical recurrence rates, whereas sFT was associated with improved functional outcomes. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

We have analyzed Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service data to observe changes in claim patterns of pediatric appendectomy during this period. Methods: All claims data for appendectomy of patients younger than 18 y from 2011 to 2015 were collected. We analyzed the following factors of all cases: age, gender, length of hospital stay, medical cost, method of insurance claim and region. Results: A total of 112,143 claims were made for appendectomy during the study period. In that, 66,510 (59.3%) were boys and 45,633 (40.7%) were girls. Median length of stay was 5 d and median sum of reimbursement of each claim was 2,198,630 won. Annual number of claims for appendectomy showed a steady decline from 24,888 in 2011 to 19,070 in 2015. Median sum of reimbursement of each claim was 1,862,615, 1,975,500, 2,233,360, 2,376,700, and 2,468,000 won, respectively from 2011 to 2015. Reimbursement for complicated appendectomy increased from 4400 out of 24,888 cases (17.7%) in 2011 to 3865 out of 19,070 cases (20.3%) in 2015. Overall medical cost of all reimbursement for pediatric appendectomy increased from 46,113,202,580 to 47,572,253,300 won. Conclusions: Following the universal enforcement of the diagnosis-related group claim system for appendectomy by the National Health Insurance Service, we observed an increase in the median sum of reimbursement per claim and a rise in the rate of claims for complicated appendectomies. These changes were associated with an overall increase in national medical costs. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

These difficulties are generally attributed to patients' reduced ability to both communicate and understand health-related ideas as well as physicians' lack of skill in identifying those with limited HL. Understanding and identifying patients with barriers posed by lower HL to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes is an important research avenue. However, doing so using traditional methods has proven difficult and infeasible to scale. This study using corpus analyses, expert human ratings of HL, and natural language processing (NLP) approaches to estimate HL at the individual patient level. The goal of the study is to better understand HL from a linguistic perspective and to open new research areas to enhance population management and individualized care. Specifically, this study examines HL as a function of patients' demonstrated ability to communicate health-related information to their providers via secure messages. The study develops an NLP-based HL model and validates the model by predicting patient-related events such as medical outcomes and hospitalizations. Results indicate that the developed model predicts human ratings of HL with similar to 80% accuracy. Validation indicates that lower HL patients are more likely to be nonwhite and have lower educational attainment. In addition, patients with lower HL suffered more negative health outcomes and had higher healthcare service utilization.",1,0,SELF-MANAGEMENT SUPPORT; DIABETES PATIENTS; PHYSICIANS; VALIDATION; STRATEGIES; ADHERENCE; QUALITY; LEXICON; CORPUS; MAIL,Article,2

These methods can be critical in providing high-quality care to patients with chronic rheumatological diseases lacking an optimal treatment, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which is the second most prevalent autoimmune disease. Herein, following reviewing the basic concepts of AI, we summarize the advances in its applications in RA clinical practice and research. We provide directions for future investigations in this field after reviewing the current knowledge gaps and technical and ethical challenges in applying AI. Automated models have been largely used to improve RA diagnosis since the early 2000s, and they have used a wide variety of techniques, e.g., support vector machine, random forest, and artificial neural networks. AI algorithms can facilitate screening and identification of susceptible groups, diagnosis using omics, imaging, clinical, and sensor data, patient detection within electronic health record (EHR), i.e., phenotyping, treatment response assessment, monitoring disease course, determining prognosis, novel drug discovery, and enhancing basic science research. They can also aid in risk assessment for incidence of comorbidities, e.g., cardiovascular diseases, in patients with RA. However, the proposed models may vary significantly in their performance and reliability. Despite the promising results achieved by AI models in enhancing early diagnosis and management of patients with RA, they are not fully ready to be incorporated into clinical practice. Future investigations are required to ensure development of reliable and generalizable algorithms while they carefully look for any potential source of bias or misconduct. We showed that a growing body of evidence supports the potential role of AI in revolutionizing screening, diagnosis, and management of patients with RA. However, multiple obstacles hinder clinical applications of AI models. Incorporating the machine and/or deep learning algorithms into real-world settings would be a key step in the progress of AI in medicine.",0,0,Rheumatoid arthritis; Autoimmune diseases; Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Imaging; Machine learning; Natural language processing; Precision medicine; Treatment; ELECTRONIC MEDICAL-RECORDS; DISEASE-ACTIVITY; HEALTH-CARE; AUTOMATED ASSESSMENT; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; CLINICAL-RESPONSE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; BIG DATA; MACHINE,Review,4

We used IDEAL-X, a novel information extraction software system, to identify VTE from electronic medical records and evaluated its accuracy.Methods:Medical records for 13,248 patients admitted to an orthopedic specialty hospital from 2009 to 2014 were reviewed. Patient encounters were defined as a hospital admission where both surgery (of the spine, hip, or knee) and a radiology diagnostic study that could detect VTE was performed. Radiology reports were both manually reviewed by a physician and analyzed by IDEAL-X.Results:Among 2083 radiology reports, IDEAL-X correctly identified 176/181 VTE events, achieving a sensitivity of 97.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 93.7%-99.1%] and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI, 98.9%-99.7%) when compared with manual review. Among 422 surgical encounters with diagnostic radiographic studies for VTE, IDEAL-X correctly identified 41 of 42 VTE events, achieving a sensitivity of 97.6% (95% CI, 87.4%-99.6%) and specificity of 99.8% (95% CI, 98.7%-100.0%).

Text mining refers to a range of techniques to extract data from narrative sources. The goal of this study was to evaluate the performance of an automated approach for extracting adverse event keywords from within electronic health records. Methods The study involved 4 medical centers in the Region of Lombardy. A starting set of keywords was trained in an iterative process to develop queries for 7 adverse events, including those used by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality as patient safety indicators. We calculated positive predictive values of the 7 queries and performed an error analysis to detect reasons for false-positive cases of pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and urinary tract infection. Results Overall, 397,233 records were collected (34,805 discharge summaries, 292,593 emergency department notes, and 69,835 operation reports). Positive predictive values were higher for postoperative wound dehiscence (83.83%) and urinary tract infection (73.07%), whereas they were lower for deep vein thrombosis (5.37%), pulmonary embolism (13.63%), and postoperative sepsis (12.28%). The most common reasons for false positives were reporting of past events (42.25%), negations (22.80%), and conditions suspected by physicians but not confirmed by a diagnostic test (11.25%).

However, the data analysis and management in IoMT remain challenging owing to the existence of a massive number of devices linked to the server environment, generating a massive quantity of healthcare data. In such cases, cognitive computing can be employed that uses many intelligent technologies-machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP) and others-to comprehend data expansively. Furthermore, breast cancer (BC) has been found to be a major cause of mortality among ladies globally. Earlier detection and classification of BC using digital mammograms can decrease the mortality rate. This paper presents a novel deep learning-enabled multi-objective mayfly optimization algorithm (DLMOMFO) for BC diagnosis and classification in the IoMT environment. The goal of this paper is to integrate deep learning (DL) and cognitive computing-based techniques for e-healthcare applications as a part of IoMT technology to detect and classify BC. The proposed DL-MOMFO algorithm involved Adaptive Weighted Mean Filter (AWMF)-based noise removal and contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE)-based contrast improvement techniques to improve the quality of the digital mammograms. In addition, a U-Net architecture-based segmentation method was utilised to detect diseased regions in the mammograms. Moreover, a SqueezeNet-based feature extraction and a fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) classifier were used in the presented technique. To enhance the diagnostic performance of the presented method, the MOMFO algorithm was used to effectively tune the parameters of the SqueezeNet and FSVM techniques.

Stratified sampling weighted by hospice size to approximate the daily census of US hospice enrollees. Results: Overall caregiver sentiment of hospice care was neutral (S = .14). Therapeutic, achievable expectations and misperceptions, unachievable expectations were, respectively, the most and least prevalent domains. Four topics with the highest prevalence, all had moderately positive sentiments: caring staff, staff professionalism and knowledge; emotional, spiritual, bereavement support; and responsive, timely or helpful. Lowest sentiments scores were lack of staffing; promises made, but not kept, pain, symptoms and medications; sped-up death, hasted, or sedated; and money, staff motivations. Significance of Results: Caregivers overall rating of hospice was neutral, largely due to moderate sentiment on achievable expectations in two-thirds of reviews mixed with unachievable expectations in one-sixth of reviews.

Patient experience is a key aspect that should be gauged and monitored continuously. However, the measurement of such a vital indicator typically cannot be carried out directly, instead being derived from the opinions of patients who usually express their experience in free text. When it comes to patient comments written in the Arabic language, the currently used strategy to classify Arabic comments is totally reliant on human annotation, which is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity and error. Thus, fully using the value of patient feedback in a timely manner is difficult. This paper addresses the problem of classifying patient experience (PX) comments written in Arabic into 25 classes by using deep learning- and BERT-based models. A real-world data set of patient comments is obtained from the Saudi Ministry of Health for this purpose. Features are extracted from the data set, then used to train deep learning-based classifiers-including BiLSTM and BiGRU-for which pre-trained static word embedding and pre-training vector word embeddings are utilized. Furthermore, we utilize several Arabic pre-trained BERT models, in addition to building PX_BERT, a customized BERT model using the PX unlabeled database. From the experimental results for the 28 classifiers built in this study, the best-performing models (based on the F1 score) are found to be PX_BERT and AraBERTv02.

This condition results in abnormal protein deposits building up, causing damage to multiple nerves (polyneuropathy) and other organs, which can shorten lifespan and have other harmful effects. Polyneuropathy symptoms include weakness, numbness, pain, dizziness, and diarrhea. Over time, everyday activities become more difficult as patients become increasingly disabled and dependent on others. Several treatments have been approved for the polyneuropathy of ATTRv amyloidosis. Many of these work in different ways to impact the disease process. An indirect treatment comparison is a well-established statistical method used by healthcare decision-makers to compare treatments when head-to-head trials are unavailable. Indirect treatment comparisons using a common approach, the Bucher method, yield similar conclusions to head-to-head studies over 90% of the time. This method was used to compare clinical trial data for tafamidis and vutrisiran, two approved treatments for ATTRv amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The findings show that vutrisiran is more effective than tafamidis at addressing the polyneuropathy of ATTRv amyloidosis as measured by changes to sensory or motor nervous system functioning and nutritional status. Also, vutrisiran showed greater maintenance of health-related quality of life compared to tafamidis. The expected benefits of vutrisiran over tafamidis are large enough to be noticeable and clinically meaningful to a patient or clinician.

The recently developed deep learning (DL) models can be used for several processes such as classification, natural language processing, etc. This study presents a bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) based convolutional neural network-gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) with class imbalance handling (CIH) model, named BFO-CNN-GRU-CIH for medical data classification in IoT enabled cloud environment. The proposed BFO-CNN-GRU-CIH model initially enables the IoT devices to gather healthcare data and preprocess it for further processing. In addition, Lempel Ziv Markov chain Algorithm (LZMA) is employed for the compression of healthcare data to reduce the amount of data being communicated. Besides, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is applied to handle class imbalance data problems. Moreover, BFO with CNN-GRU model is utilized to perform the classification process in which the hyperparameters of the CNN-GRU model are optimally adjusted by the use of BFO algorithm. In order to showcase the better performance of the BFOCNN-GRU-CIH model, a wide range of simulations take place on three benchmark datasets and the results portrayed the betterment of the BFO-CNNGRU-CIH model over the recent state of art approaches.",0,0,IoT; cloud; healthcare; deep learning; parameter tuning; class imbalance handling; SYSTEM,Article,3

Neural-network based adaptive context prediction model for ambient intelligence,"Kim, Joo-Chang; Chung, Kyungyong; SPRINGER HEIDELBERG; Kim, Joo-Chang; Chung, Kyungyong; Chung, Kyungyong; Chung, Kyungyong; Joochang, Kim",2020,JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING,10.1007/s12652-018-0972-3,WOS:000520835600011,South Korea,"To overcome the limitations of the conventional medical service in terms of ageing and chronic diseases, AmI-based precision medicine has drawn particular attention. Precision medicine is a customized personal medical service using various information technologies such as personal health device, AI algorithm, image recognition, voice recognition, and natural language processing. In particular, the information technologies for follow-up care services for patients, such as context awareness, context information, and inference rules, are required. In PHD, contexts such as variable data include blood pressure, BMI, blood sugar, weather, and food. It has time-series characteristics, meaning that it changes often with time. Other kinds of health-related information, such as age, family history, smoking, and residential area, are intermittently changed. For inference that is highly related to a user, the context collected through AmI is presented with ontology. Ontology consists of a user's ambient data, weather data, and lifelog. Context is changed along with a user's ambient conditions and time. An inference engine is used to create the knowledge base and predict a change. This study proposes a neural-network based adaptive context prediction model for ambient intelligence. This is a learning model using neural network to calculate the similarity for recommendation in a mining lifecare platform. In a conventional prediction procedure, an error is used to update a weight. The proposed model learns the similarity weight of the users to become adapted to the user's ambient. Based on the knowledge base, user clustering and deviation from mean are applied to calculate the similarity weight. Collaborative filtering technology is used to predict a user's context and learn the similarity weight repeatedly using a neural network. According to the performance evaluation, the proposed neural-network based similarity weight method had the highest accuracy of prediction when the learning rate was 0.001. Consequently, we found that AmI is a new added-value technology to maintain a healthy lifestyle and contributes to developing the healthcare industry and improving the quality of life.",2,0,Data mining; Neural network; Intelligence of Things; Context Computing; Ambient intelligence; SERVICE; SYSTEM,Article,3

Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used in various domains, including banking, healthcare, manufacturing, energy management, security, trade or insurance. However, building reliable ML models is challenging. First, because in order to build prediction models by ML algorithms, massive amounts of pre-processed data are needed, but in practice, such datasets are scarce or require a tremendous amount of time to be prepared. Second, because once a model is built, its performance needs to be assessed. To this end, benchmarks are needed, but their availability is limited as well. Despite the fact that ML algorithms are used in multiple domains, their application to the legal domain so far has received little attention from research communities. This fact motivated us to run a project to build and make available an open repository called the European Court of Human Rights Open Data (ECHR-OD) of judgment documents. In this paper, we describe a step-by-step Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process, supported with code snippets, for building ECHR-OD, so that it can be easily reproduced. The process produces (almost) exhaustive datasets that have been transformed, homogenized, re-organized, cleaned beforehand, and made available in a suitable format for ML algorithms. The ECHR-OD repository makes available tabular descriptive features as well as features extracted from natural language documents, accessible via a web user interface. Moreover, we provide a self-contained and easily reproducible set of experiments assessing ML classification algorithms on the content of the ECHR-OD repository. To the best of our knowledge, the ETL process and the set of experiments form the first fully end-to-end, from ingesting and pre-processing legal documents to obtaining high quality ML models, open, and reproducible benchmark on the prediction of the European Court of Human Rights judgments. Both components, the ETL and the experiments, leverage Docker for reproducibility.

Given an relation R = (U, A) and any cut alpha(a) on the hierarchy for every attribute a, there is another rough relation R-Phi , where Phi = (alpha(a): a subset of A). This paper will establish the connection between the functional dependencies in R and R-Phi(,) propose the method for extracting reducts in R-Phi, and demonstrate the implementation of proposed method on an application in data mining of association rules. The method for acquiring association rules consists of the following three steps: (1) translating natural texts into relations, by NLP; (2) translating relations into rough ones, by attributes analysis or fuzzy k-means (FKM) clustering; and (3) extracting association rules from concept lattices, by formal concept analysis (FCA).

However, access to adequate care remains a challenge, particularly for underserved communities with limited resources. Text mining tools offer immense potential to support mental healthcare by assisting professionals in diagnosing and treating patients. This study addresses the scarcity of Arabic mental health resources for developing such tools. We introduce MentalQA, a novel Arabic dataset featuring questioning-answering (QA) style, including a total of 1000 annotations. To ensure data quality, we conducted a rigorous annotation process using a well-defined schema with quality control measures. Data was collected from a question-answering medical platform. The annotation schema for mental health questions and corresponding answers draws upon existing classification schemes with some modifications. Question types encompass six distinct categories: diagnosis, treatment, anatomy & physiology, epidemiology, healthy lifestyle, and provider choice. Answer strategies include information provision, direct guidance, and emotional support. Three experienced annotators collaboratively annotated the data to ensure consistency. Our findings demonstrate high inter-annotator agreement, with Fleiss' Kappa of 0.61 for question types and 0.98 for answer strategies. Our in-depth analysis uncovered insightful patterns in patients behavior and doctor responses. We found a link between the types of questions asked and the strategies doctors use in their answers. Both genders focused on treatment-related questions, though with some variation in emphasis. Interestingly, the types of questions asked also differed by age group. Patients tended to express negative emotions in their questions, while doctors maintained a neutral tone in their responses. Finally, we observed differences in how long it took doctors to answer and the number of words they used depending on the type of question. MentalQA offers a valuable foundation for developing Arabic text mining tools capable of supporting mental health professionals and individuals seeking information.",2,0,Annotations; Mental health; Medical services; Task analysis; Medical diagnostic imaging; Depression; Collaboration; Corpus creation; mental health; natural language processing; question-answering; questions classification,Article,2

Previous studies have observed mental health problems, including substance use, as a prominent antecedent before death. The purpose of this study was to explore the characteristics of nurses who died by suicide documented in the death investigation narratives from the National Violent Death Reporting System from 2003 to 2017 using thematic analysis and natural language processing. One thousand three hundred and fifty-eight subjects met these inclusion criteria. Narratives from 601 subjects were thematically analyzed and 2544 individual narratives were analyzed using natural language processing. The analyses revealed five themes: ""mental health treatment,"" ""poor general health and chronic pain,"" ""substance use,"" ""worsening mental health after bereavement,"" and ""repeating a family member's suicide."" Mental health/substance use, chronic illness, and chronic pain were seen to coexist in a complex, interdependent manner that appeared to be entangled in the nurses' narratives before death. These findings echo the need for reducing the stigmatization of mental health problems in nursing and removing barriers to help-seeking behaviors as early preventative interventions. Future research is needed to determine if a comprehensive healthcare integration approach to address these entangled problems would reduce suicide vulnerability in nurses and improve their quality of life.",0,0,chronic pain; depression; mental health; natural language processing; nurse; occupational stress; substance-related disorders; suicide; SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS; CARE; PROFESSIONALS; PREVALENCE; FACILITIES; SEEKING; RISK,Article,1

Understanding metachronous cancer risk is poor due to lack of accurate large-volume datasets. We outline the use of natural language processing (NLP) in forming the Partners Colonoscopy Cohort, an integrated longitudinal cohort of patients undergoing colonoscopies. Methods We identified endoscopy quality data from endoscopy reports for colonoscopies performed from 2007 to 2018 in a large integrated healthcare system, Mass General Brigham). Through modification of an established NLP pipeline, we extracted histopathological data (polyp location, histology and dysplasia) from corresponding pathology reports. Pathology and endoscopy data were merged by polyp location using a four-stage algorithm. NLP and merging procedures were validated by manual review of 500 pathology reports. Results 305,656 colonoscopies in 213,924 patients were identified. After merging, 76,137 patients had matched polyp data for 334,750 polyps.

Aim The aim of this study was to describe the landscape of technology-enhanced approaches that could be used to facilitate medical chart review within and across distributed data networks. Method We conducted a semi-structured survey regarding processes for medical chart review with organizations that either routinely do medical chart review or use technologies that could facilitate chart review. Results Fifteen out of 17 interviewed organizations used optical character recognition (OCR) or natural language processing (NLP) in their chart review process. None used handwriting recognition software. While these organizations found OCR and NLP to be useful for expediting extraction of useful information from medical charts, they also mentioned several challenges. Quality of medical scans can be variable, interfering with the accuracy of OCR. Additionally, linguistic complexity in medical notes and heterogeneity in reporting templates used by different healthcare systems can reduce the transportability of NLP-based algorithms to diverse healthcare settings. Conclusion New technologies including OCR and NLP are currently in use by various organizations involved in medical chart review. While technology-enhanced approaches could scale up capacity to validate key variables and make information about important clinical variables from medical records more generally available for research purposes, they often require considerable customization when employed in a distributed data environment with multiple, diverse healthcare settings.",0,0,HEALTH; VALIDATION; ALGORITHM; VALIDITY; DATABASE; FOOD; TEXT,Review,2
Dilated convolution for enhanced extractive summarization: A GAN-based approach with BERT word embedding,"Wu, Huimin; IOS PRESS; Wu, Huimin; Wu, Huimin",2024,JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & FUZZY SYSTEMS,10.3233/JIFS-234709,WOS:001193319500108,Peoples R China,"Text summarization (TS) plays a crucial role in natural language processing (NLP) by automatically condensing and capturing key information from text documents. Its significance extends to diverse fields, including engineering, healthcare, and others, where it offers substantial time and resource savings. However, manual summarization is a laborious task, prompting the need for automated text summarization systems. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for extractive summarization that leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) word embedding. BERT, a transformer-based architecture, processes sentence bidirectionally, considering both preceding and following words. This contextual understanding empowers BERT to generate word representations that carry a deeper meaning and accurately reflect their usage within specific contexts. Our method adopts a generator and discriminator within the GAN framework. The generator assesses the likelihood of each sentence in the summary while the discriminator evaluates the generated summary. To extract meaningful features in parallel, we introduce three dilated convolution layers in the generator and discriminator. Dilated convolution allows for capturing a larger context and incorporating long-range dependencies. By introducing gaps between filter weights, dilated convolution expands the receptive field, enabling the model to consider a broader context of words. To encourage the generator to explore diverse sentence combinations that lead to high-quality summaries, we introduce various noises to each document within our proposed GAN. This approach allows the generator to learn from a range of sentence permutations and select the most suitable ones. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model using the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. The results, measured using the ROUGE metric, demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to other tested methods. This confirms the effectiveness of our GAN-based strategy, which integrates dilated convolution layers, BERT word embedding, and a generator-discriminator framework in achieving enhanced extractive summarization performance.",0,0,Automated extractive summarization; generative adversarial network; bidirectional encoder representations from; transformers; dilated convolution layer; NETWORKS,Article,4

Several definitions for each have been proposed in the literature. Objective To assess the impact of remission/LDA according to various definitions on relevant outcomes in patients with SLE. Methods This systematic literature review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses using PubMed (1946-week 2, April 2021), Cochrane library (1985-week 2, week 2, April 2021) and EMBASE (1974-week 2, April 2021). We included longitudinal and cross-sectional studies in patients with SLE reporting the impact of remission and LDA (regardless their definition) on mortality, damage accrual, flares, health-related quality of life and other outcomes (cardiovascular risk, hospitalisation and direct costs). The quality of evidence was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results We identified 7497 articles; of them, 31 studies met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Some articles reported a positive association with survival, although this was not confirmed in all of them. Organ damage accrual was the most frequently reported outcome, and remission and LDA were reported as protective of this outcome (risk measures varying from 0.04 to 0.95 depending on the definition). Similarly, both states were associated with a lower probability of SLE flares, hospitalisations and a better health-related quality of life, in particular the physical domain. Conclusion Remission and LDA are associated with improvement in multiple outcomes in patients with SLE, thus reinforcing their relevance in clinical practice.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an effective representation for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Deep learning strategies, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), require an enormous amount of data to generalize the target disease. Given the restrictions on collecting data, augmentation methods are important tools for increasing the number of samples available for training a CNN. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been employed to generate synthetic medical data such as sMRI. In this paper, we propose a conditional progressive GAN (cProGAN) for data augmentation. The proposed cProGAN utilizes additive noise, which is regulated by the feedback from the discriminator that is trained by labeled data. The synthetic samples generated by using cProGAN go through a sample selection process regulated by the distributions of the original data mapped into the linear discriminator analysis (LDA) space. Three-class labeled data are mapped into LDA space where each class is modeled within an elliptic confidence subspace. Generated synthetic data that falls into these class subspaces are selected as the synthetic data to be used for training the CNN. This strategy helps select the most relevant samples with the desired class. Evidently, based on the experimental results, the suggested cProGAN creates synthetic data with higher quality than other state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, class-specific LDA subspace post-processing helps the selection of class-separated augmented data for improved classification performance.",0,0,Alzheimer's disease; Generative adversarial networks; LDA; Deep learning; Classification; PREDICTION; CONVERSION; DIAGNOSIS,Article,3

Recent findings Over 10 years ago, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the World Health Organization, and the United States Preventive Service Task Force began publishing guidelines focused on the use of LDA in pregnancy. Since the release of these guidelines, several large studies have re-evaluated the use of LDA with a focus on initiation of treatment and dosing. The combined results of these studies suggest a decreased rate of preeclampsia at aspirin doses >100 mg when treatment is initiated prior to 16 weeks of gestation. Overall, early initiation of LDA has been shown to decrease the development of preeclampsia in patients considered at increased risk. Current literature suggests increasing the recommended dose to >100 mg to optimize these risk reductions. Although LDA use seems promising for other outcomes like preterm delivery and intrauterine growth restriction, further studies to strengthen recommendations are warranted.",0,0,aspirin; high-risk pregnancy; intrauterine growth restriction; preeclampsia; preterm delivery; PRETERM; PREECLAMPSIA; PREVENTION; PLACEBO; WOMEN; RISK,Review,1
Why do people (not) like me?: Mining opinion influencing factors from reviews,"Bilici, Eda; Saygin, Yucel; PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD; Bilici, Eda; Saygin, Yucel; Bilici, Eda",2017,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,10.1016/j.eswa.2016.10.001,WOS:000388777700017,England; Turkey,"Feedback, without doubt, is a very important mechanism for companies or political parties to re-evaluate and improve their processes or policies. In this paper, we propose opinion influencing factors (OIFs) as a means to provide feedback about what influences the opinions of people. We also describe a methodology to mine OIFs from textual documents with the intention to bring a new perspective to the existing recommendation systems by concentrating on service providers (or policy makers) rather than customers. This new perspective enables one to discover the reasons why people like or do not like something by learning relationships among the traits/products via semantic rules and the factors that lead to change on the opinions such as from positive to negative. As a case study we target the healthcare domain, and experiment with the patients' reviews on doctors. Experimental results show the gist of thousands of comments on particular aspects (also called as factors) associated with semantic rules in an effective way. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the health- and medical-service areas, IT supports Internet of things (IoT)-based medical services and health-care systems for patients. Medical facilities have been advanced on the basis of such IoT devices, and the digitized information on human behaviors and health makes the delivery of efficient and convenient health care possible. Under the given circumstances, health and medical care have been researched. For some of this research, the patient-health data were collected using IoT-based medical devices, and they served as a tool for medical diagnosis and treatment. This study proposes the development of a medical big-data mining process for which topic modeling is employed. The proposed method uses the big data that are offered by the open system of the health- and medical-services big data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, and their application follows the guidelines of the knowledge discovery in big-data process for data mining and topic modeling. For the medical data regarding the topic modeling, the public structured health- and medical-services big data, Open API, and patient datasets were used. For the document classification in the semantic situation of a topic, the Bag of Words technique and the latent Dirichlet allocation method were applied to find the document association for the development of the medical big-data mining process. In addition, this study conducted a performance evaluation of the topic-modeling accuracy based on the medical big-data mining process and the topic-modeling efficiency, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was examined.",0,0,IT convergence; Big-data analysis; Data mining; Topic modeling; Medical data; Healthcare; INDEX SERVICE; MOBILE SERVICE,Article,4

A systematic review. Objective. The aim of this study was to determine the association between study outcomes and the presence of a conflict of interest (COI) in the lumbar disc arthroplasty (LDA) literature. Summary of Background Data. Previous studies have evaluated the efficacy of LDA as a surgical alternative to arthrodesis. As investigators may have financial relationships with LDA device companies, it is important to consider the role of COI on study outcomes. Methods. A systematic review was performed to identify articles reporting clinical outcomes of LDA. Any financial COIs disclosed were recorded and confirmed through Open Payments and ProPublica databases. Study outcomes were graded as favorable, unfavorable, or equivocal. Pearson Chi-squared analysis was used to determine an association between COI and study outcomes. Favorable outcomes were tested for an association with study characteristics using Poisson regression with robust error variance. Results. Fifty-seven articles were included, 30 had a financial COI, while 27 did not. Ninety percent of the conflicted studies disclosed their COI in the article. Studies with United States authors were more likely to be conflicted (P = 0.019). A majority of studies reported favorable outcomes for LDA (n = 39). Conflicted studies were more likely to report favorable outcomes than nonconflicted studies (P = 0.020). Articles with COIs related to consultant fees (P = 0.003), research funding (P = 0.002), and stock ownership (P < 0.001) were more likely to report favorable outcomes. Conclusion. This study highlights the importance for authors to accurately report conflicting relationships with industry. As such, orthopedic surgeons should critically evaluate study outcomes with regard to potential conflicts before recommending LDA as a surgical option to their patients.",0,0,COI; conflict of interest; consultant fees; financial relationship; LDA; lumbar disc arthroplasty; outcomes; research funding; stock ownership; systematic review; INTEREST DISCLOSURES; REPLACEMENT SURGERY; INDUSTRY; DISEASE; MEDICINE; FUSION,Review,1

Methods In total, 239 infant patients undergoing both thorax CTA and echocardiography were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were assigned to either mild or severe CoA group based on their pressure gradient on echocardiography. They were further divided into patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and non-PDA groups. The anatomical features were measured on double-oblique multiplanar reconstructed CTA images. Then, the optimal features were identified by using the Boruta algorithm. Subsequently, the coarctation severity was classified using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We further investigated the relationship between the anatomical features and re-coarctation using Cox regression. Results Four anatomical features showed significant differences between the mild and severe CoA groups, including the smallest aortic cross-sectional area indexed to body surface area (p < 0.001), the narrowest aortic diameter (CoA diameter) indexed to height (p < 0.001), the diameter of the descending aorta at the diaphragmatic level (p < 0.001) and weight (p = 0.005). With these features, accuracy of 88.6% and 90.2%, sensitivity of 65.0% and 72.1%, and specificity of 92.9% and 100% were obtained for classifying the CoA severity in the non-PDA and PDA groups, respectively. Moreover, CoA diameter indexed to weight was associated with the risk of re-coarctation. Conclusions CoA severity can be evaluated by using LDA with anatomical features. When quantifying the severity of CoA and risk of re-coarctation, both anatomical alternations at the CoA site and the growth of the patients need to be considered.",0,0,Aortic coarctation; Computed tomography angiography; Risk assessment; Re-coarctation; Machine learning; HEMODYNAMIC SEVERITY; CHILDREN; REPAIR; RISK; ANGIOGRAPHY; PREDICTION; DIAGNOSIS; ADULTS; MODEL,Article,2

However, despite numerous benefits, it presents several critical issues. Objectives: to collect the opinions of a group of researchers from the epidemiological scientific community on peer -review processes. Design: cross-sectional study using a questionnaire evaluation. Setting and participants: a 29 -question survey was administered to 516 healthcare professionals through the SurveyMonkey platform. The questions focused on the individual characteristics of the respondents and their perceived satisfaction with some characteristics of the review process as well as their propensity of changing some aspects of it. In addition, three open-ended questions were included, allowing respondents to provide comments on the role that reviewers and the review process should play. Descriptive statistics were produced in terms of absolute frequencies and percentages for the information collected through the questionnaire. Secondly, a multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the willingness to change certain aspects of peer review, adjusting for covariates such as age, sex, being the author of at least one scientific work, being a reviewer of at least one scientific work, and belonging to a specific discipline. The results are expressed as odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Text analysis and representation using word cloud were also used for an open-ended question. Main outcomes measures: level of satisfaction regarding some characteristics of the peer -review process. Results: a total of 516 participants completed the questionnaire. Specifically, 87.2% (N. 450) of the participants were the authors of at least one scientific publication, 78.7% were first authors at least once (N. 406), and 71.5% acted as reviewers within the peer -review process (N. 369). The results obtained from the multiple logistic regression models did not highlight any significant differences in terms of propensity to change for age and sex categories, except for a lower propensity of the under 35 age group towards unmasking, defined as the presence of reviewers and editorial boards names on the publish article (OR <35 years vs 45-54 years: 0.51; 95%CI 0.29-0.89) and a higher propensity for post -for - matting proposals, defined as the possibility of formatting the article following journal guidelines after the acceptance, among those under 45 (OR <35 years vs 45-54 years: 1.73; 95%CI 0.90-3.31; OR 35-44 years vs 45-54 years: 2.02; 95%CI 1.10-3.72). Finally, approximately 50% of respondents found it appropriate to receive credits for the revision work performed, while approximately 30% found it appropriate to receive a discount on publication fees for the same journal in which they acted as reviewers.

The proposed MDEFC method incorporates an asymptotic termination rule and a new differential weight for enhancing the termination condition and improving this method's ability in exploring the solution space of the objective function. The extensive empirical analysis states that the proposed MDEFC method achieved impressive recognition results with minimal training time by using both spatial and temporal features of the individual. The proposed MDEFC method's effectiveness is tested on a real time dataset and an online Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) v1.1 dataset. The result findings demonstrate that the proposed MDEFC method averagely obtained 99.73 % of precision and 99.86 % of recall on the WISDM v1.1 dataset. Similarly, the proposed MDEFC method averagely obtained 93.46 % of f1-measure, 94.60 % of recall, and 93.88 % of precision on the real time dataset. These obtained experimental results are significantly higher in comparison to the traditional HAR methods.",0,0,Differential evolution; Fuzzy clustering; Human activity recognition; Human computer interaction; Internet of things; Z-score technique; MODEL; NETWORK,Article,1

Although medics and health professionals are the final decision makers, the advice and recommendations obtained from fellow patients are significant. In this context, the present paper explores the topics of discussion posted by breast cancer patients and survivors on online forums. The study examines an online forum, Breastcancer.org, maps the discussion entries to several topics, and proposes a machine learning model based on a classification algorithm to characterize the topics. To explore the topics of breast cancer patients and survivors, approximately 1000 posts are selected and manually labeled with annotations. In contrast, millions of posts are available to build the labels. A semi-supervised learning technique is used to build the labels for the unlabeled data; hence, the large data are classified using a deep learning algorithm. The deep learning algorithm BiLSTM with BERT word embedding technique provided a better f1-score of 79.5%. This method is able to classify the following topics: medication reviews, clinician knowledge, various treatment options, seeking and providing support, diagnostic procedures, financial issues and implications for everyday life. What matters the most for the patients is coping with everyday living as well as seeking and providing emotional and informational support. The approach and findings show the potential of studying social media to provide insight into patients' experiences with cancer like critical health problems.",4,0,Social media; Machine learning; Deep learning; Natural language processing; Breast cancer; COMMUNITY; INFORMATION,Article,6
Dynamics of relevance judgment during physicians' online information search process for patient treatment,"Kim, Soon; Chung, EunKyung; Kwon, Nahyun; UNIV MALAYA, FAC COMPUTER SCIENCE & INFORMATION TECH; Kim, Soon; Chung, EunKyung; Kwon, Nahyun; Chung, EunKyung; Chung, EunKyung; Kim, Soon",2021,MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF LIBRARY & INFORMATION SCIENCE,10.22452/mjlis.vol26no1.2,WOS:000648776900002,South Korea,"Physicians rely on online sources of information more so than ever, to find the information they need when treating patients, but little is known about determining the relevance criteria when searching for online sources. Relevance judgment criteria can change with a user's background knowledge on a search topic. Physicians are a subset of users who have received insufficient attention in this relevance criteria research topic. Due to the dynamic and multidimensional nature of relevance judgments, it is important to understand how relevance judgment criteria change in the course of information search. This study aims to determine the dynamics in relevance judgment criteria in physicians' information search process. We observed ten internal medicine physicians while they searched the online clinical information resource to resolve a clinical question concerning patient treatment. They rated on a checklist to assess relevance judgment criteria at each of the three stages in the search process, namely, problem recognition (before searching), system interaction (searching for online resources), and document interaction (selecting the final documents after searching). We conducted pre-interview and post-interview to probe physicians search behaviours and reasons for the assessments. Topical relevance, accuracy, and credibility were found to he the most important criteria for all three search stages; however, ratings of some relevance judgment criteria, such as title, obtainability, personal preference, and understandability, changed markedly across the search process. The criteria regarding the information content tended to be more important during the problem recognition stage, while the criteria in the information format became more important as the search progressed. Physicians preferred recently published review articles in highly reliable journals with well-written article outlines, which allowed them to have quick and clear understanding of the contents. By identifying specific relevance criteria prominent at each search stage, our study revealed that physicians employ a unique set of criteria when judging the relevance. Given the fact that physicians are relying on online resources to find answers to patient care, this study can help in developing the effective clinical information systems for physicians and integrating into the Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems.",0,0,Information search process; Online information search; Information seeking behaviour; Dynamics of relevance judgment; Online clinical information systems; RESEARCH-PROJECT; PUBMED DATABASE; COGNITIVE MODEL; USERS CRITERIA; DOCUMENT USE; CARE; PERSPECTIVES; BEHAVIOR; SEEKING; DOCTORS,Article,0

With an increase in the demand for healthcare and rising costs related to chronic care, physicians need to be better trained to address chronic disease at various stages of illness in a collaborative and cost-effective manner. Specific and measurable learning objectives are key to the design and evaluation of effective training, but there has been no consensus on chronic disease learning objectives appropriate to medical student education. Approach: Wagner's Chronic Care Model (CCM) was selected as a theoretical framework to guide development of an enhanced chronic disease prevention and management (CDPM) curriculum. Findings of a literature review of CDPM competencies, objectives, and topical statements were mapped to each of the six domains of the CCM to understand the breadth of existing learning topics within each domain. At an in-person meeting, medical educators prepared a survey for the modified Delphi approach. Attendees identified 51 possible learning objectives from the literature review mapping, rephrased the CCM domains as competencies, constructed possible CDPM learning objectives for each competency with the goal of reaching multi-institutional consensus on a limited number of CDPM learning objectives that would be feasible for institutions to use to guide enhancement of medical student curricula related to CDPM. After the meeting, the group developed a survey which included 39 learning objectives. In the study phase of the modified Delphi approach, 32 physician CDPM experts and educators completed an online survey to prioritize the top 20 objectives. The next step occurred at a CDPM interest group in-person meeting with the goal of identifying the top 10 objectives. Findings: The CCM domains were reframed as the following competencies for medical student education: patient self-care management, decision support, clinical information systems, community resources, delivery systems and teams, and health system practice and improvement. Eleven CDPM learning objectives were identified within the six competencies that were most important in developing curriculum for medical students. Insights: These learning objectives cut across education on the prevention and management of individual chronic diseases and frame chronic disease care as requiring the health system science competencies identified in the CCM. They are intended to be used in combination with traditional disease-specific pathophysiology and treatment objectives. Additional efforts are needed to identify specific curricular strategies and assessment tools for each learning objective.",0,0,Undergraduate medical education; chronic care; prevention; health systems science; modified Delphi; CHRONIC-CARE MODEL; STUDENTS ATTITUDES; CHRONIC ILLNESS; INTERVENTIONS,Article,0

Therefore, this review aimed to systematically review previous studies on the topic and summarize the prevalence of PMDD among students in Ethiopia and formulate recommendations for future clinical services. The preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were used to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis. Popular databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Psych-INFO, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, African Index Medicus, and African Journals Online (AJOL) were searched for relevant studies. We used a Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software version 3.0 (CMA-3.0) to conduct a meta-analysis. The random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. The magnitude of statistical heterogeneity between the eligible articles was checked by Cochrane Q and the I-2 statistics. The funnel plot and Egger's regression tests were used to assess potential publication bias. A total of 12 studies that were published between 2003 and 2019 was included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled estimated prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder among female students in Ethiopia was 54.5% (95% CI 40.8-67.6). The pooled estimated prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder was approximately similar for both studies that recruited study participants from either high school or higher education. Further, the pooled estimated prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder was ranging from 51.2 to 57.2% in leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, suggesting that the removal of one study did not affect the overall prevalence estimate.

Use of intraperitoneal local anaesthetic for laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be a way of reducing pain. A previous version of this Cochrane Review found very low-certainty evidence on the benefits and harms of the intervention. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of intraperitoneal instillation of local anaesthetic agents in people undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLIN E, Embase, and three other databases to 19 January 2021 together with reference checking of studies retrieved. We also searched five online clinical trials registries to identify unpublished or ongoing trials to 10 Septem ber 2021. We contacted study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We only considered randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, publication status, or relevance of outcome measure) comparing local anaesthetic intraperitoneal instillation versus placebo, no intervention, or inactive control during laparoscopic cholecystectomy, for the review. We excluded non -randomised studies, and studies where the method of allocating participants to a treatment was not strictly random (e.g. date of birth, hospital record number, or alternation). Data collection and analysis Two review authors collected the data independently. Primary outcomes included all -cause mortality, serious adverse events, and quality of life. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, pain, return to activity and work, and non -serious adverse events. The analysis included both fixed -effect and random -effects models using RevManWeb. We performed subgroup, sensitivity, and meta -regression analyses. For each outcome, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (Cls). We assessed risk of bias using predefined domains, graded the certainty of the evidence using GRADE, and presented outcome results in a summary of findings table. Main results Eighty-five completed trials were included, of which 76 trials contributed data to one or more of the outcomes. This included a total of 4957 participants randomised to intraperitoneal local anaesthetic instillation (2803 participants) and control (2154 participants). Most trials only included participants undergoing elective la paroscopic cholecystectomy and those who were at low anaesthetic risk (ASA I and II). The most commonly used local anaesthetic agent was bupivacaine. Methods of instilling the local anaesthetic varied considerably between trials; this included location and timing of application. The control groups received 0.9% normal saline (69 trials), no intervention (six trials), or sterile water (two trials). One trial did not specify the control agent used. None of the trials provided information on follow-up beyond point of discharge from hospital. Only two trials were at low risk of bias. Seven trials received external funding, of these three were assessed to be at risk of conflicts of interest, a further 17 trials declared no funding. We are very uncertain about the effect intraperitoneal local anaesthetic versus control on mortality; zero mortalities in either group (8 trials; 446 participants; very low -certainty evidence); serious adverse events (RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.34); 13 trials; 988 participants; discharge on same day of surgery (RR 1.43; 95% CI 0.64 to 3.",0,0,Ambulatory Surgical Procedures [statistics & numerical data]; Anesthesia; Local [methods]; Anesthetics; Local radministration &; dosage]; Bupivacaine [administration & dosage]; Cholecystectomy; Laparoscopic [ adverse effects] [methods]; Gallstones [surgery]; Length of Stay [statistics & numerical data]; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Humans; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN RELIEF; TRIAL SEQUENTIAL-ANALYSIS; COMBINED PREINCISIONAL INFILTRATION; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; DOUBLE-BLIND; ROPIVACAINE INSTILLATION; PREEMPTIVE ANALGESIA; GALLBLADDER BED; BUPIVACAINE INSTILLATION; DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS,Review,0

Adequate care can be insufficient due to language barriers, cultural differences, and knowledge deficits of health service providers. Therefore, professional associations requested that healthcare providers to be educated to provide culturally sensitive care. An evidence-based educational intervention in the form of a continuing interprofessional education (CIPE) for healthcare providers on the topic of PTSD in migrants and refugees was developed, pilot-implemented, and evaluated according to the first two levels of the Kirkpatrick evaluation model (reaction and learning). Methods The development of a curriculum for the CIPE intervention was based on a narrative literature review. Its content was validated by experts (N = 17) in an online survey and analyzed using both the Content Validity Index and a thematic analysis. The evaluation of the CIPE intervention was performed by conducting a pilot study with a quasi-experimental single group, using a pre-posttest design. In total, there were 39 participants distributed among three pilot courses. We collected and analyzed data on satisfaction, knowledge, and feasibility. Results The curriculum for a half-day course, consisting of 8 modules, showed almost excellent content validity (S-CVI = 0.92). In the pilot-implementation phase, participants were ""very satisfied"" with the pilot courses and a positive effect on their knowledge was detected. No correlation between satisfaction and knowledge gain was found. Conclusions The CIPE intervention can be considered feasible and seems promising in its effects on satisfaction and knowledge. The insights gained in this study can be used to adapt and optimize the educational intervention, whereby the feedback from course attendees is particularly useful.

Yet, a higher-level integration of the evidence is still lacking. This study aimed to synthesize existing systematic literature reviews published on this topic, offering an overview that can help policymakers and public health authorities to select appropriate policies and guidelines. Methods: We conducted an umbrella review: a review of systematic reviews published between 2011 and 2023 following the PRISMA statement guidelines. The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021254568). As part of the search strategy, three database searches were conducted, specifically in PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The quality of the included reviews was determined using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2. Results: Synthesis included 32 systematic reviews and 3,704 primary studies that investigated how the social media listening could improve the healthcare system's efficiency in terms of a timely response to treat epidemic situations. Most of the included systematic reviews concluded showing positive outcomes when using social media data for infectious disease surveillance. Conclusion: Systematic reviews showed the important role of social media in predicting and detecting disease outbreaks, potentially reducing morbidity and mortality through swift public health action. The policy interventions strongly benefit from the continued use of online data in public health surveillance systems because they can help in recognizing important patterns for disease surveillance and significantly improve the disease prediction abilities of the traditional surveillance systems.",0,0,health policy; emerging infectious diseases; umbrella review; social media; surveillance; SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; SURVEILLANCE; TWITTER,Review,0

The diagnosis of a chronic disease in a child can affect the quality of life of all family members, including siblings. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of quality of life among siblings aged 8 to 12 years who have a brother or sister with chronic diseases. Methods: In this case-control study conducted in Rasht, 85 siblings of children with chronic diseases as the case group and 172 siblings of healthy children as the control group were recruited using cluster sampling. The two groups were matched for age and gender. Data were collected using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL TM) and a demographic questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and logistic regression analysis tests via SPSS version 16. Results: The mean quality of life scores in the case and control groups were 88.86 +/- 10.33 and 87.39 +/- 10.89, respectively, indicating a desirable level within both groups. No statistically significant difference was found in this regard between the two groups. Based on the logistic regression analysis, three variables of number of family members (P = 0.03), mother's education level (P = 0.025), and family's income level (P = 0.023) were identified as significant predictors of quality of life. In this regard, it was found that the number of family members and the mother's education level were positively related to the quality of life, increasing the mean scores by 2.32 and 1.48, respectively. Conversely, a higher family income level was associated with a decrease in quality of life scores by 0.543. Conclusions: The study found that the quality of life among siblings of children with chronic diseases is good, comparable to that of their peers. The findings imply that the chronicity of the disease does not significantly impair siblings' adaptation and overall well-being. Practice implications: The findings of this study can be used in various fields, including healthcare management, nursing clinical services, nursing education, and nursing research.

Healthcare providers working with patients in the continuum of cancer care play essential roles in identifying and addressing mobility impairments. The objective of this article is to present common assistive devices valuable in managing cancer and cancer treatment-related mobility impairments. Methods: Peer-reviewed scientific publications and expert opinions. Results: This article highlights assistive devices commonly used in various settings of cancer care and describes how they address different impairments faced by cancer survivors. The information presented can potentially serve as a resource when training clinical staff (eg, oncology nursing staff) on device provision across all settings. The information can also be useful for patients and caregivers to learn about potential functional impairments linked to cancer and treatments and assistive devices that can be useful to improve patients' functional capacity and reduce caregiver burden. Conclusion: It is essential to involve different team members to identify and select the most appropriate assistive devices that match the patient's functional needs and physical capacity and to train them in device use so they can safely carry out their daily routine. Implications for Nursing Practice: Oncology nurses are one of the first providers to identify mobility impairments in cancer patients. This article will help increase their knowledge in common assistive devices valuable for addressing various mobility impairments associated with cancer and treatments. With additional training on device provision, oncology nurses will be more empowered to collaborate with rehabilitation to identify potential mobility impairments, initiate device provision, and encourage their patients to work with therapy services. Ultimately this could reduce injuries linked to mobility impairments and improve the patient's functional independence and overall quality of life. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: A retrospective review of 965 ethics consultation notes to identify patients aged 18-26 years cared for in the pediatric or adult setting between January 1, 2016-December 31, 2020. We collected demographic information and used conceptual content analysis to identify the primary ethical issue and contextual features for each consult and analyzed these using descriptive statistics. Results: We identified 46 consults (30 adult and 16 pediatric) for 40 unique patients (28 adult and 12 pediatric). The median age was 19 years in the pediatric setting and 24 in the adult setting. Fifty-three percent were female, 95% non-Hispanic, 68% White, and 76% were inpatient. The primary ethical issue in the adult setting was Refusal of Recommended Treatment (20%), while the dominant contextual issue was Communication Disputes/Conflicts Between the Staff and Patient (23%). The primary ethical issue for the pediatric setting was Goals of Care (31%) and the dominant contextual feature was concerns for Quality of Life (31%). Discussion: The primary ethical issues and related contextual features this population experiences differ based on setting. Improved understanding of adolescent and young adult development, especially related to values formation, decision-making, and communication skills training may ameliorate some of these challenges. Referral patterns for this age group overall and particularly for patients on the ends of the spectrum and inpatients raise concerns for ethics consultation use.

In terms of gaining insights from unstructured medical based texts, sentiment prediction is becoming an increasingly crucial machine learning technique. In fact, due to its robustness and accuracy, it recently gained popularity in the medical industries. Medical text mining is well known as a fundamental data analytic for sentiment prediction. To form a high-dimensional sparse matrix, a popular preprocessing step in text mining is employed to transform medical text strings to word vectors. However, such a sparse matrix poses problems to the induction of accurate sentiment prediction model. The swarm search in our proposed OS-FS can be optimized by a new feature evaluation technique called clustering-by-coefficient-of-variation. In order to find a subset of features from all the original features from the sparse matrix, this type of feature selection has been a commonly utilized dimensionality reduction technique, and has the capability to improve accuracy of the prediction model. We implement this method based on a case scenario where 279 medical articles related to meaningful use functionalities on health care quality, safety, and efficiency' from a systematic review of previous medical IT literature. For this medical text mining, a multi-class of sentiments, positive, mixed-positive, neutral and negative is recognized from the document contents. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of OS-FS over traditional feature selection methods in literature.",0,0,Medical text mining; Optimized swarm search-based feature selection; Sentiment prediction; Clustering-by-coefficient-of-variation,Article,3

Understanding user experiences of these novel structures can help optimize their design and increase patient satisfaction and vaccine uptake. This study drew on user online reviews of vaccination centers to assess user experience and identify its key determinants over time, by sentiment, and by interaction. Machine learning methods were used to analyze Google reviews of six COVID-19 mass vaccination centers in Berlin from December 2020 to December 2021. 3647 user online reviews were included in the analysis. Of these, 89% (3261/3647) were positive according to user rating (four to five of five stars). A total of 85% (2740/3647) of all reviews contained text. Topic modeling of the reviews containing text identified five optimally latent topics, and keyword extraction identified 47 salient keywords. The most important themes were organization, friendliness/responsiveness, and patient flow/wait time. Key interactions for users of vaccination centers included waiting, scheduling, transit, and the vaccination itself. Keywords connected to scheduling and efficiency, such as ""appointment"" and ""wait"", were most prominent in negative reviews. Over time, the average rating score decreased from 4.7 to 4.1, and waiting and duration became more salient keywords. Overall, mass vaccination centers appear to be positively perceived, yet users became more critical over the one-year period of the pandemic vaccination campaign observed. The study shows that online reviews can provide real-time insights into newly set-up infrastructures, and policymakers should consider their use to monitor the population's response over time.",0,0,mass vaccination centers; national vaccination campaign; vaccine uptake; patient satisfaction; patient experience; health services design; pandemic response; online reviews; natural language processing; machine learning; text mining; topic modeling; keyword extraction; SOCIAL MEDIA; VACCINES; HEALTH; CARE,Article,7

Experiences are mainly collected using closed-ended questions, although the value of open-ended questions is widely recognized. Natural language processing (NLP) can automate the analysis of open-ended questions for an efficient approach to patient-centeredness. Methods We developed the Artificial Intelligence Patient-Reported Experience Measures (AI-PREM) tool, consisting of a new, open-ended questionnaire, an NLP pipeline to analyze the answers using sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and a visualization to guide physicians through the results. The questionnaire and NLP pipeline were iteratively developed and validated in a clinical context. Results The final AI-PREM consisted of five open-ended questions about the provided information, personal approach, collaboration between healthcare professionals, organization of care, and other experiences. The AI-PREM was sent to 867 vestibular schwannoma patients, 534 of which responded. The sentiment analysis model attained an F1 score of 0.97 for positive texts and 0.63 for negative texts. There was a 90% overlap between automatically and manually extracted topics. The visualization was hierarchically structured into three stages: the sentiment per question, the topics per sentiment and question, and the original patient responses per topic. Conclusions The AI-PREM tool is a comprehensive method that combines a validated, open-ended questionnaire with a well-performing NLP pipeline and visualization.

The challenge associated with reduced verbal output among many persons with aphasia (PWA) has reportedly been a key reason measures of treatment satisfaction have been limited. A novel approach to measure treatment satisfaction is the use of content analysis (CA), which uses the presence of certain words, themes, or concepts to explore outcomes such as treatment satisfaction particularly among individuals who generate limited output. CA utilizes responses and response patterns to assign meaning to client responses. The aim of this study was to use CA to measure posttreatment satisfaction with a telepractice approach for aphasia treatment. Seventeen PWA received 12 treatment sessions over a 6-week period. At the conclusion of the treatment, CA was utilized to explore patient satisfaction with this treatment approach. The participants reported an overall positive sentiment for the telepractice approach.

Drawing on the two-factor theory, this paper aims to mine ODRs to explore the different determinants of patient satisfaction (PS) and patient dissatisfaction (PD) toward the United Kingdom healthcare services. This study collects reviews from a publicly available medical website Iwantgreatcare.org from January 2014 to December 2018, followed by the text mining method based on combining SentiNet and LDA to disclose the semantics of patients? healthcare experiences. The proposed method found latent topics across the high-risk and low-risk disease category that revealed new insights into what patients value when consulting a physician and what they dislike. For high-risk and low-risk diseases, the determinants of PS were more specific to the hospital business process (hospital environment, location, hospital cafeteria servicescape, parking availability, and medical process, etc.) and doctor-related aspects (physician knowledge, competence, and attitudes, etc.). In contrast, patients? concerns were most commonly related to their treatment experience and staff bedside manners for both disease categories. Finally, the classification results revealed that the proposed model, which analyzes patient opinion toward different aspects of care, outperformed other stateof-the-art models, with the highest classification F1-score of 88%. The study findings provide a clue for doctors, hospitals, and government officials to enhance PS and minimize PD by addressing their needs and improve the quality of care across different types of diseases, particularly in the current pandemic era of COVID-19.",0,0,Patient satisfaction; Patient dissatisfaction; Text mining; Topic modeling; LDA; Sentiment analysis; SERVICE QUALITY; CUSTOMER SATISFACTION; SENTIMENT; REVIEWS; CHINA; CARE; CONSUMERS; EMOTIONS,Article,7

Review data have become an essential reference point for supporting users in selecting doctors. As the research object, this study considered , a well-known e-consultation website in China.Methods: This study examines the topics and sentimental change rules of user review texts from a temporal perspective. We also compared the topics and sentimental change characteristics of user review texts before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. First, 323,519 review data points about 2,122 doctors on were crawled using Python from 2017 to 2022. Subsequently, we employed the latent Dirichlet allocation method to cluster topics and the ROST content mining software to analyze user sentiments. Second, according to the results of the perplexity calculation, we divided text data into five topics: diagnosis and treatment attitude, medical skills and ethics, treatment effect, treatment scheme, and treatment process. Finally, we identified the most important topics and their trends over time.Results: Users primarily focused on diagnosis and treatment attitude, with medical skills and ethics being the second-most important topic among users. As time progressed, the attention paid by users to diagnosis and treatment attitude increased-especially during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, when attention to diagnosis and treatment attitude increased significantly. User attention to the topic of medical skills and ethics began to decline during the COVID-19 outbreak, while attention to treatment effect and scheme generally showed a downward trend from 2017 to 2022. User attention to the treatment process exhibited a declining tendency before the COVID-19 outbreak, but increased after. Regarding sentiment analysis, most users exhibited a high degree of satisfaction for online medical services. However, positive user sentiments showed a downward trend over time, especially after the COVID-19 outbreak.Discussion: This study has reference value for assisting user choice regarding medical treatment, decision-making by doctors, and online medical platform design.",0,0,online medical platform; Haodf website; text mining; topic analysis; sentiment analysis; COVID-19 pandemics; HEALTH-CARE; PHYSICIAN; MODEL,Review,2

In pace with prior patients' photo-sharing on healthcare social media websites from personal computers and smartphones regarding their treatment experience, the amount of multi-modal content has been growing exponentially. Therefore, there is an increasing need for coping with such information to mine useful knowledge about the D-P communication. Scraping 68,610 reviews, including 4618 photos from a popular physician-rating site,, this study proposes a novel, real-time, multi-modal classification framework, which uses textual and visual modalities as a source of information. Furthermore, this work suggests a social media image filtering mechanism that filters duplicate and irrelevant information from the data. Results show that the data filtering enhances the information reliability, whereas the addition of novel text and visual feature sets improves the classification accuracy up to 16.94%. In addition, fusing textual and visual features enhance the performance of the classifier by 18.24%, which produces better results than considering them separately. The findings also revealed that deep learning algorithms outperformed the classical machine learning algorithms across the entire novel features model, indicating the usefulness and suitability of the proposed methodology.

In survivorship care, PROMs can be used to monitor health status and inform medical decision making. This article provides 10 important considerations for clinicians when they are assessing patient-reported outcomes for childhood cancer survivors. From choosing the right measure to selecting a strategy for clinical response, the purpose of these considerations is to support clinicians in implementing PROMs in their practice while keeping in mind some of the practical barriers and solutions of using PROMs with childhood cancer survivors. We end with an example of a framework for integrating PROMs into the clinical workflow that uses cutting-edge technologies (e.g., mHealth, natural language processing, and machine learning) to minimize interruptions to the clinical workflow and maximize the powerful utility of PROMs in cancer survivorship care. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are subjective assessments of health status or health-related quality of life. In childhood cancer survivors, PROMs can be used to evaluate the adverse effects of cancer treatment and guide cancer survivorship care. However, there are barriers to integrating PROMs into clinical practice, such as constraints in clinical validity, meaningful interpretation, and technology-enabled administration of the measures. This article discusses these barriers and proposes 10 important considerations for appropriate PROM integration into clinical care for choosing the right measure (considering the purpose of using a PROM, health profile vs. health preference approaches, measurement properties), ensuring survivors complete the PROMs (data collection method, data collection frequency, survivor capacity, self- vs. proxy reports), interpreting the results (scoring methods, clinical meaning and interpretability), and selecting a strategy for clinical response (integration into the clinical workflow). An example framework for integrating novel patient-reported outcome (PRO) data collection into the clinical workflow for childhood cancer survivorship care is also discussed. As we continuously improve the clinical validity of PROMs and address implementation barriers, routine PRO assessment and monitoring in pediatric cancer survivorship offer opportunities to facilitate clinical decision making and improve the quality of survivorship care.",0,0,childhood cancer survivors; patient-reported outcomes; health-related quality of life; implementation; symptoms; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; ADULT SURVIVORS; SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; PEDIATRIC CANCER; RESPONSE SHIFT; HEALTH-STATUS; PARENT-PROXY; ITEM BANKING; SELF-REPORT; CHILDREN,Review,2

Traditional patient-reported experience and outcomes measures (PREMs/PROMs) often fall short in addressing the complexities of these experiences due to subjectivity and their inability to precisely target the questions asked. In contrast, diary recordings offer a promising solution. They can provide a comprehensive picture of psychological well-being, encompassing both psychological and physiological symptoms. This study explores how using advanced digital technologies, i.e., automatic speech recognition and natural language processing, can efficiently capture patient insights in oncology settings. We introduce the MRAST framework, a simplified way to collect, structure, and understand patient data using questionnaires and diary recordings. The framework was validated in a prospective study with 81 colorectal and 85 breast cancer survivors, of whom 37 were male and 129 were female. Overall, the patients evaluated the solution as well made; they found it easy to use and integrate into their daily routine. The majority (75.3%) of the cancer survivors participating in the study were willing to engage in health monitoring activities using digital wearable devices daily for an extended period. Throughout the study, there was a noticeable increase in the number of participants who perceived the system as having excellent usability. Despite some negative feedback, 44.44% of patients still rated the app's usability as above satisfactory (i.e., 7.9 on 1-10 scale) and the experience with diary recording as above satisfactory (i.e., 7.0 on 1-10 scale). Overall, these findings also underscore the significance of user testing and continuous improvement in enhancing the usability and user acceptance of solutions like the MRAST framework. Overall, the automated extraction of information from diaries represents a pivotal step toward a more patient-centered approach, where healthcare decisions are based on real-world experiences and tailored to individual needs. The potential usefulness of such data is enormous, as it enables better measurement of everyday experiences and opens new avenues for patient-centered care.",0,0,multilingual framework; risk assessment; symptom tracking; chronic diseases; patient-centered care; real-world data; PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES; SELF-REPORT; HEALTH-CARE; ELECTRONIC DIARIES; CLINICAL-TRIALS; CENTERED CARE; QUESTIONNAIRES; INACCURACY; QUALITY,Article,2

Seven literature databases were searched with a query combining the concepts of natural language processing and structured data capture. Two reviewers screened all records for relevance during two screening phases, and information about clinical NLP systems was collected from the final set of papers. A total of 7149 records (after removing duplicates) were retrieved and screened, and 86 were determined to fit the review criteria. These papers contained information about 71 different clinical NLP systems, which were then analyzed. The NLP systems address a wide variety of important clinical and research tasks. Certain tasks are well addressed by the existing systems, while others remain as open challenges that only a small number of systems attempt, such as extraction of temporal information or normalization of concepts to standard terminologies. This review has identified many NLP systems capable of processing clinical free text and generating structured output, and the information collected and evaluated here will be important for prioritizing development of new approaches for clinical NLP.

Yet, there is paucity of evidence to support serious illness communication behaviors among clinicians. Herein, we propose three methodological innovations to advance the basic science of serious illness communication.Results: First, advanced computation techniques - e.g. machine-learning techniques and natural language processing - offer the possibility to measure the characteristics and complex patterns of audible serious illness communication in large datasets. Second, immersive technologies - e.g., virtual- and augmented reality - allow for experimentally manipulating and testing the effects of specific communication strategies, and interactional and environmental aspects of serious illness communication. Third, digital-health technologies - e.g., shared notes and videoconferences - can be used to unobtrusively observe and manipulate communication, and compare in-person to digitally-mediated communication elements and effects. Immersive and digital health technologies allow integration of physiological measurement (e.g. synchrony or gaze) that may advance our understanding of patient experience.
