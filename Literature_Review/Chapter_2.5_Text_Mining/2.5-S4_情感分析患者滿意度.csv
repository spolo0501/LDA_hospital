To do that, it constructs an online doctor selection decision-making method that considers the correlation attributes, in which the measure of attribute correlation is derived from the history real decision data. To combine public and personal preference with correlated attributes, it proposes a Choquet integral based comprehensive online doctor ranking method. In detail, a two stage classification model based on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is used to extract service features from unstructured text reviews. Then, 2-additive fuzzy measure is adopted to represent the patient public group aggregated attribute preference. Next, a novel optimization model is proposed to combine the public preference and personal preference. Finally, a case study of dxy.com is carried out to illustrate the procedure of the method. The comparison result between proposed method and other traditional MADM (multi-attribute decision-making) methods prove its rationality.",0,0,Multi-attribute decision-making; Doctor selection; Online reviews; Sentiment analysis; Choquet integral; 2-additive fuzzy measure; PATIENT COMPLAINTS; SERVICE QUALITY; CARE; MODEL; SYSTEMS,Article
Medical data mining in sentiment analysis based on optimized swarm search feature selection,"Zeng, Daohui; Peng, Jidong; Fong, Simon; Qiu, Yining; Wong, Raymond; SPRINGER; Zeng, Daohui; Peng, Jidong; Fong, Simon; Qiu, Yining; Wong, Raymond; Fong, Simon; Fong, Simon; Teng, Zhongzhao",2018,AUSTRALASIAN PHYSICAL & ENGINEERING SCIENCES IN MEDICINE,10.1007/s13246-018-0674-3,WOS:000451676000029,Peoples R China; Australia,"In this paper, we propose a novel technique termed as optimized swarm search-based feature selection (OS-FS), which is a swarm-type of searching function that selects an ideal subset of features for enhanced classification accuracy. In terms of gaining insights from unstructured medical based texts, sentiment prediction is becoming an increasingly crucial machine learning technique. In fact, due to its robustness and accuracy, it recently gained popularity in the medical industries. Medical text mining is well known as a fundamental data analytic for sentiment prediction. To form a high-dimensional sparse matrix, a popular preprocessing step in text mining is employed to transform medical text strings to word vectors. However, such a sparse matrix poses problems to the induction of accurate sentiment prediction model. The swarm search in our proposed OS-FS can be optimized by a new feature evaluation technique called clustering-by-coefficient-of-variation. In order to find a subset of features from all the original features from the sparse matrix, this type of feature selection has been a commonly utilized dimensionality reduction technique, and has the capability to improve accuracy of the prediction model. We implement this method based on a case scenario where 279 medical articles related to meaningful use functionalities on health care quality, safety, and efficiency' from a systematic review of previous medical IT literature. For this medical text mining, a multi-class of sentiments, positive, mixed-positive, neutral and negative is recognized from the document contents. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of OS-FS over traditional feature selection methods in literature.",0,0,Medical text mining; Optimized swarm search-based feature selection; Sentiment prediction; Clustering-by-coefficient-of-variation,Article

How Do Users Respond to Mass Vaccination Centers? A Cross-Sectional Study Using Natural Language Processing on Online Reviews to Explore User Experience and Satisfaction with COVID-19 Vaccination Centers,"Danek, Stella; Buettner, Martha; Krois, Joachim; Schwendicke, Falk; MDPI; Danek, Stella; Danek, Stella; Buttner, Martha; Büttner, Martha; Schwendicke, Falk",2023,VACCINES,10.3390/vaccines11010144,WOS:000915966100001,Germany,"To reach large groups of vaccine recipients, several high-income countries introduced mass vaccination centers for COVID-19. Understanding user experiences of these novel structures can help optimize their design and increase patient satisfaction and vaccine uptake. This study drew on user online reviews of vaccination centers to assess user experience and identify its key determinants over time, by sentiment, and by interaction. Machine learning methods were used to analyze Google reviews of six COVID-19 mass vaccination centers in Berlin from December 2020 to December 2021. 3647 user online reviews were included in the analysis. Of these, 89% (3261/3647) were positive according to user rating (four to five of five stars). A total of 85% (2740/3647) of all reviews contained text. Topic modeling of the reviews containing text identified five optimally latent topics, and keyword extraction identified 47 salient keywords. The most important themes were organization, friendliness/responsiveness, and patient flow/wait time. Key interactions for users of vaccination centers included waiting, scheduling, transit, and the vaccination itself. Keywords connected to scheduling and efficiency, such as ""appointment"" and ""wait"", were most prominent in negative reviews. Over time, the average rating score decreased from 4.7 to 4.1, and waiting and duration became more salient keywords. Overall, mass vaccination centers appear to be positively perceived, yet users became more critical over the one-year period of the pandemic vaccination campaign observed. The study shows that online reviews can provide real-time insights into newly set-up infrastructures, and policymakers should consider their use to monitor the population's response over time.",0,0,mass vaccination centers; national vaccination campaign; vaccine uptake; patient satisfaction; patient experience; health services design; pandemic response; online reviews; natural language processing; machine learning; text mining; topic modeling; keyword extraction; SOCIAL MEDIA; VACCINES; HEALTH; CARE,Article

Experiences are mainly collected using closed-ended questions, although the value of open-ended questions is widely recognized. Natural language processing (NLP) can automate the analysis of open-ended questions for an efficient approach to patient-centeredness. Methods We developed the Artificial Intelligence Patient-Reported Experience Measures (AI-PREM) tool, consisting of a new, open-ended questionnaire, an NLP pipeline to analyze the answers using sentiment analysis and topic modeling, and a visualization to guide physicians through the results. The questionnaire and NLP pipeline were iteratively developed and validated in a clinical context. Results The final AI-PREM consisted of five open-ended questions about the provided information, personal approach, collaboration between healthcare professionals, organization of care, and other experiences. The AI-PREM was sent to 867 vestibular schwannoma patients, 534 of which responded. The sentiment analysis model attained an F1 score of 0.97 for positive texts and 0.63 for negative texts. There was a 90% overlap between automatically and manually extracted topics. The visualization was hierarchically structured into three stages: the sentiment per question, the topics per sentiment and question, and the original patient responses per topic. Conclusions The AI-PREM tool is a comprehensive method that combines a validated, open-ended questionnaire with a well-performing NLP pipeline and visualization. Thematically organizing and quantifying patient feedback reduces the time invested by healthcare professionals to evaluate and prioritize patient experiences without being confined to the limited answer options of closed-ended questions.",0,0,Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis; Unsupervised machine learning; Patient satisfaction; Patient-centered care,Article

The challenge associated with reduced verbal output among many persons with aphasia (PWA) has reportedly been a key reason measures of treatment satisfaction have been limited. A novel approach to measure treatment satisfaction is the use of content analysis (CA), which uses the presence of certain words, themes, or concepts to explore outcomes such as treatment satisfaction particularly among individuals who generate limited output. CA utilizes responses and response patterns to assign meaning to client responses. The aim of this study was to use CA to measure posttreatment satisfaction with a telepractice approach for aphasia treatment. Seventeen PWA received 12 treatment sessions over a 6-week period. At the conclusion of the treatment, CA was utilized to explore patient satisfaction with this treatment approach. The participants reported an overall positive sentiment for the telepractice approach. Two primary topics emerged which were healthcare provider and healthcare delivery, where text analysis revealed discussion of these topics to be centered around being ""helpful"" and ""being effective.""

This study collects reviews from a publicly available medical website Iwantgreatcare.org from January 2014 to December 2018, followed by the text mining method based on combining SentiNet and LDA to disclose the semantics of patients? healthcare experiences. The proposed method found latent topics across the high-risk and low-risk disease category that revealed new insights into what patients value when consulting a physician and what they dislike. For high-risk and low-risk diseases, the determinants of PS were more specific to the hospital business process (hospital environment, location, hospital cafeteria servicescape, parking availability, and medical process, etc.) and doctor-related aspects (physician knowledge, competence, and attitudes, etc.). In contrast, patients? concerns were most commonly related to their treatment experience and staff bedside manners for both disease categories. Finally, the classification results revealed that the proposed model, which analyzes patient opinion toward different aspects of care, outperformed other stateof-the-art models, with the highest classification F1-score of 88%.
