EMR has been recognized as a valuable resource for large-scale analysis. However, EMR has the characteristics of diversity, incompleteness, redundancy, and privacy, which make it difficult to carry out data mining and analysis directly. Therefore, it is necessary to preprocess the source data in order to improve data quality and improve the data mining results. Different types of data require different processing technologies. Most structured data commonly needs classic preprocessing technologies, including data cleansing, data integration, data transformation, and data reduction. For semistructured or unstructured data, such as medical text, containing more health information, it requires more complex and challenging processing methods. The task of information extraction for medical texts mainly includes NER (named-entity recognition) and RE (relation extraction). This paper focuses on the process of EMR processing and emphatically analyzes the key techniques. In addition, we make an in-depth study on the applications developed based on text mining together with the open challenges and research issues for future work.",21,0,EXTRACTION; INFORMATION; ASSERTIONS; SYSTEM; RULE,Review

Nursing consultations vary widely across settings and countries, and their activities range from complementing to substituting traditional physician-led consultations or usual care. Objective: This study was aimed at describing the effects of nursing consultations with patients with complex conditions in any setting on patient outcomes (quality of life, physical status, psychosocial health, health behaviour, medication adherence, mortality, anthropometric and physiological outcomes, and patient satisfaction) and organisational outcomes (health resource use and costs). Design: Umbrella review. Methods: We followed the Joanna Briggs Institute method for umbrella reviews. We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published in English, Dutch, French, Spanish or German between January 2013 and February 2023. We included systematic literature reviews, with or without meta-analyses, that included randomised controlled trials conducted in high-income countries. Reviews were eligible if they pertained to consultations led by specialised nurses or advanced nurse practitioners. Article selection, data extraction and quality appraisal were performed independently by at least two reviewers. Results: We included 50 systematic reviews based on 473 unique trials. For all patient outcomes, nursing consultations achieved effects at least equivalent to those of physician-led consultations or usual care (i.e., non- inferiority). For quality of life, health behaviour, medication adherence, mortality and patient satisfaction, more than half the meta-analyses found statistically significant effects in favour of nursing consultations (i.e., superiority). Cost results must be interpreted with caution, because very few and heterogeneous cost-related data were extracted, and the methodological quality of the cost analyses was questionable. Narrative syntheses confirmed the overall conclusions of the meta-analyses. Conclusions: The effects of nursing consultations on patients with complex health conditions across healthcare settings appear to be at least similar to physician-led consultations or usual care. Nursing consultations appear to be more effective than physician-led consultations or usual care in terms of quality of life, health behaviour, mortality, patient satisfaction and medication adherence. Further analysis of the primary data is necessary to determine the patient populations and settings in which nursing consultations are most effective. Moderate study quality, diversity amongst and within systematic reviews, and quality of reporting hamper the strength of the findings. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

The diagnosis of a chronic disease in a child can affect the quality of life of all family members, including siblings. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the predictors of quality of life among siblings aged 8 to 12 years who have a brother or sister with chronic diseases. Methods: In this case-control study conducted in Rasht, 85 siblings of children with chronic diseases as the case group and 172 siblings of healthy children as the control group were recruited using cluster sampling. The two groups were matched for age and gender. Data were collected using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL TM) and a demographic questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, and logistic regression analysis tests via SPSS version 16. Results: The mean quality of life scores in the case and control groups were 88.86 +/- 10.33 and 87.39 +/- 10.89, respectively, indicating a desirable level within both groups. No statistically significant difference was found in this regard between the two groups. Based on the logistic regression analysis, three variables of number of family members (P = 0.03), mother's education level (P = 0.025), and family's income level (P = 0.023) were identified as significant predictors of quality of life. In this regard, it was found that the number of family members and the mother's education level were positively related to the quality of life, increasing the mean scores by 2.32 and 1.48, respectively. Conversely, a higher family income level was associated with a decrease in quality of life scores by 0.543. Conclusions: The study found that the quality of life among siblings of children with chronic diseases is good, comparable to that of their peers. The findings imply that the chronicity of the disease does not significantly impair siblings' adaptation and overall well-being. Practice implications: The findings of this study can be used in various fields, including healthcare management, nursing clinical services, nursing education, and nursing research.

It allows us to track attitudes and feelings of the people by analyzing blogs, comments, reviews and tweets about all the aspects. The development of Internet has strong influence in all types of industries like tourism, healthcare and any business. The availability of Internet has changed the way of accessing the information and sharing their experience among users. Social media provide this information and these comments are trusted by other users. This paper recognizes the use and impact of social media on healthcare industry by analyzing the users' feelings expressed in the form of free text, thereby gives the quality indicators of services or features related with them. In this paper, a sentiment classifier model using improved Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) method and linear regression model has been proposed to classify online reviews, tweets or customer feedback for various features. The model involves the process of gathering online user reviews about hospitals and analyzes those reviews in terms of sentiments expressed. Information Extraction process filters irrelevant reviews, extracts sentimental words of features identified and quantifies the sentiment of features using sentiment dictionary. Emotionally expressed positive or negative words are assigned weights using the classification prescribed in the dictionary. The sentiment analysis on tweets/reviews is done for various features using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR) techniques. The proposed linear regression model using the senti-score predicts the star rating of the feature of service. The statistical results show that improved TF-IDF method gives better accuracy when compared with TF and TF-IDF methods, used for representing the text. The senti-score obtained as a result of text analysis (user feedback) on features gives not only the opinion summarization but also the comparative results on various features of different competitors. This information can be used by business to focus on the low scored features so as to improve their business and ensure a very high level of user satisfaction.",0,0,Sentiment analysis; Opinion mining; Sentiment classifier; TF-IDF; Linear regression; online reviews; SOCIAL MEDIA,Review

Healthcare providers working with patients in the continuum of cancer care play essential roles in identifying and addressing mobility impairments. The objective of this article is to present common assistive devices valuable in managing cancer and cancer treatment-related mobility impairments. Methods: Peer-reviewed scientific publications and expert opinions. Results: This article highlights assistive devices commonly used in various settings of cancer care and describes how they address different impairments faced by cancer survivors. The information presented can potentially serve as a resource when training clinical staff (eg, oncology nursing staff) on device provision across all settings. The information can also be useful for patients and caregivers to learn about potential functional impairments linked to cancer and treatments and assistive devices that can be useful to improve patients' functional capacity and reduce caregiver burden. Conclusion: It is essential to involve different team members to identify and select the most appropriate assistive devices that match the patient's functional needs and physical capacity and to train them in device use so they can safely carry out their daily routine. Implications for Nursing Practice: Oncology nurses are one of the first providers to identify mobility impairments in cancer patients. This article will help increase their knowledge in common assistive devices valuable for addressing various mobility impairments associated with cancer and treatments. With additional training on device provision, oncology nurses will be more empowered to collaborate with rehabilitation to identify potential mobility impairments, initiate device provision, and encourage their patients to work with therapy services. Ultimately this could reduce injuries linked to mobility impairments and improve the patient's functional independence and overall quality of life. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: A retrospective review of 965 ethics consultation notes to identify patients aged 18-26 years cared for in the pediatric or adult setting between January 1, 2016-December 31, 2020. We collected demographic information and used conceptual content analysis to identify the primary ethical issue and contextual features for each consult and analyzed these using descriptive statistics. Results: We identified 46 consults (30 adult and 16 pediatric) for 40 unique patients (28 adult and 12 pediatric). The median age was 19 years in the pediatric setting and 24 in the adult setting. Fifty-three percent were female, 95% non-Hispanic, 68% White, and 76% were inpatient. The primary ethical issue in the adult setting was Refusal of Recommended Treatment (20%), while the dominant contextual issue was Communication Disputes/Conflicts Between the Staff and Patient (23%). The primary ethical issue for the pediatric setting was Goals of Care (31%) and the dominant contextual feature was concerns for Quality of Life (31%). Discussion: The primary ethical issues and related contextual features this population experiences differ based on setting. Improved understanding of adolescent and young adult development, especially related to values formation, decision-making, and communication skills training may ameliorate some of these challenges. Referral patterns for this age group overall and particularly for patients on the ends of the spectrum and inpatients raise concerns for ethics consultation use.
