The first day I've waited 45 minutes being 4th on the que. At some point  I realized nothing is going to happen. Rang again minutes later only to be told by another recorded message that 'unfortunately' there are not enough operators to take my call.
The reception have pretty great opening hours - from 12 until 4:20.

I called the next day, when the recorded message about the lack of staff was the first thing I've heard. Same today, this time the message says there will be someone tomorrow. So my question is how many people work on reception and how many days per week?!
In my despair I decided to drop by and just wait on the line, hoping they might have time for me (just to remind everyone I am employed and I am paying for NI every single month)...No luck, I found a massive que of people and I was told they won't be able to take our samples, as they will be closing at 5....

Day 1: Enter A&E just to be told that due to age, its not a problem, they do a nasal swab as an excuse to get rid of us saying the symptoms are due to a viral reaction. We request bloods and urine but are denied.
Day 2: Symptoms are much worse, ended up back in A&E this time they actually get us a blood test, 24 hours later they tell us that its an infection and get us a CT to check for inflammation namely because every symptom was screaming appendicitis (Colitis in the end).
Day 4: finally admitted to a ward, started on antibiotics and oramorph.
After this my partner was discharged a few days later with a new prescription for different antibiotics because the strain was resistant to the ones in hospital. It too me 1 and a half days to collect because I was mucked about by an Nward receptionist who clearly didn't want to help me, until I got a superior involved.

Finally they are now actively refusing to give us a fit note, we spent at least 7 days in the hospital even if only admitted for 5, they watched me wheel her out of the hospital because the furthest she could walk while recovering was to the cafeteria and back.

All of this could have been avoided if they just took us seriously the first time, either by nipping it in the bud before the infection got to the point of hospitalisation, or by putting her into a ward earlier so she could be monitored and administered treatment, completely avoiding the strife and pain we have now both been through (mental and physical)

13,r_3585,Ms R,1,"Subject: Unsafe and Sporadic Accident and Emergency Diagnosis Process – Equality Act Compliance and Professional Conduct Concerns
Unsafe and sporadic Accident and Emergency diagnosis process with front-line nurses and doctors that are not trained in the Public Sector Equality Act, Section 149, and the anticipatory duty they are supposed to have implemented well in advance of 2025.
It's not just about communication — as I complained to the Chief Executive, who rambled on about everything but the fact that I was treated in an inappropriate ""sexist"" manner by the male doctor, as he called me dear and darling to minimalise my pain and did not approach the appointment professionally. He dismissed my complaint of pain in the middle of the wrist and up the side arm bone and told me to go to physiotherapy. He said they didn't have physiotherapy at Chelsea. He treated me as if I had no pain and talked over me, disregarding my comments until the final part of my appointment. Instead of focusing on his job, he was chatting to the other female registrar doctors and making more ""sexist"" snide remarks to them about ""being off for maternity leave and perhaps maybe going to work in gynae was better suited for her return.""
I also heard the same man speaking to two different female patients who came in with chest pain and heart palpitations.
The doctor dismissed the female patients’ symptoms as heartburn, when it is well known that women's heart attacks are often ignored — and as age increases, the percentage of women who die from undiagnosed heart disease and heart attacks goes up, whereas men's does not. While I was listening, I heard two men who had been out during the weekend drinking and smoking (which they said was not their normal behaviour) and who had chest pain. They were given ECGs and all of the necessary tests to make sure they were okay. The unconscious bias and sexism in that Accident and Emergency team is unlawful. It is also evident that they are not trained in how to ask the right questions.
I went to a different hospital, and I did have concussion — because I went to Kingston Hospital, they took a CT scan, and then the consultant listened to my symptoms and said yes, this might take up to five weeks to settle down because I was vomiting — that was not because of ibuprofen. I've been taking ibuprofen for 30 years! The fact that they try to sidestep their responsibilities and then push their accountabilities onto failing machines or primary care is unacceptable, unsafe, and does not take account of the duty of care.
Even if there isn't funding or enough staff, or if male staff are not trained in how to communicate with females in a non-sexist manner that doesn't dismiss women's pain as normal — or with neurodivergent patients like myself, who are also suffering from trauma — they should have trauma-informed training and induction face-to-face, like it used to be when I used to run those courses as part of human resources provision. Treating different patients at a lesser level than those who have no neurodivergent needs puts them at a substantial disadvantage compared to somebody who doesn't need additional support. A person who has previous trauma — and is not asked about it — may be triggered when inappropriate questions are asked or when sexist behaviour occurs.
Human Resources and the Training Department for Equal Rights and Equality under the 2010 Protected Rights Act, and their duty under Section 149, need to look at trauma-informed care and trauma injury after-care.

I came myself there with my husband and mom on Saturday with contractions lasting 1 min in every 2. They admitted us but kept asking if I want to get discharged as my labour is not progressing when it was lasting already 2 mins with 30 secs break in between. From Saturday on Sunday my water finally broke, I asked them what can I do to progress it as from their side there was no help given. Being in complete agony, felt more like they were waiting for me to pass away. There was no offer of C section at all after 2 days in labour. There was only 1 warning been given to me if they continue observing me then I might get an infection. On Saturday night I was admitted to an emergency room as apparently the infection happened. Still no C section was offered, they asked me to sleep by giving me at that point all injections and pain relieves. I woke up at 4am seeing heart off my baby reaching 190 flashing red, I screamt to get me a doctor and begged to cut me to save poor child as being with no water and now heart......... absolutely traumatic experience. At the end doctor asked me to push as at that point it would have been quicker. TG baby is fine. I have lost 2 litres of blood, had an instrumental delivery, several cuts until middle of my bum cheek. Been held in there until Thursday and begged them to discharge me as if I stayed longer I would have litteraly died as they didnt even know what infection I had and asked me where it hurts to understand where the infection is. I have been given plenty of injections I didn't need. As soon as I get home I started feeling better by not taking any medication they gave me.

26,r_262795,Clare Gray,1,"Compassionless and Negligent Baby Loss Care

I chose Chelsea and Westminster for my maternity care and initially had a positive midwifery experience. However, when my baby died, the care I received was terrible. If I had known how unsupported I would be in such a devastating situation, I would have chosen another hospital. I’m sharing my experience in the hope that no other woman will go through what I did.

At nearly 13 weeks pregnant, I attended the hospital for my scan. The sonographer called in a colleague, then told us the baby was measuring 10 weeks and 2 days. We initially thought she was saying the baby had been dated wrongly. Then she said there was no heartbeat. I asked if there was any chance of a mistake — I’d had two previous healthy scans — but was told no. I was given a leaflet and tissues, but no explanation or support. I only realised I’d had a missed miscarriage after overhearing the sonographer on the phone. We were sent home in shock, told another department would call.

The next day we went to the Early Pregnancy Unit (EPU). I sat in tears in the waiting room for over an hour, surrounded by other patients, including a woman with a young baby. My partner asked for help, but staff were indifferent. Eventually, we were taken to a private room. I was told I needed urgent surgery and asked about our preferences for our baby's remains. We were also offered cytogenetic testing, which we agreed to and paid for.

I later attended for surgery, having completed electronic consent forms and elected private cremation for our baby. When we arrived at the Day Centre, my partner was told he couldn't be with me (which I later found out was due to building work) — with no compassion or regard for our situation. I was left alone, visibly distressed. Another patient tried to comfort me, but staff showed little awareness or care.

I was placed in a curtained-off area with chairs, not a proper bay (dressings were stored there and a staff member’s belongings). I felt incredibly vulnerable without privacy. Staff seemed unaware of what surgery I was having or which medications I needed. I asked six different staff members about misoprostol and anti-D. No one seemed to know. I had to show them my patient leaflet. I was distressed and alone, without an advocate.

Only the anaesthetist showed any real kindness. When I finally saw the surgeon, he rushed through the consent process and only discussed our baby's remains. He filled out a new consent form — incorrectly. I was too upset to notice, and this error meant our wishes may not have been followed. We had to chase this through multiple calls and emails to both PALS and the EPU — none of which were answered.

Before surgery, I was told I would be placed on a maternity ward when I woke up — which, after losing a baby, was deeply upsetting. Thankfully, I wasn’t. I was discharged later that day, with no follow-up plan.

Within 24 hours I had severe pelvic pain and later heavy bleeding. I contacted the EPU and was told to wait and see. After further bleeding and calling again, they agreed to scan me. I was told I had retained products of conception. I was offered three options — more surgery , medication, or waiting ). All had further complications risks so I was told to wait three more weeks. I felt completely unsupported.

Due to the poor care I had received, I sought a private second opinion. I was told I needed urgent surgery and paid to have this done. The removed tissue was necrotic — I was told I was lucky not to have developed sepsis, which is life threatening.

At no point was I offered psychological support for my baby loss or the trauma that followed. We made repeated attempts to clarify the mishandled consent form. The only real compassion came from the hospital's chaplaincy team, for which we are deeply grateful.

Nine months on, I am still undergoing treatment and investigations. I wonder how much of this could have been avoided with better care from the outset.

I strongly advise other women to seek maternity care elsewhere.

The receptionist who answered the phone was rude, dismissive and aggressive from the very start. Instead of offering help or guidance she repeatedly snapped that I had the wrong department and that the X-ray department was closed and nothing more. When I politely asked for the correct number or at least some clear instructions on how to proceed she refused, spoke to her colleagues while I was still on the line and then hung up on me.

This is not just unprofessional, it is dangerous. Patients and families call hospitals when they are in pain, distressed and in need of urgent direction. To be treated with hostility, to be denied even the most basic information and then to be cut off is disgraceful.

Hospitals are supposed to be places of care and compassion but this interaction showed the exact opposite. If staff cannot handle calls with decency, patience and respect they should not be in a role where people’s health and safety depend on them. Allowing such behaviour not only erodes trust in the hospital but also risks leaving patients without the urgent care they need.

53,r_405557,Nicola,5,"Guy’s Hospital is a good modern hospital, and my experience there was overwhelmingly positive from start to finish. Located in the heart of London, it’s a busy place, but everything from the organisation to the quality of care made it feel smooth and well-run.

The staff are the real highlight — every nurse, doctor, and support team member I encountered was kind, professional, and genuinely attentive. They took the time to explain things clearly and check in regularly, which made a huge difference in reducing any stress or anxiety. It’s clear that patient care is a top priority here.

The hospital itself is modern and clean, with up-to-date facilities and equipment. Even though it’s a large hospital, it didn’t feel overwhelming. The wards were well maintained, and hygiene standards were consistently high.

They kept me sat on a horrible uncomfortable chair for over 6 hours in A&E with a 40c temperature while I struggled to breathe properly, then told me I have flu and to go home and take paracetamol.
They did not offer me antivirals after doing the blood test to confirm the flu, even though they knew my situation. They did not offer me nebuliser or inhalers even though they could see and hear me struggling to breathe. They did not offer me paracetamol to take home with so I was unable to medicate until the following day because we didn't get out of that place until midnight.

The hospital is terrible. The system is extremely slow and a lot of the nurses kept making obvious errors; one woman was called into the room for the same test over 3 times, until she had to tell them shes already done it and to please stop calling here in. Another patient was sent to a different department, only to be called out by name no less than 10 minutes later, we had to explain they've already sent him out. The nurses then only called the same 2 names for the next hour, even though neither of those patients existed in the room at all.

You are made to feel forgotten, unworthy and weak. The way they spoke to me to tell me ""its just the flu, you can go home"" made me feel so ashamed of even going in, regardless of me being high-risk.

22,r_841273,Jade Welch,5,"I have always had nothing but the utmost professional, honest and wonderful care during my many visits to the JR in Oxford. I am under the Neurosciences department. I am also under the neuromodulation team.

My surgeon, Ms Stana Bojanic has always been lovely, to the point and honest, which I love in a surgeon. Every conversation has been with a caring ear too, especially when I have had moments where I was struggling with pain and/or mobility issues.

Most of my primary care under the neuromodulation team I have dealt with Waclaw Batko and Clare Watson (with some intermittent conversations with others like Carmen Barbato) and all have been truly amazing! Their professionalism mixed with a bit of a softer side, perfect for their job roles for being in close contact with people who tend to be in a lot of pain makes them wonderful to have as a point of contact when we are struggling. They also manage to put things in an easily understandable way without making it worded like you are a 3 year old, as I’ve had with some hospitals due to knee issues in the past. I cannot put into words to praise them highly enough for how much they have helped me and changed my life with this device.

So a simple “thank you” to you all doesn’t seem enough. I’d also like to extend my thanks to all those in the respective teams… As I am well aware there are many that don’t get the thanks they need.

102,r_8042,Louise Thompson,1,"Gaslit nightmare!
Suffered nasty fungal infection for 6 weeks now. Seen by 3 different GPs who all tried different treatments. Pain worsened on Saturday night so called 111 and was sent to Horton A&E early hours of Sunday morning. Doctor there was fantastic. Confirmed infection on sight and also called in a consultant who confirmed swelling was ""bright, tight and hot to touch"". So they immediately sent me to the John Radcliffe SEU via ambulance. In SEU triage, I saw a doctor who told me I need an MRI but the wait can be long, so how would I feel about going home and coming back when an appointment is available. I said no, this is horribly painful and I was sent here because it's urgent. On morphine overnight and saw a consultant on Monday morning rounds. He denied any sign of infection. I was gobsmacked. I asked to see a different doctor who, after going into a room with the consultant and nurse in charge of my care, came out and told me that he agreed with and trusted the consultants opinion - WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING. I asked him to see for himself which he did at protest. He denied seeing any infection. It felt surreal. I was scared, so I emailed PALS who were fantastic. They had me moved to a ward that night where a nurse and yet another doctor looked at me. They confirmed infection and have now been in a bed for 2 days waiting for an ""urgent"" MRI.

27,r_482359,Bushra Ayesha,1,"I recently gave birth at the Golden Jubilee site and unfortunately had a deeply traumatic experience with one of the midwives. While some staff were compassionate and supportive, I experienced serious negligence and unprofessional behaviour that put my baby at risk.

On my first night after an emergency C-section, my baby was placed in a position that was unsafe and could have caused suffocation. Luckily, my partner noticed in time. Despite my repeated requests for support with basic care due to being heavily medicated and physically unwell, the midwife was dismissive, reluctant to assist, and at times made comments suggesting my baby was a burden compared to others in the ward.

Additionally, my concerns about my daughter’s breathing and reflux were dismissed as being “normal for a C-section baby,” which has now led to severe centile dropping. Her jaundice was also not properly monitored or treated once we left the hospital, despite her levels rising on several occasions. Medication was delayed, and my concerns were often ignored or dismissed, leaving me in tears and extremely anxious.

He simply said there was nothing he could do and refused to speak louder, which was frustrating, I felt like my concerns weren’t taken seriously. Sadly, some of the staff also came across as quite dismissive. A bit more kindness and clear communication would have made a difference.

I asked twice for a blanket as I was feeling very cold and faint, but unfortunately, no one responded. I was then sent to another unit (EAU), where I had to sit on a chair even though I had explained that I was in severe discomfort due to my abdominal pain and exhaustion. What surprised me the most was that the hospital was very quiet that night, with no obvious crowd or busyness, yet I felt completely overlooked.

I remained there all night without much attention or updates. In the morning, a nurse simply told me I could go home. Initially, they mentioned prescribing antibiotics, but then changed their minds without much explanation.

I left feeling dismissed, unsupported, and disappointed by the lack of compassion during what was a very frightening time for me.

Today I arrived in A&E at 5PM and was beckoned to speak to the member of staff through a narrow slit in the glass as the microphone/speaker set up was broken. The next stop was triage where a super friendly nurse took down my symptoms and gave me a couple of paracetamol to damp down my fever.  I then had to hand the piece of paper they had filled in at another window, to facilitate check-in to the Emergency Department. I then sat in the first of what turned out to be many waiting rooms where the water machine was broken. Next I was called in to assessment area where I repeated all my symptoms again and handed over my urine sample (which was immediately lost). From there, I went to have blood taken and then returned to the waiting area. An ED doctor came to see me so I detailed my symptoms to them as well and provided a second urine sample. They told me I urgently needed hydration and antibiotics via IV. My next stop was yet another waiting room where I was connected to a  fluid IV which had barely started before it was paused to give me some antibiotics. When the antibiotic IV had finished, the nurse who had started it was not in the department and none of the others were willing to reconnect the fluid drip. I had to wait until  the original nurse had returned, which they eventually did. While in this room I was told I would need to be admitted. Next stop, another waiting room but this time with reclining chairs at least, from where I write this. It is now 02:30 AM, I know that even if I eventually get a bed, I will be woken up at 05:00 for meds and again at 06:00 for blood tests.

108,r_205084,Jenny Le,1,"I am deeply disappointed with the experience my husband and I had with Dr. Imad in A&E. Although the initial two-hour wait was shorter than expected, the consultation itself was rushed and dismissive. Dr. Imad barely took the time to assess my husband’s condition, providing what felt like a 30-second consultation. Despite our request for an X-ray, he refused without much consideration.

To make matters worse, he sent us to a pharmacy that was closed—something that could have easily been avoided if he had considered it was a Sunday. The next day, when we went to the nearest pharmacy to the hospital, we were told there was no prescription available for us. Confused, we returned to A&E for clarification. Instead of being met with empathy, Dr. Imad was visibly frustrated. He walked briskly ahead of us, almost as if he were trying to get rid of us, while giving directions to the actual hospital pharmacy. When we explained that we had simply assumed the closest pharmacy was the correct one, he curtly told us, “Then you didn’t listen to me.”

Both my husband and I were exhausted, fasting, and dealing with his severe pain. It would have been easy to mishear or misunderstand directions in that state, but instead of showing any compassion, Dr. Imad was condescending and impatient. His lack of empathy and dismissive attitude were incredibly disheartening, especially coming from someone in a profession meant to provide care and support.

After several weeks and just a few days before they refused it saying their protocols had not been followed. This is NOT a legal requirement! To help me, my surgery filled in their forms, again marked the referral as urgent. They sent it back, saying protocol not fully complied with. My surgery argued the case and they said they would have a clinical review and get back. That was 12th Nov. We didn't get a reply. My surgery followed up. They were told no one to type up dictated notes. It's now 8th Dec and my surgery has sent them another email and copied me in and told them that as well. My family has 2 doctors in it. We believe in the NHS. We support the NHS. But Kings is a disgrace. We know the problems faced by the NHS, mainly caused by the Tories but Kings has been a problem for some time. Go to the Brompton or Royal Orthopaedic and it's a different ball game. Professional, caring people, from the bottom to the top. Kings is a problem due to its management. They need an overhaul. They need a shakeup. There is no need for this appalling travesty of a hospital. I intend to contact members of government and shame them. You are a disgrace Kings.

It's now almost another week and despite my GP's email, we have still not had a reply! Amazing as the documentation from my surgery marked my condition as URGENT. 3 months Kings. You are useless

Guess what, only got a reply a couple of days ago after my surgery repeatedly called and tried to get through. They said I didn't need surgery but another intervention first. They didn't read the notes, it was already done! I'm lodging a complaint, which I will post here on how to do it. My surgery is now referring me to another hospital, I DON'T trust Kings

Update. Was referred to RNOH Stanmore. Kings findings TOTALLY wrong on their last report. Wrong diagnosis, wrong treatment! They wanted me to go to a pain clinic, Stanmore recommended surgery as soon as they saw the scan!  If I continue without it, I will require more pain medication and will end up in a wheelchair. That's the verdict of the consultant. Shame on you Kings. Shame on the people who looked at my results and got it SO WRONG.

Fiona, and the other head nurse!!!!

Fiona looks at me with a very patronising ton.  ""I will let the nurse know"" for the next hour no one came!! I went back and she looked at me sorry we are busy doing a handover give us 5 minutes.

I would like to thank in particular my surgeon, Dr Emmanuel, and his team together with the entire staff at the Coptcoat ward, where I stayed. They were professional, attentive, upbeat and helped me go through a serious challenge almost without feeling it.

The results were amazing, not only in terms of efficacy but also in terms of speed in recovery.

There was a glitch though: an unethical communication issue in which I was not told that there was a last minute change of the head surgeon in charge of my operation.

I’ve checked the GMC and NHS websites and this directly contradicts the fabrications they had tried to feed us, as patients DO  have the right to refuse a transplant or if they prefer a family member. He had done this deliberately in order to questions pertaining to my aunties health condition. He then attempted to tell me to ‘get out’ as I’d explained she did not need an interpreter as she was with me (a relative) who she has requested to help support her. He was extremely dismissive and unprofessional, when my aunty explained that she did not require a translator. He then attempted to accuse me of saying I’d forced her to say that. This caused extreme distress for my aunty and I have video proof of this, which I will be sharing with PALS, in order to review duty of care for vulnerable patients under the care of these two men.

To add insult to injury, the ‘head nurse’ on duty - a man named Jamie, attempted to double down on his colleagues assumption that she is being co-erced - although, they were trying to take away her right to consenting to a translator. None of her needs were taken into account and this startled my aunty. This conversation caused my aunty distress and asked him to leave repeatedly. Jamie then asked to speak to me privately and patronisingly asked me to ‘go get some rest for my eyes’ which was unwarranted and walked away and refused to engage, making us wait an extra 5 hours before being seen by another health care professional. Jamie refused to come after I had called for him after wars. Worst hospital ever, please don’t attempt to go there if you’re ever in need of urgent care.

Since when was it hospital policy to force someone without consent to use a translator? It seems as though they’re letting anyone into healthcare these days. So called ‘senior’ Doctors who lack compassion, and a clear understanding of their roles such as Fadal are an absolute disgrace to this profession and do not possess the knowledge, empathy or understanding to work with vulnerable patients and I worry deeply for patients who are vulnerable and under his care. This situation has led to my aunty having a severe mistrust of the healthcare system in the UK. I’ll be filing an official complaint with the evidence I have of this situation. Patients, please be wary about Doctor Fadal in the A&E unit.

It’s such a shame that a ‘senior doctor’ and ‘head nurse’ (lol) will try to fob you off as much as possible, under the guise of ‘policy’ that isn’t contextual to the needs of the patient or true at all: therefore, please make sure that you’re well versed on the GMC and NHS guidelines. It’s such a shame that you have to come prepared with the bureaucracy and fodder that some of the nurses and doctors at Kings College Hospital such as Fadal and Jamie will do.

*I just wanted to add that the rest of the team we dealt with were amazing and gave us the due diligence and care required. Fadal and James making up delusional fantasies about ‘coercion’ was proved wrong when an amazing consultant provided me with the correct information AND allowed the opportunity for my shanty to ask questions via a translator. This was a massive win and my aunty left feeling extremely happy and having trust restored in the healthcare system.

I can’t understand how or why they believe they are entitled to act like this. Most people complaining could not grasp simple instructions and information, this was due to people either not listening or not hearing what they wanted to. Examples of what they have to put up with included one patient complaining they mispronounced his surname so didn’t come forward when called! It was ACU staff fault he missed  the first opportunity to be seen! Another arguing with a receptionist that their partner condition was serious cause the gp said so, whereas the doctors within the ACU after further test said it wasn’t. As a result they would have to wait. There delightful person was threatening to sue. What idiots! They left in the end, so he clearly care that much for his partner if he really thought it was life threatening!

Once you pass this point and go into the ED, it completely goes down hill.

I requested some painkillers and told them I had started to get shooting pain in my neck - I never got these painkillers. Told the doctor I didn’t get them, still received nothing from them.
The doctors and nurses are rude and wouldn’t tell you even if your hair was on fire. I get it’s a stressful job but it’s a job that YOU chose and you have a duty of care for these patients.
There is a clear failure for patients in this hospital, no urgency, security are rude, every single staff member other than receptionists and porters are rude. You are made to feel like an inconvenience by them.

The nurses last night shift weren’t nice or nurse assistants tbh. I couldn’t keep anything down & body was going into shock as severley dehydrated & exteme nausea. I got told to sleep on the cold floor waiting 3hrs until I got 1x shot of anti sickness in my arm. I got left waiting for it to kick in but bc of the dehydration I kept sipping water n vomiting even more. Wasn’t offered fluids or a bed as sitting up kept making me pee myself & vomit. They said I had nothing else for me, I said I will discharge myself and rest at home still knowing I wasn’t feeling good and couldn’t sleep on the cold floor any longer. I went home could not sleep due to nausea / vomiting and went back to MRI to get told to go to another hospital which I did North Manchester who were superb. The triage nurse also told me I was being quite rude to staff? Why they don’t want to see me. I wasn’t being rude I was left on the floor in pool of my own sick n pee and was requesting more sickness or privacy as my clothes were drenched in sick. I went to north Manchester where they put a canula in straight away after checking in & gave me a drip of anti sickness and a 1hr IV fluid which severely helped me. I got another anti sickness drip & got discharged by 10:30am with some Omeprazole & Cyclezine. All in all, MRI usually are very helpful and have looked aftered me super well in the past. This really upset me that at 5am they refused to see me bc apparently I was rude to staff? I was crying & sick.. I’m 28 and come from a dental background, never cursed or threatened. All I did was go to the reception numerous times to ask for anti sickness or some help. Post 10hrs, I’m in my own bed, just licking soup of a spoon & self healing with North Manchester Dr’s advice. May be my next go to hospital even though MRI is 5mins away from me. Saddened but low key expected from the second triage nurse or assistant. He was a Asian guy, green uniform & was the one who did my bloods who I found was rude & complained against me for using the plastic room to vomit in privately with which was empty.

Staff spoken to me like I was trash and seemed to be enjoying the spectacular show of watching a desperate and sick man in close to the most pain that is humanely possible whilst alive.

Here is what should have been done:

“Treating Precipitated Withdrawal

The principle is simple: provide a high dose of buprenorphine to maximize its agonist effects combined with a single low dose of benzodiazepine to address fear and anxiety. The standardized approach presented here should be applied as quickly as possible.”

However, the incredible NHS gave me absolutely nothing. The Doctor was even considering reversing the condition which could have put me through immense torture followed by death. Why not just go forward with what I had already initiated and I could have walked out of there today successfully inducted on the Medicine that I spent the last several months fighting to be able to make the switch to? Instead I have taken several steps backwards and I am forced into going back on the Medication that I just spent countless years coming off.

They then told me to walk home in the lovely rain alone whilst on deaths door being full blown tortured; and refused to call a taxi or show any compassion whatsoever. Another patient who witnessed this spoke to me outside and said well done for what I was attempting. He was astounded at the arrogance of the Staff. He was also convinced that they seemed to be enjoying the suffering they were seeing and hearing.

Never again. The only time that place and those awful people will be seeing me again is when they scrape me off my floor deceased, I recently opted out of default Organ Doner NHS status.

I am genuinely traumatised by the ordeal. I will never call 999 for an Ambulance Ever again. The two Ambulance girls were okay. However their words were misleading because if I would have known they were going to give me absolutely nothing and then tell me to get walking through the rain home whilst severely sick I would never have got in the Ambulance.

NHS is best for lonely elders who fancy a bit of an adventure to pass the time and not feel so alone.Also any Foreign nationals would like the experience as they get a bed and have the protection of Equality to ensure they are not treated the way they treated me.

But for the sake of quickly prescribing a couple of Diazepam and drip dosing Buprenorphine until I stabilised within 12 to 24 hours. They clearly chose to give me nothing including no respect or understanding.

Poor communication — waited 5 extra hours for results without being told the doctor had ordered a CT scan two hours earlier.

Unnecessary suffering — my mother was left in pain for hours due to lack of updates and action.

Staff disinterest — many staff appeared uninterested in patients and more focused on personal activities.

Lack of professionalism — behaviour suggested some staff lacked the basic training or common sense expected in urgent care.

Neglect of urgent patients — urgent cases were not treated as a priority.

Inappropriate behaviour — staff “playing games” while patients were waiting and suffering.

Disgraceful standard of care — a total failure of compassion, respect, and responsibility.

Loss of trust — I will never bring a loved one to this hospital again.

49,r_578878,Dimitra Argyriou,1,"I received an email today demanding proof of my right to stay in the UK. The tone of the email was quite intimidating, suggesting that I would be charged for the entire treatment and that they would inform my GP to update their records because I didn't respond. However, I haven't received any email or letter from them. I also regularly check my spam and MyMFT. The woman who sent the email from the Overseas Chargeable Patients Service claimed she had sent it by post. I left the hospital just last week (Thursday), so it makes sense that I need a little time to receive the letter.

Why is there such a need to intimidate patients? Give us time to breathe; I am still recovering, show a bit of respect. I’ve been dealing with a heart infection, and I won't even mention the eight-hour wait I endured the first day, trying to see a doctor through incredible pain. I was asking for a doctor to explain to me what was going on for ten hours the day when I was admitted to the hospital, and nobody came to see me until 10 PM since 12 am.

When I returned to the hospital yesterday for a fer injection, the doctor requested a blood test, but nobody took blood for the test. Finally, the doctor did it. Your services are incredibly slow, yet you demand things from patients without even proper communication. It’s terrible service.

The woman I spoke to didn’t like it when I explained that I haven’t received the letter, so why did she dare to threaten me with charges and updates to my GP? She didn't like that. She hung up the phone, claiming that she felt intimidated by me. How rude and weak are you? Why? Because I said, I could prove that she created anxiety in a patient with an already vulnerable health for no reason? You think you are entitled to threaten me, and I have to feel fear of you?

The whole experience has been horrific. I  used NHS services to feel better, not worse. It's unbelievable to witness such a lack of responsibility for errors made on your part!
I didn't have any reason to avoid responding; I just had to prove my settle status with a shared code; it was so easy! Terrible, terrible and rude! You think with your fake thank you and sorry you are polite! Ridiculous

Short Review – Patient Experience at Manchester Royal Infirmary

During my recent visit to Manchester Royal Infirmary, I experienced significant delays and poor communication. Patients were left waiting over six hours, with staff repeatedly calling the same names without coordination or clear purpose. There was a noticeable lack of clear information when inquiries were made, leaving many patients feeling confused and ignored.

It could be better if the English word was understood and spoken instead of misunderstandings! Fighting between staff in front of patients should be a sackable offence and lying to patients needs to cease. We are in pain and trying to recover and most definitely do not need this because it has a knock on effect! There are staff walking around in scrubs because they have not got the correct uniform and who are not allowed to perform certain tasks; some patients with mental health issues are thinking that they are surgeons and qualified doctors-buy the correct uniform. They spend on these stupid air mattresses that do you more harm than good, but the staff have to sing the same tune "" it prevents bed sores."" pfffft! Cleaning is in the morning, so you hold going to the toilet because the person before messed it up - no infection control yet they swab your rear and groin to check for infections 🤷‍♂️. I am disappointed with some of the staff, the ones that showed empathy know who they are, it's a shame the rest are to blind to see what's happening. I've witnessed a lot of ill treatment and heard a lot of horrendous stories from other patients and despite being ignored and not listened to, I made a few good friends and will be keeping in touch.  I think my surgeons were amazing they did my bypass and made sure they informed me of what they did, which I find is excellent bedside manner and they understood pain management ( I can't speak for those who complained on my vascular ward) I received what I needed and was up and about by day 3&4. They didn't stock a dressing called Softpore which I'm used to, instead they put a dressing on with plastic film ( I did tell them that I'm allergic to that type of plaster), I had a red hospital bracelet which advises that you have allergies. I had to go to the 24/7 restaurant because I couldn't eat the hospital food; I tried to educate some staff on the dangers of diabetics going into a hypo, but they looked at me as if I fell from the moon.

12,r_221800,Skip Anjal,2,"My grandmother was admitted to City Hospital after what began as an infection was later diagnosed as pneumonia. During her stay, further tests revealed she had lung cancer, news that was delivered to her without care or compassion. For two months, she was placed in Fleming Ward, where the experience became more distressing than supportive. Despite being on end-of-life care, the staff did not communicate openly with us about her condition. We arrived just twenty minutes before she passed away, leaving us little chance to say goodbye properly.

Throughout her stay, the standard of care was deeply troubling. She often waited long periods for assistance after pressing her call button, sometimes up to half an hour. On several occasions, she was handled roughly, and once she was even dropped. At night, doctors would remind her bluntly of her diagnosis, showing little regard for her emotional state. When she struggled to eat and drink, no IV drip was provided, even though family members with medical knowledge suggested it. Requests for simple interventions, like a blood test, were poorly managed and left her in pain.

Her dignity was often ignored. She was left exposed during bed changes, made to wait uncomfortably for the commode, and denied basic comforts such as adequate bedding or access to a fan. The ward environment felt cold, unwelcoming, and at times unhygienic. Family members were even reprimanded for small things, like getting water.

On her final days, she appeared frightened and withdrawn, expressing feelings of being mistreated and unwanted. Her last words reflected a deep sense of mistrust and sadness. What should have been a place of care and comfort in her final weeks instead became a source of suffering, leaving our family heartbroken and appalled.",a month ago,1,0,en,Nottingham_City_Hospital,2025-10-06 19:37:39.260450,my grandmother was admitted to city hospital after what began as an infection was later diagnosed as pneumonia during her stay further tests revealed she had lung cancer news that was delivered to her without care or compassion for two months she was placed in fleming ward where the experience became more distressing than supportive despite being on end of life care the staff did not communicate openly with us about her condition we arrived just twenty minutes before she passed away leaving us little chance to say goodbye properly throughout her stay the standard of care was deeply troubling she often waited long periods for assistance after pressing her call button sometimes up to half an hour on several occasions she was handled roughly and once she was even dropped at night doctors would remind her bluntly of her diagnosis showing little regard for her emotional state when she struggled to eat and drink no iv drip was provided even though family members with medical knowledge suggested it requests for simple interventions like a blood test were poorly managed and left her in pain her dignity was often ignored she was left exposed during bed changes made to wait uncomfortably for the commode and denied basic comforts such as adequate bedding or access to a fan the ward environment felt cold unwelcoming and at times unhygienic family members were even reprimanded for small things like getting water on her final days she appeared frightened and withdrawn expressing feelings of being mistreated and unwanted her last words reflected a deep sense of mistrust and sadness what should have been a place of care and comfort in her final weeks instead became a source of suffering leaving our family heartbroken and appalled,"['grandmother', 'admitted', 'city', 'began', 'infection', 'later', 'diagnosed', 'pneumonia', 'stay', 'test', 'revealed', 'lung', 'cancer', 'news', 'delivered', 'without', 'compassion', 'two', 'month', 'placed', 'fleming', 'experience', 'became', 'distressing', 'supportive', 'despite', 'end', 'life', 'communicate', 'openly', 'condition', 'arrived', 'twenty', 'minute', 'passed', 'away', 'leaving', 'little', 'chance', 'say', 'goodbye', 'properly', 'throughout', 'stay', 'standard', 'deeply', 'troubling', 'often', 'waited', 'long', 'period', 'assistance', 'pressing', 'call', 'button', 'sometimes', 'half', 'hour', 'several', 'occasion', 'handled', 'roughly', 'dropped', 'night', 'doctor', 'remind', 'bluntly', 'diagnosis', 'showing', 'little', 'regard', 'emotional', 'state', 'struggled', 'eat', 'drink', 'drip', 'provided', 'though', 'family', 'member', 'medical', 'knowledge', 'suggested', 'request', 'simple', 'intervention', 'blood', 'test', 'poorly', 'managed', 'left', 'pain', 'dignity', 'often', 'ignored', 'left', 'exposed', 'bed', 'change', 'wait', 'uncomfortably', 'commode', 'denied', 'basic', 'comfort', 'adequate', 'bedding', 'access', 'fan', 'environment', 'felt', 'cold', 'unwelcoming', 'time', 'unhygienic', 'family', 'member', 'reprimanded', 'small', 'thing', 'getting', 'water', 'final', 'day', 'appeared', 'frightened', 'withdrawn', 'expressing', 'feeling', 'mistreated', 'unwanted', 'last', 'word', 'reflected', 'deep', 'sense', 'mistrust', 'sadness', 'place', 'comfort', 'final', 'week', 'instead', 'became', 'source', 'suffering', 'leaving', 'family', 'heartbroken', 'appalled']",1,0.37504572

Athira - always took time to ask how the patient (Faisal) was doing including me (Parent). Extremely polite, kind, attentive and genuine.

Eunice - always greeted me with a smile which was contagious and warming. Very caring and always ensured Faisal had what he needed. Built rapport and remembed details from conversations. Periodically checked in on us and asked if we need anything. Took extra care with responding to our requests and did so swiftly.

Sini- Treated faisal with the upmost respect by talking directly to him and kept him clearly informed in simple terms of what she was doing & explaned why. Made us feel confident in the care and process at every stage.

Sonia - greeted me each time with a smile and eye contact, made me feel valued and always explained each stage of treatment or care that was provided, like Sini, did so in a clear and simple manner.

He fell out the bed when no-one was there and fractured his femur. Transferred to Heartlands for surgery to have it pinned together. 2 weeks later fell out the bed in Heartlands hospital! They knew he was high risk - yet again apologies as no one present in bay?? Another head bleed from falling! Had to stop blood thinners because he had a clot following surgery! Then moved to West Heath for assessment where it would be decided where he was to go after eg care home or back home. 2 weeks fell poorly - shaking, high temperature. Asked if they had checked for Sepsis. They did this on the Monday and sure enough it was sepsis. Rushed to QE to be waiting 10 hours in 4 different ambulances. Developed a bed sore, no fluids or drink as had to have thickeners in water. Finally a bed in A&E for 1 day and moved to AMU then to a ward in main hospital. Can't find sources of sepsis, weeing blood, trying to get out of bed, mrsa so DOLs involved and padded gloves on both hands (boxing gloves) to stop him pulling catheter out and getting out of bed.

After a trip she had to AMU a few weeks ago my mom was told she had a suspected Blood clot in her leg which was believed to be the cause of her very swollen left knee & leg. AMU were great with her and provided medication to take and gave a discharge letter with appointment on it for a scan at DVT clinic on 12th September (today).
Upon arriving at 11am like the letter stated the department could not find my mom on their list, we then got sent to another department where we were told she had been booked an appointment which simply did not exist 😩😳well that’s more than fine isn’t it especially when she’s already waited 2 weeks to find out if she had a blood clot in her leg and does not know if she needs to be taken the blood thinner tablets the hospital had instructed her to take.
As anyone could imagine I was very upset close to tears as I had to book the day off from work today to take my mom to this phantom appointment that we didn’t know didn’t exist until we got there, my mom can’t manage to get to the hospital without my assistance due to how badly her mobility has been of late.
After 3 hrs in the hospital and passed between 4 departments I only found 2 nurses in DVT unit to be genuinely sorry for the massive error that someone had made, yet it wasn’t their fault to begin with. Now it’s another 2.5 week wait for a scan appointment, my mom needs to have someone with her as she does not always retain information well and they only offered crack of dawn appointments which I could not accompany her to and that would have been only a few days before 29th anyway.
A total lack of care and respect for the elderly no one seemed very concerned in most of the departments we went to. And all of this to a lady who served the NHS herself as a Nurse at the old accident hospital at Bath row Birmingham back in the 70’s.

The Ambulance staff were absolutely amazing thats where it all changed.

Upon arrival I was informed by the Ambulance Crew that I had to be taken off the stretcher, and put into a wheel chair, even thou they informed the A&E staff this wasn't possible due to the injury I had. (Slipped disc and trapped siatic nerve) I was then left standing in A&E for over 2hrs before I got assessed and given pain relief, via morthpine,  however this was given to me standing up, where I felt very wozzy. Again no bed was offered, and the drug was given to me in a corridor where she left the seringe in my arm whilst she went and checked her paper work.

After another 2hrs I was told to go into a consultation room to be assessed, after 40mins of waiting a nurse entered the room and told me to get out as the room as it was needed for another patient. I tried to explain that the pain I was in it was not possible for me to do so, she was very rude, and told me and my wife to vacate the room now, and to wait in the waiting area, again standing in a lot of pain.

Finally at 04.37hrs I was seen by a Dr and told that they know what my injury is and to go and see my GP inregards to a scan, I was told to move from there to the treatment centre where I was given some more morthine and a diclofenac suppositorie. Then I was told I could go home.

My wife asked for pain relief for when I get home as the morphine would wear off in the morning. We were told that they had ran out of pain relief and to go to the pharmacy in the morning.

I'm now at home with no pain relief and the suppositories are still not ready, leaving me in alot of pain.

The service I received from all of the A&E staff was absolutely shameful, and to be sent home in pain with no pain relief is totally diabolical.

No empathy was shown at all by any of the nurses in that department. Being a former employee of the QEHB and seeing how the department is now was a complete shock.

50,r_896191,G Sacurom,1,"I am extremely disappointed with the infection control standards at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham.

On Friday, 15th August 2025 (Ward 518, Room 3), Sister Nurse Otilla (Team Leader) was about to administer my husband’s PEG feed without wearing gloves. When I raised my concern, she argued with me and said: “Why do I need to wear gloves? Should I wear gloves when feeding him through his mouth as well?” These were her exact words. Only after I strongly insisted did she put on gloves. I found this behaviour unprofessional and unacceptable, especially from a Team Leader who should set the example for others.

In addition, when my husband was in AMU Bay E, Bed 25, on the 13th August, nurse Hadiqa caring for him did not wear gloves at all, even though nearby patients had visible wound infections. This creates a serious risk of cross-contamination and endangers patients’ health.

56,r_843117,Shauna Wordley,1,"This was my dad’s main hospital during his terminal cancer treatment. Due to the type of cancer he had, he had to have a feeding tube fitted as he could not eat food orally. The staff at this hospital fit the feeding tube and the same night he was back in a local hospital with signs of sepsis as they had fitted it wrong and it was piercing his stomach lining. They didn’t even bother checking to see if it was fit correctly through a scan / checked if it was measured correctly for his size. Because of this, he had to stay in hospital for 3 weeks with infection & had to have the feeding tube re-fitted. When he finally went back to queen Elizabeth to see if he could continue his cancer treatment they said no due to losing so much weight being in hospital for so long with minimal food. His McMillan nurse was absolutely awful towards him saying that “these things happen” and being completely dismissive. As a trained PROFESSIONAL these things should not just happen and had the correct precautions been taken while the feeding tube was being fitted then my dad would have been able to continue his cancer treatment and may have been here for longer. I feel completely let down by the staff that’s main priority is meant to be the patient, especially the McMillan team who get so much praise but the only time my dad ever saw or heard off them was when he was physically in hospital and didn’t check on him.

After the test results came back (about 2 hours later), I saw the doctor who then informed me that an additional element needed to be checked in my blood — something that, in my opinion, should have been tested in the first place.

Dr Thaller was absolutely amazing, he was very welcoming towards me and my mom, he asked both of us questions and he then explained to me about what treatment options were available to help with my migraines and he didn't interrupt me, Dr Thaller was very knowledgeable about some of the things that might trigger a migraine attack and he made me feel at ease throughout my appointment.

I would also like to thank the staff who guided us to where we needed to go. Also I would like to thank the gentleman on the main outpatient reception for booking me in because the self service kiosk wouldn't scan my appointment letter it kept saying that there was no record of the appointment.

The reason why I was at Queen Elizabeth Hospital is because the Neurologist at Walsall Manor Hospital wanted a second opinion due to medication not working to stop my migraines and so I was referred to Dr Thaller's headache clinic and I am grateful I was given an appointment 2-3 months after my Neurology appointment at Walsall Manor Hospital.

Part 1) I arrived as always 30 minutes before my appointment so 8:30am and decided to grab a bite to eat beforehand so chose the “spice of life restaurant” in the foyer next to Costa which I haven’t tried before.
After initially being ignored I ordered a sausage and bacon bap. Asked if I wanted a drink I decided against that as the prices for a coffee ranged from £3.60 to over £4. I was charged £5.70 for the bap omg! After picking myself up off the floor I made my way to the seating areas. The tables are all very badly stained and the floor was disgusting, chairs with stains on and littered with food matter. It looked filthy and unsanitary I was shocked that I was expected to sit here and eat food. I decided to sit around in the costa coffee part as the tables looked cleaner. Anyway the first bite of the bap was absolutely disgusting, both the bacon and the sausage were cold and the bacon was gross, not much meat and far more fat than anyone could stomach this early in the morning and dripping in grease. The sausage skin was so tough I had to take it out to bite it and bap was drier than the bottoms of Jesus’s sandals. The bread just disintegrated in my hands, it’s unforgivable for a hospital concession to serve this dog food. Needless to say I abandoned it and left.
Part 2) Made my way to the normal out patient dept needing in mind I have been coming here for some years, at reception the administration staff member didn’t even lift her head to greet me but just looked disinterested and said “date of birth?” Then turned to a male staff member at the desk and said “should she sit down here?”
I could see the waiting area was very busy already and some patients were coughing so I asked the male staff member for a FRSM (Fluid Resistant Surgical Mask) he said “what’s one of them?” I then said a mask please can I have a face mask?
He then HANDED ME A MASK FROM A BOX ON THE DESK but it slipped onto the floor
NO 1 RULE: DO NOT HANDLE THE FACE MASK AS A THIRD PARTY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM!!!!!!
He then proceeded to hand me another before I said please do not handle the masks for me that goes against everything we have been advised since COVID? He then shrugged his shoulders and gave me the box. Unfortunately he wasn’t wearing his name badge so I cannot identify him.

I’m extremely disappointed around the way I have been treated today. From the catering staff to the clinical. No sign of putting patients FIRST and clear breaches of INFECTION PREVENTION & CONTROL PROTOCOLS
I know the NHS is in crisis but haven’t witnessed anything first hand until today.
Following my appointment I cried in the car having felt 100 % let down by the service  and very overwhelmed by it all.

152,r_744748,Selena,1,"Bad. Bad bad BAD! I’ve never been so humiliated and embarrassed when in the worst moments of my life. I was having episodes of excruciating pain and weeklong flares of excessive nausea & vomiting and I needed help. I repeatedly visited the A&E over 3 years whilst at University. I had no clue what my issue was, but it turned out to be a simple one. They always ran basic bloods, gave IV fluids for severe dehydration, told me everything was fine and sent me on my way. I was repeatedly berated by staff for being “in the way” and asked why I had come here as i’ve been before and nothing had been found, so why was I back, what did I expect from them? I EXPECTED MEDICAL HELP. I was scared and suffering, away from everyone I knew. Why would I want to be in the worst place imaginable whilst suffering, for fun?? So many stories I could tell about the nightmares of this hospital. This was not my first port of call, I had been to my GP, urgent care, walk in centres so many times just looking for ANYONE to listen and help me, but because I was young no one cared and was always told it was stress, anxiety or, my personal favourite diagnosis of “too much google”. I couldn’t even pick up a pen never mind look at a phone. I was 18 so had no idea what the proper route was to get help and was too sick to do anything but what I was told by “professionals”, which was go home, wait and see. At one point I was given medication that I was allergic to and vomited in the street having a reaction on my way home. They also gave me steroids and made me take them then and there and sent me home. All 8 pills, on an empty stomach of over a week. No advice or explanation as to what it was. It was the most excruciating experience I have ever had the displeasure of existing in.
After being told repeatedly by my GP and hospitals in Birmingham (over THREE YEARS) that nothing was wrong with me and I essentially needed to get a grip, a simple trip to my GP in my home town up North found that I was riddled with massive gallstones. Because of the negligence of birmingham doctors, my health and immune system has plummeted and my body no longer wants to absorb any vitamins — they are dangerously low. I live in fear of food and have no appetite from the length and depth of suffering I experienced. I have a phobia of ANY new medication from the pain of my stomach turning itself inside out from countless incorrect meds and advice from this hospital. I suffered from multiple chest infections and serious complications as a side effect of my body deteriorating slowly over the 3 years I tried to seek help from anyone. Viral gastroenteritis slapped on every diagnosis (NEVER mentioned to me). At 21 my liver is now severely damaged and I am in pain every day of my life. Laughable that my liver levels were one of the only “further” things tested and picked up on in this hospital, but was NEVER mentioned to me. When I asked for my records (which was a difficult process) there was a clear deterioration of my liver upon every test. Three years later I am still trying to get to the bottom of this. My results are now off the charts. I have a vitamin D of 10, and nothing will help it. TEN. The treatment in this hospital is disgraceful. I experienced it and I saw it all around me. You will only receive help if you are actively dying. They don’t have time for anything else. At one point they told me I was having a pulmonary embolism and sent me home to come back the next day as it was “too late” and the machine was closed. They gave me a blood thinner that made me feel like a pile of mashed potatoes and sent me on my way. When I asked for pain relief for my severe pain I was told to go buy some paracetamol and it was slapped on my permanent records that i’m desperate for analgesics and to watch out for me.

It can cause debilitating symptoms to many parts of the body. Thus, i have had many surgeries. My most recent being another lengthy surgery. Its always frightening to be so poorly that you can bearley move for pain. However, my experience at QEHB has been excellent. Last year i became ill, once again with complications which could have lead to sepsis. Following regular consultations with Gastroenterology and Dermatology, a plastic surgeon was involved. This was concerning, of course, but i realised it was necessary... my quality of life was very poor. The surgery, in September (2024), was a success. I came out of theatre feeling better than i have felt in several years. I was no longer in pain, and my fear of sepsis diminished. I have often spoken to an IBD community for sharing and advice. I was not alone in my suffering, but others were so afraid of long and complicated surgeries for fear of ""disfigurement"". I am now happy to let others know that living with such a disabling condition was not an option for me, and could be helpul to others who have been struggling for too many years. Years of medical treatments can also cause ill effects as well as reistance. Antibiotics are one thing but spending many years on opiates can be damaging too, adding more complications to an already difficult disease.

My grandmother was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia and a virus. We were admitted to the emergency room in a serious condition.
Due to the lack of rooms in the respiratory department, we waited 27 hours in the emergency room for a bed in the right department - but all the necessary treatment was prescribed.
Then we were transferred to the respiratory department, I have never seen such service and treatment!
All medications, artificial lung ventilation, oxygen, massage, computed tomography, X-rays, heart cardiogram, blood tests, regular checks (every 2 hours), immediate responses to needs, choice of food on the menu, water change, bedding, in my absence - doctors called me and reported the plan and results of the work done, cleaning was at the highest level.
The doctors come to the revue twice a day with a clear plan and conclusions, what has been done and what will be done and whether it is effective.
I am shocked that my grandmother said that her legs hurt and the head doctor (not a physiotherapist) lay down on the floor and began to massage her legs + called a physiotherapist and began to do exercises and prescribed treatment for her legs.
At night, she had a fever, so the nurses started wiping her from sweating and changed her clothes.
The treatment itself is very effective, every day my grandmother felt better than yesterday and it was noticeable.
Beds, equipment - everything is at the highest level, you won't see this in private hospitals.
I can write a lot, but in one word, SHORTLAND MEDICINE is TOP !!!

Before all that, I was left inside the corridor by the main entrance when brought in by the ambulance with not even given a blanket and left in my boxers. In the ambulance, they cut open my clothes but had no blanket, and when we arrived at the royal london I was left in the corridor at main entrance in full view of everyone for hours. Not one member of staff thought it was a bad look to have someone laying on an ambulance stretcher almost naked at their main entrance. But they made it a priority that I wasn't allowed to move or even if it meant to use the toilet - but they gave me a bottle made of cardboard, as a substitute for a toilet! When I finally was taken in for x-ray I was physically assaulted by the staff member, as this staff member struggled to understand that being flattened by a van had left me severely injured and treated me as though I was putting up resistance. My helmet would also be stolen somehow, and the staff argued with me that its something I didn't need anymore (or was important) because it was damaged. The staff were just trying their absolute best to get rid of me and didn't hide it. So much so, it was until I made it home, that a needle was found still left in my arm from when they took my blood! USELESS staff, so much so it was no surprise that my official complaint was brush under the carpet by their complaints  team - their official excuse for their staff conduct and me being discharged the same day from an accident was that they were experiencing some glitch with their computer system that day. But I know NEVER to seen in that place again - it's a shame that place and its staff can't be given less than 1 star because if I could I'll give them a minus grade!......oh and two days later from being discharged, I went to another hospital (a proper one) and their x-rays found both my arms had breakages and placed them in castes

54,r_398417,Shehab El Nawawi,5,"A few days ago I had the most severe pain in my lower abdomen and after a few hours in agony my wife and I went to the Emergency ward at the Royal London Hospital.
It was crowded and everyone was really busy but I was looked at by a nurse after about an hour’s wait and then sent to the UTS department. It took another couple of hours before a second nurse took some more data and did a few other tests.
I was then seen by a GP who sent me for a CT scan that later confirmed that I had a kidney stone.
After the scan the renal consultant spoke with me twice. The second time to confirm the diagnosis and to give me my prescription, that I subsequently picked up from the hospital’s pharmacy.
All in all it took about 10 hours to do the preliminary testing, urine and blood test and the CT scan, and to get my diagnosis and prescription.

I am writing this post to thank the medical team that treated me; the nurses, radiologist, GP and renal consultant along with everyone else who works at this hospital, especially the security and cleaning staff and the young nurse who came around to the waiting area to take everyone’s blood pressure. (I went on the 1st of September at around 11pm and left on the 2nd at around 8am. )

I was afforded the best possible service from start to finish, and all with a smile. Thank you all for this wonderful service.

Finally I would like to mention that I am visiting from Canada and that in spite of not being a UK resident I received this fantastic service. What is even more amazing is that when I asked for my bill the young lady looked at me and said that I owed them nothing and that this is all part of NHS. Including my medication!
This is not something we have in Canada.

61,r_309246,Aj R,2,"My wife came into the A&E Monday with a bad cut from a fall. From being checked in, to waiting, to finally being seen and treated, the whole ordeal took about ten hours. To give them a little slack, they were busy, clearly shortstaffed, and we were informed that there is a strike of some kind going on; we're from the states so this wait time isn't uncommon to us, it'a just unfortunate that it was bad timing on our part. They treated us in the waiting room when her cut reopened, got into an exam room for a CT scan, and eventually stitched up in an actual room. It was a bit unfortunate that they told us to wait in the waiting room for discharge, but again... they were busy and short staffed, so I understand. The staff there were very nice to us and helped ease our anxiety on the whole situation, even though they were also dealing with other patients who were not so pleasant.

However... the follow up is why I'm inclined to write this review and give it a lower rating.

We were told to come back on Friday to ensure that my wife would be able to re-take her blood thinners in order to fly home on Sunday. We came back, and they were very confused as to why we were there because apparently we were supposed to get a telehealth call to follow up and not be charged for an in person visit. We were very grateful that they were doing that for us, but unfortunately... they never called us. We called them every few hours on Friday and Saturday and EVERY TIME we were given the runaround: doctors are too busy, doctors are changing, call back in about two hours, etc. We were even put on hold for almost an hour before it disconnected and no one had any idea we were on hold.

So we were put in a very hard scenario where we had to either continue to call and get ignored, or go to the hospital and be seen/charged for the visit for what would likely be a five minute conversation. We also told them the urgency of the situation as we were flying out Sunday, but it didn't seem to matter.

We thankfully ended up getting a hold of our actual doctor who was on call in the states and he gave us the medical advice we needed. We still have not received a call from the hospital and we fly out in about sixteen hours.

The past two days have been filled with so much anxiety and concern for absolutely no reason. All the doctor had to do was call us, ask a few questions, and give us their verdict. I would not have been opposed to doing an in-person visit in order to be sure, but we were reasuured that we would be getting a call and we never did.

I left whipps Cross after them also down categorising my serious life threatening pain and sent me back to a&e to stand up for another 10 or more hours which I had been doing for almost 28 hours already as I could not lie down the pain was so bad. Yesterday Saturday after leaving whipps Cross and returning home I had to call yet another ambulance to take me back in after serious projectile vomiting and still unable to sleep.
It turned out to be kidney stones.
Unacceptable behaviour by both hospitals putting my life at risk as a vulnerable adult alone with no family support.
How dare doctors from 2 separate hospitals gas light and somehow it ends with me apologising to them for being so upset when they were 100 percent responsible.

I’m genuinely shocked by the dismissive and unprofessional attitude of a triage nurse named Vicky at the A&E department. My brother arrived with a suspected blood clot (this is what the GP said) and shooting pain in the left arm, a serious medical concern. Without taking any observations — no blood pressure, temperature, oxygen levels — she immediately sent him to Urgent Care (Out of Hours GP). No explanation, no urgency, just a brisk redirection.

When I questioned her approach, she confidently gave her name as if she was doing something right. Meanwhile, intoxicated patients were sitting in the emergency waiting area, being treated as higher priority.

It raises real concerns about unconscious bias and the inconsistent application of triage protocols. A suspected blood clot should never be brushed off like this.

88,r_683647,Aiden,1,"On the 13/10/2021 my mother attended the RLH for day surgery to have a hiatus hernia repaired, she was in good health and suffered with no high risk factors other than her issues with the hernia. While in the hospitals care she contracted a virus/bug and this wasn’t picked up by them, she had to stay in over night due to her vitals being low. On the 14/10/2021in the early afternoon she was discharged and had to endure a long car journey home(over 40 miles as the consultant wouldn’t come to her local hospital which is where my mother should have gone)in discomfort. When she arrived back at home I was there to greet her and could see she was in a lot of pain. During a sleepless night she had sweating and complained about her breathing(which she told me over the phone while she was on the recovery ward that it was slightly shallow), these symptoms were taken as post surgery symptoms as the hospital gave no information on what to look out for, they also didn’t check her vitals before leaving the hospital, something I’m sure would have given an indication of her need for help.
In the early hours of the 15/10/2021 around 18 hours after surgery she asked me to help change her nighty, while I was helping her she displayed confusion and said she couldn’t breath and felt as if she was going to faint, I told her to lean on me and in a beat she collapsed on the floor, I had to struggle and give her cpr while calling for an ambulance. The ambulance crew and air ambulance service worked on her for an hour but sadly she could not be revived… after weeks of her being with the coroner they confirmed she had died of acute respiratory failure caused by bronchial pneumonia(from whatever virus/bug my mother picked up from the hospital which with her immune system being low accelerated into BP), this caused her lungs not able to provide her body with oxygen and her heart went into cardiac arrest from working/struggling too hard. The hospital investigation took almost a year with them holding back paperwork and ultimately, not accepting liability. Their paperwork showed she was ok to be discharged, this is something I believe was not right. The media continues to report on failings nationally where the NHS and Trusts(in this case Barts)have failed patients with many different conditions, I believe the NHS is sadly full of people inadequate of doing the job and providing the proper care so many need. But things are being covered up. I believe the RLH killed my mother and they should have accepted their failure, because she deserved better. If you are attending this hospital I pray you don’t end up getting the same poor standard of care my mother did, something that will stay with me for the rest of my life.

The NHS is broken and part of that, is certain people working within it.

Because of their irresponsible i admitted hospital to late. After going hospital doctor told me that in every two hour i would take 8 tablets for labour pain. Nurse did not give me medicine on time.I reminded them always that time for medicine.Finally when my pain as well as water break started they did not give me good service and i tolerated pain 12 hours in bed although they told me to prepare my self for delivery room.When i could not endure pain i told them for deliver but they did not give me importance and they told delivery room is not available.

I was booked for an induction two weeks past my due date as I was carrying an LGA baby. On the morning of my appointment, I called to confirm and was told they were running two days behind schedule and couldn’t see me. After being passed from one department to another with no clear answers, I finally contacted Homerton, who were incredible. The difference between Homerton and Royal London was stark—Homerton’s staff were kind, caring, and efficient, and I gave birth later that day. Despite a stressful morning trying to find somewhere to give birth, I’m glad it lead me to the Homerton. I felt safe and well cared for. They couldn’t believe I was allowed to go overdue with a big baby.

235,r_248761,Will Yeates,1,"I was appalled by the awful treatment patients received when visiting maternity triage in the evening of Thu 19 Sep. It feels like if this standard of care continues, a mother or baby are going to end up dead because of the neglect shown. We were encouraged to attend triage (6F) because we were worried about the baby’s lack of movement. No one was at reception when we arrived at 7.45pm. We waited half an hour to be checked in without any explanation of what was happening. Once checked in we went to the hospital station to give notes to a midwife but no one was there. We waited another 20minutes until we saw our first midwife and got to hand in our notes. After another period of waiting, we asked how long it would take to speak to someone about the baby not moving. We were told they didn’t know, and as they had only just come on duty, they didn’t know what was going on, or where the doctor was and were told to sit down. I feel we were spoken to better as a white couple, because I could see that when Bangladeshi couples went up to ask the same question, they were met with hostile responses to sit down.

After arriving for treatment, she was left waiting for an extended period without any updates. Only after she inquired herself did a nurse finally check on her status. Shockingly, this was followed by a loud argument among staff members, which we overheard. Disturbingly, the nurse in charge of my friend’s care was shouting, stating that she “doesn’t care” about my friend’s condition, even saying that “they should die for all she cares,” while placing blame on the doctor instead of addressing the situation professionally.

This behavior is not only highly unprofessional but also poses a serious risk to patient safety and well-being. The lack of accountability and communication demonstrated here is unacceptable and could potentially endanger lives. We believe that such staff members should not be employed within the NHS, as their conduct undermines the quality of care expected.

Rest - There's no appropriate rest areas for night shift workers. Have to sleep screwed up on a waiting room sofa in a family room or on rolled up bedrail covers in a cupboard.

Food - There's no affordable place to eat since they closed down the subway, never enough time to leave the ward to go across to the restaurant. Which also isn't affordable unless you get a jacket potato which are very limited.

Security/ID - The ID Suite (office to fix ID badges) has really inaccessible access hours. How can Monday - Thursday 07:30-15:00 serve the entire hospital????? When most of our 2nd breaks start 15:00. Then Friday is even worse 07:30-14:30 with them closing for break at 12:30-13:00.
It should be open a few minutes before our shift so we can not have our day interrupted without being able to get in places. E.g today I had 15 extra minutes before my shift but couldn't go to the office as it opened at 07:30, that means I can't get into the staff room to store my lunch and have to pester people to let me in all day. Why should I sacrifice my lunch break to go and join a queue?
Then waiting till the end of the shift is impossible as it's closed. It also closes for lunch for a long time. It really needs to be expanded to meet staff demand , it's way too small and not enough workers.

However, I was tested for severe allergies to 2 types of Local Anaesthetics, and the tests never made it to my records.

For 25 years I was challenged when I pointed out that I had these allergies. This happened often and comments like “You’re just afraid of needles” and “You are putting us to more expense” hurt, and were upsetting.

God knows what was written on the secret parts of my records ? But the way I was talked to indicated that I must have been written off as a hypochondriac.

This poor service culminated in me being given numerous injections of one of the dangerous local anaesthetics, and they won’t admit it or even retest me to try to find a newer safe alternative.

The RVI even wrote to my MP denying they used a local anaesthetic via extensive injections.

Under the care of neurology or on various wards I’ve been in I’m looked after quite well and some doctors are amazing! bar feeling like things are taking too long and I still haven’t been referred for some tests I was told I needed months back!. My medication was mixed up three times but I got an apology as this meant I was unable to drive or work. However i have slight trauma even thinking what happened to me in a&e. I was took in by ambulance and made to sit in a busy corridor full of people in beds waiting on a hard plastic chair for 13 hours due to overcrowding.(no one’s fault and some people needed more help than me).  I was begging for paracetamol and shaking with the pain after about 6 hours.

I was nervous, took my partner and was told on the phone that we would be entitled to Ronald McDonald housing for the time she was admitted because we had travelled so far (over 5 hours) and there was a possibility she’d need open heart surgery, I confirmed this multiple times.

The sister on the ward was extremely rude, told me “usually you’re just dropped off at the entrance we weren’t expecting both parents” in a rude way and snubbed her nose at me, even though I made them aware we were coming and CONFIRMED this. We were also told we were not entitled to any accommodation at all and to sleep in the car or pay for a hotel. She had absolutely no sympathy, Which is worrying considering she’s a children’s nurse. I was told by my daughters consultant that her procedure could result in open heart surgery so to prepare ourselves for a possible long stay (luckily she didn’t have to and it all went according to plan). I still think about this to this day, she made me feel like me being worried about my daughter was dramatic and I should have travelled 6 hours alone or been dropped off which is absolutely insane. Really wish I wrote her name down. She was an older lady, and manager/sister in PICU and the children’s wards. Hopefully she’s left, no one else should be made to feel the way I did.

I work in a hospital myself and would never ever dream about talking to a patient this way.

One of the worst experiences of patient care I have ever experienced. Morning rounds the ENT surgeons walk around at high speed with attitudes of sergeants in the marines, not the army, the marines!!! Just absolute robots!! No empathy, Zero beside manner, patients being left begging for a commode 4 times so they are able to access their basic human right of going to the toilet and keeping their dignity. Patients are shamed and made to feel like their pain is insignificant in the attitude that is displayed by staff. Different diagnosis made on same ward by 2 different surgeons and 2 different plans made so you don't know whether you're coming or going. I heard 2 others saying they were going to be making a complaint, sadly these were elderly people and so it is unlikely they will proceed with a complaint by the time they are better and out of there because they will want to see the back of it, but I really hope they do because otherwise if people do not raise this it will never change. My advice here will be for the staff to revisit and reflect on why they became Healthcare professionals in the first place, it may help to reignite some genuine human emotion!

16,r_846169,Ayyub Chowdhury,5,"Southmead Hospital really stands out in a good way. First thing you notice is how open and spacious it feels. It doesn’t give off that cramped, stressful vibe you sometimes get in hospitals. The design is modern, bright and clean, which makes the whole place feel a lot more welcoming.

The layout is easy to follow with clear signposts, so you don’t end up wandering around lost. On top of that, they have self check in machines right at the entrance which makes appointments so much quicker and stress free.

The staff are brilliant, friendly, helpful, and they actually take the time to make sure you’re comfortable and know what’s happening. You can also tell the hospital values its volunteers. They’ve got ""Move Makers"" who are dotted around helping people find their way. If you’re not sure where to go, they’ll literally walk with you and make sure you get to your appointment, which makes a massive difference.

On the practical side, having an M\&S and a Costa inside the hospital is a big bonus. It makes waiting around or visiting much easier, as you’ve got proper options for food and coffee instead of just a vending machine.

103,r_357815,The Pretty Soapery,1,"I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction with the care and handling of my late grandfather during his time at Southmead Hospital. Our experience has been distressing from start to finish, and I feel compelled to highlight the failures we encountered in the hope that no other family endures the same pain.

My grandfather was admitted due to some serious health concerns. He was discharged prematurely, only to be readmitted a few days later in what can only be described as a chaotic and disorganised manner. Upon his return, he was left waiting on an emergency ward for several days before being moved to palliative care. When I called to inquire about his location, I was merely told “Ward 9B.” At no point was it made clear to us that this was a palliative care ward - a lack of communication that added unnecessary confusion and emotional turmoil to an already difficult time.

A family member visited him on Tuesday, November 19th, and witnessed the neglect he was enduring. He was visibly uncomfortable and not being treated with the dignity and care he deserved. His food was placed out of reach, he was left in his own waste, and his skin was sore. Despite his requests for cream to ease the irritation on his arms, nurses refused, dismissing it as unhelpful. While the cream may not have cured his condition, it could have provided him some small measure of comfort in his final days. He was also approached by 3 different doctors there who told him it was 'the end of the road', this disregard for basic compassion is unacceptable.

On the day he passed away, we were fortunate to meet a nurse with blue hair (apologies for not recalling her name), who was a lovely kind and supportive lady. Her care in that moment was a small solace amid an otherwise harrowing experience.

Since his passing, the situation has only worsened. The hospital have held on to him for two weeks, rendering him unable to be dressed in the clothes our family had chosen for him. This is due to a certain doctor not showing up to planned meetings that would allow us to register his death and move on with the process. This is both shocking and heartbreaking, compounding our grief and leaving us feeling utterly devastated.

12,r_729273,Kelly Callus,1,"What has happened to our family is beyond appalling — it is a heartbreaking example of how catastrophically broken mental health care has become, and how badly vulnerable people are being failed by the very institutions meant to protect them.

A 19-year-old boy — vulnerable, frightened, and in crisis — was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. That should have triggered immediate, compassionate, specialist care. Instead, he was effectively abandoned.

For four days, he was confined to a small, windowless A&E room no bigger than a storage cupboard (2m x 2.5m). No proper bed. No therapeutic support. No structured care. Just left, day and night, in isolation — with his mental health spiralling further with every hour that passed. The environment was completely inappropriate for someone in acute psychological distress. It was inhumane.

Despite being sectioned — meaning he was deemed at serious risk to himself or others — there was no meaningful observation or safeguarding. The staff failed to monitor him adequately, and eventually allowed him to walk out, unsupervised, with no plan in place. Now he is missing — alone, vulnerable, and still in crisis. The hospital’s failure to act with even the most basic level of responsibility has placed him in real and immediate danger.

This was not just poor care. It was neglect. It was a total abdication of duty — both morally and legally. A young person in desperate need was treated as an inconvenience and left to deteriorate behind closed doors, while the hospital gave excuse after excuse: “We’re understaffed.” “The system is broken.” As if that justifies leaving a teenager to suffer without proper treatment — and then letting him vanish without protection.

There are no excuses for this level of failure. Vulnerable people are falling through the cracks in plain sight — and this hospital is allowing it to happen. Someone must be held accountable. There must be a serious investigation into this incident and the wider culture of neglect and inaction that enabled it.

I had the expectation I would be receiving a patch test to confirm and get some clarity on some allergies I suspect. I was referred to St George's and have waited approx 4 months for a dermatologist patch test appointment. I went out of my way, having to book a half day of leave for the inconvenient appointment time and travel to tooting. After checking in I was then told that the nurse did not have the right medication to go ahead with the appointment. I had no communication via the NHS app nor text or call or anything to inform me ahead of time that this appointment could not go ahead.

This is completely unacceptable and has me really enraged that I was also completely disregarded and my only option was to reschedule for THE HOSPITAL'S error. I have now been given another appointment in september. I am really sorry but this is just not okay at all. I do not want to have to wait another 4 months for an appointment I really need.

I am writing this complaint following an extremely disappointing experience I recently had at your facility. It was the first time I brought my son to this hospital, in an emergency situation, as he was experiencing chest pain and shortness of breath.

Unfortunately, instead of finding support, empathy, and professionalism, we were met with a careless attitude. The doctor on duty only checked his blood pressure and oxygen levels, without considering it necessary to perform an electrocardiogram or any other relevant investigations given the symptoms. After a conversation that lasted no more than two minutes, we were simply told that “everything is fine” and that we could go home. I had to insist, as a parent, for my son to at least be given an ECG.

Moreover, the staff in the paediatrics department appeared bored and uninterested, which further added to the feeling of insecurity during an already stressful moment.

I find it unacceptable that in a hospital — a place where we expect our children’s health to be treated with the utmost seriousness — we encountered a lack of involvement and medical assessments carried out in haste, with little to no communication.

The 20th of May of 2023 a young doctor saw me in  A&E, she was great. At that point I was tired of doctors diagnosing me by looking at my face (I was looking great! Yeah! But dying). She was the doctor that asked me to go back on Monday 22nd because my platelets were around 50000 and it was really worrying. I consider, that after 3 years suffering a cancer without knowing, she saved my life just with her concern. She wanted me going back to the hospital on Monday so an Hematologist could see me. To this doctor, thank you. So young and so professional, some can learn from you.

A different experience was the 22nd. When I said I was there on Saturday they looked at me as I was crazy. I told them the doctor left a note for them and they looked for it, I was right.I said I was not leaving until someone could say to me what was happening in my body. I had a doctor rolling the eyes on my, asking me silly questions but at that point I just wanted him to look at my massive spleen. They made me wait 8 hours. The doctor saw me twice and at some point he said “you deserve  I call to the Hematology Department to get an appointment for you”, I deserve… he said. He called (I am grateful for that) and the hematologist came immediately to see me. To this incompetent doctor, you are lucky I did not die. You should not be a doctor.

The hematologist started asking questions to me, I had another blood test (she made the incompetent doctor to do it, and he apologized), and in 30 minutes she told me I could have LEUKAEMIA or lymphoma. To this wonderful Hematologist, you definitely saved my life! (also my dignity) There is not a score for this.

I would love to know the name of the two female doctors that helped me to survive to thank them. Without them my spleen would have broken soon.

13,r_863671,Helen Light,1,"I am writing this after finally being diagnosed with stage 4 endometriosis in Italy, where I will now undergo surgery. Months of my life were wasted in unbearable pain because your hospital failed to identify the problem and instead misdiagnosed me with “appendix” or “renal colic.”

I came to your A&E around 9.30 PM in February 2025 and I left the day after at 11.45 AM (more than 12H!), with relentless, debilitating pain, clearly linked to my menstrual cycle, yet your doctors failed to listen, failed to investigate appropriately, and ultimately failed me as a patient.

Despite my repeated insistence that this was not flank pain, not renal colic, and not appendicitis, I was dismissed, misdiagnosed, and sent away with codeine and suppositories and other painkillers. I explicitly told Dr Simon Pearson that, due to my medical history of UTIs, I would be able to recognise kidney-related pain. A CT scan later confirmed that my kidneys were fine and my appendix was normal. Yet no further investigation was pursued. Instead, I was left in agony, forced to endure unnecessary scans, pointless medication, and most importantly, the loss of crucial months of my life.

I repeat, this way maybe you get to take this into consideration, I now have a confirmed diagnosis of stage 4 endometriosis. A diagnosis that your hospital failed to even consider, despite the obvious pattern of severe, period-related pain. This level of incompetence is not just unacceptable, it is dangerous. By dismissing patients and masking symptoms with painkillers rather than identifying the root cause, you are not treating people; you are prolonging their suffering and worsening their conditions. It is shocking that doctors rely on guesswork, online and AI searches instead of listening to patients and investigating thoroughly. You are not treating people,  you are experimenting on them and covering up your failures with pills. If someone presents with severe, cyclical pain during menstruation, endometriosis should at least be part of the discussion.

The negligence and incompetence I experienced here caused me unnecessary suffering, delays in diagnosis, and loss of quality of life. Patients deserve better than to be dismissed, misdiagnosed, and given pills as a quick fix.

100,r_285025,Nadia,2,"Most of my experience was fine (long wait times but that’s to be expected), the main reason I’m leaving this review is because of the HORRIBLE nurse who took my blood.

She first handled my urine sample (which was loose as they had run out of urine sample kits) and then proceeded to walk around restocking needles and typing on the keyboard with the same gloves she had used for my urine …

She then called me to take my blood (all while not having changed her gloves), when I asked her if she could please change them she told me she already had (she had not, I had been watching her the whole time). I then insisted she change them anyway.

Before taking my blood I informed her I have vasovagal and am prone to fainting and vomiting when having blood drawn or needles in my body in general. Usually, any reasonable medical practitioner would ask you to lie down after this, she did not. After struggling to find a vein for a while (I’ve never had any issues with people finding my veins by the way, I’ve actually been told I have “good veins” in the past - but that’s not relevant), she finally found one and proceeded to try to take my blood, then failed miserably by keeping the needle in my arm for a solid 4-5 minutes which caused me to faint and vomit. Throughout the process I told her that I was not feeling well, that I was nauseous and that I felt faint and she proceeded by telling me it was “just a few more seconds”. After I woke up from fainting and told her I was going to vomit she did absolutely nothing and it was a nurse from outside the room who came in running with a bowl for me to be sick in.

This was obviously very traumatic so I was crying, and whilst crying, after being sick and fainting she then asked me to take my own vomit and dispose of it in the toilet.

To top this whole fantastic experience off, when I saw the doctor he told me that the blood test didn’t work and so I had to retake it, so that was all for absolutely nothing (and I had to spend an additional 3 hours in A&E).

Don’t know what her name was but whoever is running the hospital needs to conduct a serious investigation.",11 months ago,1,12,en,St_James_University_Hospital,2024-12-10 19:37:39.274802,most of my experience was fine long wait times but that s to be expected the main reason i m leaving this review is because of the horrible nurse who took my blood she first handled my urine sample which was loose as they had run out of urine sample kits and then proceeded to walk around restocking needles and typing on the keyboard with the same gloves she had used for my urine she then called me to take my blood all while not having changed her gloves when i asked her if she could please change them she told me she already had she had not i had been watching her the whole time i then insisted she change them anyway before taking my blood i informed her i have vasovagal and am prone to fainting and vomiting when having blood drawn or needles in my body in general usually any reasonable medical practitioner would ask you to lie down after this she did not after struggling to find a vein for a while i ve never had any issues with people finding my veins by the way i ve actually been told i have good veins in the past but that s not relevant she finally found one and proceeded to try to take my blood then failed miserably by keeping the needle in my arm for a solid minutes which caused me to faint and vomit throughout the process i told her that i was not feeling well that i was nauseous and that i felt faint and she proceeded by telling me it was just a few more seconds after i woke up from fainting and told her i was going to vomit she did absolutely nothing and it was a nurse from outside the room who came in running with a bowl for me to be sick in this was obviously very traumatic so i was crying and whilst crying after being sick and fainting she then asked me to take my own vomit and dispose of it in the toilet to top this whole fantastic experience off when i saw the doctor he told me that the blood test didn t work and so i had to retake it so that was all for absolutely nothing and i had to spend an additional hours in a e don t know what her name was but whoever is running the hospital needs to conduct a serious investigation,"['experience', 'fine', 'long', 'wait', 'time', 'expected', 'main', 'reason', 'leaving', 'review', 'horrible', 'nurse', 'blood', 'first', 'handled', 'urine', 'sample', 'loose', 'run', 'urine', 'sample', 'kit', 'proceeded', 'walk', 'around', 'restocking', 'needle', 'typing', 'keyboard', 'glove', 'used', 'urine', 'called', 'take', 'blood', 'changed', 'glove', 'please', 'change', 'already', 'watching', 'whole', 'insisted', 'change', 'anyway', 'taking', 'blood', 'informed', 'vasovagal', 'prone', 'fainting', 'vomiting', 'blood', 'drawn', 'needle', 'body', 'general', 'usually', 'reasonable', 'medical', 'practitioner', 'ask', 'lie', 'struggling', 'find', 'vein', 'never', 'issue', 'people', 'finding', 'vein', 'actually', 'vein', 'past', 'relevant', 'finally', 'found', 'proceeded', 'try', 'take', 'blood', 'failed', 'miserably', 'keeping', 'needle', 'arm', 'solid', 'minute', 'caused', 'faint', 'vomit', 'throughout', 'process', 'feeling', 'nauseous', 'felt', 'faint', 'proceeded', 'telling', 'second', 'woke', 'fainting', 'going', 'vomit', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'nurse', 'outside', 'room', 'running', 'bowl', 'sick', 'obviously', 'traumatic', 'cry', 'whilst', 'cry', 'sick', 'fainting', 'take', 'vomit', 'dispose', 'toilet', 'top', 'whole', 'fantastic', 'experience', 'saw', 'blood', 'test', 'work', 'retake', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'spend', 'additional', 'hour', 'know', 'name', 'whoever', 'running', 'need', 'conduct', 'serious', 'investigation']",1,0.51117665

Waited about 25 minutes to get to the triage nurses.  My nurse was very nice and very thorough.  You then sit and wait for the admin people to call you over and to check your details are correct on their system.  Waited only two or three minutes for the next guy to call me over.  While waiting, overheard the first nurse on the phone notifying someone I needed to be seen urgently.  Admin guy called me over, again very nice and friendly, told me he would be quick because someone was waiting to take me 'through'.  Finished with him and another nurse appeared seconds later to to take me through to the bowels of A&E where I was on a bed in a pod in what seemed no more that 10 minutes of having spoken to the first nurse.

I was then attended to throughout my stay by a series of staff who, without exception provided outstanding care and consideration.  I don't know whether its even called customer service in a heathcare setting, but for want of a better phrase I will use that. Just exceptional customer service.

The staff were attentive, they all introduced themselves, explained who they were and what they would be going to do.  They all did it, so I'm guessing this is down to good training.

I'd been there before for a similar problem, so I had an idea about how the problem had been fixed previously.  I was able to discuss this and how the treatment would be approached this time, my views were taken on board.  I know this isn't always something that's possible, but it was good to know that the doctors were happy to listen and to take on board patient views.

Dear St Thomas’ and Guy’s Hospital Teams,

I am writing to express my deepest gratitude for the exceptional care I received during my recent visit. I initially went to the emergency department at St Thomas’ Hospital with severe kidney pain, where I was thoroughly examined and then transferred to Guy’s Hospital.

I regret that I cannot remember the names of everyone who helped me, but I want to extend my sincere thanks to each person involved in my care. From the cleaning staff to the nurses, nursing aides, medical assistants, and doctors, everyone was attentive, professional, and compassionate. I felt truly looked after and welcomed by all.

A special thanks goes to Katarina Spurna, who on my last day provided me with all the information I needed with patience and kindness. Her support meant a lot to me, and I am immensely grateful.

Thank you to the entire team at both St Thomas’ Hospital and Guy’s Hospital for your dedication and care. Your kindness made a difficult time much easier, and I will always be thankful for that.

Warmest regards,
[Rafael Donatão]

I recently had the pleasure of being treated by Dr. Emily Howell at St. Thomas Hospital, and I wanted to express my heartfelt gratitude for the exceptional care I received. After a previous visit two months ago due to kidney stones, I returned on January 1, 2025, experiencing pain and discomfort.

Dr. Emily Howell, who specializes in otolaryngology, was incredibly attentive and thorough in her approach. She conducted the necessary tests and clinical examinations with great care. She carefully examined my abdomen, checking for any abnormalities, and took the time to ensure I felt comfortable throughout the process.

What stood out most was Dr. Emily Howell’s kindness, patience, and genuine concern for my well-being. Her dedication to her patients is evident, and I truly appreciate the respect and compassion she showed me during my visit.

I am deeply thankful for professionals like Dr. Emily Howell, who go above and beyond to provide excellent care. We need more healthcare providers with such a strong commitment to their patients.

4,r_980146,Mundeep Gill,1,"I must caveat this regretful review with the fact this is not about the UCH Cancer Hospital, nor those who were tasked with my sadly now-deceased Mother's care prior to Monday 6 October, 2025.  This review is specifically about the horrendous neglect, negligence, dereliction of duty, and cruel treatment at the hands of the Head Nurse and another nurse (B.) during the day shift on Monday 6 October, on the 8th floor of the main hospital (T-8).

We had taken my Mum to UCLH's emergency care department on Thursday 2 October, 2025.  She was seen as a matter of urgency and it was discovered that she had dangerously low sodium levels.  She was treated with the utmost care, and her sodium levels recovered and the specialists were optimistic that she would be able to come home after around three to four days.

My Mum was then moved to the 8th floor, T-8, the respiratory ward, where she was cared for attentively and compassionately by dedicated nurses.  This very unfortunately changed for the very worst on Monday 6 October.  The Head Nurse and the nurse B. ignored my Mother when she was in pain, skipped her medicines or had administered them at the wrong time.  They ""forgot"" to administer vital anti-fungal treatment, which played a role in the development of the eventually-fatal infection which took my Mother's life. At dinner time, both the Head Nurse and B. were engaging in laughter and small talk with other patients whilst my Mum coughed blood and was crying in agony.  When I approached B. for assistance, she crudely remarked that my Mum is being cared for by a nurse on another ward and told me to wait.  That nurse, R., when he eventually turned up much later, was also dismissive, rude and arrogant.  That evening, I was told to go home, but I was very concerned for my Mum.  The nurse, R., dismissed me and said, roughly paraphrased: ""Your Mum is fine and you are welcome to sleep on the pavement outside the hospital if you are that concerned"".  One hour later, I'm informed that my Mum is being taken to Intensive Care/Critical Care and I rushed back to the hospital after taking the train home to Broxbourne.

Despicable treatment.  I'm so sorry that my Mum had to suffer at their hands during the last few days of her life.

On a more positive note, I wanted to thank the lovely gentleman Dr Papadatos-Pastos for the affection, conscientious care and optimism he injected into my dear Mother's life.  A wonderful, dedicated person who is an immense credit to his profession.  My Mother was so grateful to him.  Also, thank you to the UCLH staff who cared for my Mum prior to Monday 6 October, and to the Critical Care staff.  It's a damned and unforgivable shame that the Head Nurse, B. and R. on the day shift of Monday 6 October, 2025, were so utterly awful, neglectful, mean-spirited and cold towards my Mother, and had ignored their duties to my Mum whilst they were laughing with the other patients.  I will never forgive or forget.

19,r_207857,Mie Shy,1,"First of all, If I could 0 stars I would.

When I first arrived at the University College Hospital, I was already very stressed because my GP had called the hospital and referred me there, saying my toe might be broken. As soon as I entered, I was confused because the sign near the reception area said “Car Park,” so I wasn’t sure where exactly I should go. I was speaking with my partner to figure it out when a short-haired woman with brown hair — a staff member at the front desk — spoke to me in a very rude manner. She said something like, “So, are you going to register or what?” in a harsh tone.

Even though I was clearly in pain and shaking from stress, her behaviour didn’t change. When I explained that a doctor had referred me and called the hospital, instead of listening, she mocked me and laughed, saying, “What do you mean someone called you? So you came here because ‘someone’ called you?” I found this very humiliating and unprofessional, especially considering I was in distress and seeking urgent care.

So after this really bad reception experience,
I sat down and waited, still feeling extremely anxious and in pain. No one clearly explained what would happen next or how long I was supposed to wait. I had arrived around 8 PM, but I didn’t leave the hospital until almost 2 AM. Around 1 AM, I was finally called in. Despite clearly seeing that I couldn’t walk properly, no one offered me any help or even held my hand to support me. Everyone was just watching while I struggled to walk on my injured foot a distance that would normally take 5 seconds took me about 5 minutes. I found this absolutely unacceptable and extremely upsetting. When I finally reached the room, the doctor who had previously spoken to me on the phone for a long time and told me I would get an X-ray, looked at my foot and said, “Do you want an X-ray? Because I think it might be fractured.” I said yes, and he told me to wait outside again. I then had to walk all the way back to the waiting area again, completely unaided, limping and in pain, wearing only one shoe and one sock.

After about another 10–15 minutes of waiting, I was called for the X-ray. Once again, I had to walk there on my own. The X-ray was done, and I was told everything seemed normal. But again, nobody helped me on my way back — I had to walk all the way to the waiting room alone.

About 15 minutes later, the results came back, and I was called in one last time. I walked there by myself once more, and that’s when they finally told me that I actually had a hairline fracture in my toe.

The entire experience was exhausting, painful, and emotionally distressing. I cannot believe that a patient with a visible walking difficulty was made to move around repeatedly without any assistance for hours.

So basically, I had to wait for almost 8 hours, sitting there with a broken toe, and I wasn’t offered any kind of help or support during that entire time.",2 weeks

45,r_783582,C J,3,"My husband Devon started admission into UCLH and Hospital for Neurology from December 2024 and had a very rare illness that the doctors found very difficult to diagnose.  He was treated well sometimes and mistreated sometimes.

Some of the nurses, healtcare assistants and support workers,  mostly from African countries,  were nice and did the job out of passion while some were just about the money or opportunity and could not care less.

He was in and out of hospital and from April to July 2025, his condition worsened and so he had to remain in UCLH without any discharge from April to July.  Now that's a very long time to be in hospital.

He was on one on one and I want to commend the Good Healthcare Assistants like HCA Esther, HCA Kate from Neurology who sometimescame over to cover in UCLH, Support Worker Aziz and that Lovely Yoruba female Support Worker, I cant remember your name.  You guys really took care of Devon and made sure that he was ok and i really appreciate you all.  Thank you so much.

To the other good Nurses, Healthcare Assistants, Dieticians, Food Servers, Ward Managers & Managing Assistants and Doctors & Junior Doctors who made sure that Devon did not suffer, A special thanks to you all as well.

To the African Support Workers and Cleaners who thought that intimidating and humiliating Devon because he had no control over his bowels after the near death experience and had to wear pampers or sometimes could not help the accidents that he did on himself or shouted at him asking him why did he have the accident or forced him to clean it up by himself,  knowing his poor condition,  I hope that one day, you yourselves get to experience the same things that you put Devon through.

It was so inhumane, so cruel, so wicked to shout at a very ill man for doing a number 2 in his pampers because he could  not control his bowel or humiliating him to the point that he became so scared that he would quickly try to clean up the floor himself fearing that humiliation, even to the point that he passed out on the floor a few times.  He reported it, absolutely nothing was done about it.

You guys thought that Devon was in hospital too long and so after some time, you started mistreating him.  With the exception of the few that were mentioned before.  You all wanted him out at any cost and made his life miserable......this is a very ill man who had a very active life before becoming ill, was never lazy.  I wonder where your conscience are.  Do you guys not have father's, brothers, uncles, husbands?

UCLH is one of the best hospitals in London,  I do agree.  However,  with just a few horrible staff that has no passion for the job and just there for opportunity or money, the standards of the hospital will go very low very quickly.

If you dont have a passion for caring, you cannot care for another.  I know this as I myself,  I'm also in the health sector.  Alot of you are inhumane and because of your background,  despite this is UK, where things are done differently,  some of you still carry this bad background with you even here in UK and it's so bad.

If someone is ill, that person should be made to feel better and not worse, not intimidated or humiliated when you are being paid to do the job.  Why are you there if you don't like it?

47,r_587918,Falankuk (Falankuk),1,"Autonomic Unit (UCLH):

For three decades, I've been consistently denied access to the NHS despite suffering from a severe and rare degenerative disorder that triggers cardiac arrest. Initially evaluated by an expert Prof Christopher Mathias at the Autonomic Unit in University College London Hospital (UCLH) back in 1996, a critical misdiagnosis prevented me from being referred to other consultants. Consequently, despite residing permanently in the UK, I've had to seek healthcare abroad. This disorder necessitates a specialised treatment available at the UCLH's (Autonomic Unit), a treatment administered to other patients but inexplicably withheld from me, a clear case of discrimination.

For 25 years, I've been importing and using this treatment as prescribed by other consultants, yet my rightful access to it via the NHS has been consistently denied. Despite raising a complaint with the Parliament Health and Social Ombudsman (PHSO), it was summarily dismissed following extensive email correspondence. I also sought assistance from my local MP, Zarah Sultana, who regrettably chose to ignore my pleas even a request to bring attention to my case in Parliament was disregarded.

The PHSO's actions unmistakably shielded UCLH, masking their failures with a litany of falsehoods and perjury, all in violation of my human and patient rights. Their consistent downplaying of the severity of my situation further compounds the issue. Over 30 years, I've been unjustly denied critical NHS treatment, revealing the PHSO's shortcomings in legality, flexibility, transparency, fairness, and accountability. Their bias in favour of the NHS, working to conceal its errors, is evident and disappointing.

It's a disgraceful display from an organization expected to champion patient rights and stand against the abuse and neglect perpetrated by the NHS.

Consequently, they ban the presence of any patients’ relatives there, in my mother’s case this results in a very elderly, almost deaf and cognitively confused person with heart failure being left alone in a frightening environment, cruel in the extreme and counterproductive as fear and stress result in worse outcomes. It is shameful that there is no option for such patients to be accompanied by a carer/relative.
During the 8 hours that she was waiting there, first she then I approached the staff to enquire when she would be seen following her scan. Long story short, they give you literally the same meaningless answer to fob you off (‘about an hour and a half’) and by the end of those hours it is revealed how meaningless those dismissals are, not borne of real feedback from the relevant departments but just designed to get rid of you – one nurse literally rolled her eyes at her mother. Meanwhile another four hours pass and whenever one addresses the staff, even to request a spartan tray of food they simply stonewall you or give you a variation of the abovementioned dismissal.
Apart from these A&E visits, on two separate occasions earlier this year when my mother was an inpatient, we had encounters with two shockingly rude and incompetent nurses.
There’s a lot of signage at the hospital about ‘kindness’ and talk in general of abuse towards NHS staff and, while obviously that is inexcusable, the NHS urgently need to examine their own behaviour and the damage and alienation of patients they are causing.

74,r_377322,Yoannnnaa,5,"For anyone having to go through the muchly feared gastroscopy and colonoscopy (on the same day), go to UCLH Euston Road hospital and you´ll be in good, safe and painless hands. I was scared to have these procedures done in my 30s - I was scared of the procedure itself but also for the results. I asked from some of the staff beforehand if they had gone through the procedures themselves so I could get honest opinions on what to expect (didn´t quite buy to my British friends repeatedly saying ""you´ll be fine""). I asked about the different types of sedatives and numbing options and with the level of anxiety and fears I had beforehand I think moderate sedation was the perfect choice for me. I needed my body to be calm because I couldn´t calm it down the way that I would have wanted to. If I only had gastroscopy I think the numbing spray would have done it as it is SUPER EFFECTIVE but again with the level of my anxiety I am glad I chose sedation because I did not even realise that it was done. After I was given the mouth guard, the sedation was injected and the next thing I heard was ""that´s gastroscopy done"" and I was like really? And from the papers I can see it only took 3 minutes. So honestly it was nothing!
The colonoscopy was a bit more challenging BUT just because I had adhesions (which none of us could have known beforehand) - I remember two points where the pain was like a sudden pinch inside me but they got me talking about Lapland and northern lights and soon I was out of it all even realising what they were doing. At one point I even opened my eyes to look at the monitor and realised the room was dark and it was all pretty calming. So yes I was aware but no I could not feel much and I am honestly, positively surprised about how easy the whole thing was. The colonoscopy itself had lasted 16min for me and I was in the recovery before I even noticed.
The staff was super lovely and they were gentle like they had promised to. Choose sedation if you´re scared and rest assured the prep is a lot harder than the procedure itself!

I had an MRI scan that showed the problem. It was explained clearly and considerately by Dr Schueler.
There was a long wait, (only 15 minutes for triage) about 3 hours till I saw Dr Dixon - then the scan and diagnosis took my whole visit to about 6 hours.
BUT ! - it's an A&E department in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the world. Of course it's busy. They have more patients in need than staff to help them. The underfunding and attempted dismantlement of this beautiful service by previous governments is the cause of that. The doctors, porters, reception staff, everyone who actually works there did a brilliant job. They are amazing people.
And if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit in A&E here or anywhere, waiting in pain, it's not their fault.
I watched as I waited and I saw dozens of people doing their jobs, calmly, and as quickly as possible without ever stopping.
They are doing and giving the very best they can under a relentless pressure that's not of their making. Day after day, year after year.

I was never asked about any medical history or allergies. I had told him that in addition to my allergy concerns I was having excruciating ear pain and that I have a history of eustachian tube dysfunction and had multiple ear surgeries as a child.

He completely brushed over all my allergy concerns and then left after speaking to me for all of about two minutes.

I questioned this and told her I was waiting for results and the dr. She then proceeded to tell me I wasn’t waiting for testing results, no meds, no nothing? the nurse was done with me and I was to go to see GP - I proceeded to thank the the Dr that treated me and left the hospital, still having serious chest pains and unable to speak properly. I was scared and angry and all I could think of was getting home.

MyChart then sent a notification saying that I had ‘Walked Out’ ~ what an absolute joke!!  I was told to leave and see my GP! 🤯 the Dr that declared I had ’walked out’ was the same one I thanked…  his name was Agron Galicia how can u acknowledge a thank you while someone’s leaving and not stop them when they are clearly distressed and in pain??? What sort of Professional person treats someone like that - disgusting NEVER AGAIN

Had the misfortune of having to visit this hospital a number of times in the last year or so and with each visit I wish I never bothered. One time I was laying on the floor in a&e for 14hrs - one A&E nurse looked down at me ‘alright down there are we?? Laughed and walked off .. never to be seen again - I was waiting for an MRI 😒
