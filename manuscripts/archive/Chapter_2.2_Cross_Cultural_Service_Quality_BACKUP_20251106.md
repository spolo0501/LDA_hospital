# 2.2 Cross-Cultural Differences in Service Quality Perceptions

While Section 2.1 established that service quality is multidimensional and context-dependent, an additional layer of complexity emerges when comparing service quality across countries: culture shapes what customers expect, value, and evaluate in service encounters (Donthu and Yoo, 1998; Furrer et al., 2000). This section reviews the theoretical foundations of cross-cultural service quality research and develops expectations for how Taiwanese and American patients may differ in their hospital service quality perceptions.

## 2.2.1 Cultural Dimensions and Service Quality Expectations

### Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions Framework

The most widely applied framework for understanding cross-cultural differences in consumer behavior is Hofstede's (1980, 2001) cultural dimensions theory. Based on survey data from over 100,000 IBM employees across 76 countries, Hofstede identified six fundamental dimensions along which national cultures vary. These dimensions have proven particularly valuable in healthcare settings, where cultural values profoundly shape patient expectations, communication patterns, and satisfaction judgments (Shepherd et al., 2019; Majda et al., 2021).

Power distance reflects the extent to which less powerful members of a society accept and expect unequal power distribution (Hofstede, 2001). Taiwan's moderate-high power distance (PDI=58) compared to the United States' moderate-low score (PDI=40) suggests systematic differences in how patients relate to healthcare providers. In higher power-distance cultures, patients typically view physicians as authority figures whose decisions should not be questioned, expecting paternalistic care where doctors make decisions "for the patient's good" (Mead and Bower, 2000). Conversely, in lower power-distance cultures like the United States, patients expect shared decision-making processes where physicians explain options and patients actively participate in treatment choices (Charles et al., 1997).

The dimension of individualism versus collectivism measures the degree to which people prioritize personal goals over group goals (Hofstede, 2001). The stark contrast between Taiwan (IDV=17, highly collectivist) and the United States (IDV=91, highly individualist) represents perhaps the most consequential cultural difference for healthcare service quality. In collectivist cultures, family involvement in medical decisions is not only expected but valued, and excluding family members may be perceived as disrespectful (Blackhall et al., 1995; Singh et al., 2020). Collectivist patients may also prioritize relational harmony with healthcare providers, avoiding confrontation even when dissatisfied (Kim et al., 2002). In contrast, individualist cultures emphasize personal autonomy, with patients potentially resisting family interference as privacy and individual rights take paramount importance (Hofstede, 2001).

Uncertainty avoidance reflects the extent to which people feel threatened by ambiguous situations and create beliefs and institutions to avoid them (Hofstede, 2001). Taiwan's moderate-high score (UAI=69) relative to the United States (UAI=46) suggests that Taiwanese patients may demand more detailed explanations, thorough testing, and clear prognoses to reduce medical uncertainty (Donthu and Yoo, 1998). They may prefer comprehensive examinations over "wait and see" approaches, while American patients may be more comfortable with probabilistic diagnoses and less insistent on definitive answers.

The remaining dimensions provide additional nuance. Taiwan's moderate-feminine orientation (MAS=45) compared to the United States' moderate-masculine profile (MAS=62) suggests Taiwanese patients may place relatively greater emphasis on empathy, caring, and interpersonal warmth in healthcare encounters, while American patients may prioritize efficiency, technical competence, and results, potentially tolerating brusque communication if outcomes are satisfactory (Furrer et al., 2000). The dramatic difference in long-term orientation—Taiwan's very high score (LTO=93) versus the United States' low score (LTO=26)—implies that Taiwanese patients may emphasize preventive care and chronic disease management more than Americans, who may focus more on immediate symptom relief. Finally, the United States' higher indulgence score (IND=68) compared to Taiwan's moderate score (IND=49) suggests Americans may have higher expectations for comfort, convenience, and patient amenities.

**Table 2.1: Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions for Taiwan and United States**

| Dimension | Taiwan | United States | Interpretation |
|-----------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Power Distance | 58 | 40 | Taiwan more accepting of hierarchy; U.S. more egalitarian |
| Individualism | 17 | 91 | Taiwan highly collectivist; U.S. highly individualist |
| Uncertainty Avoidance | 69 | 46 | Taiwan prefers clarity/structure; U.S. tolerates ambiguity |
| Masculinity | 45 | 62 | Taiwan more caring-oriented; U.S. more achievement-oriented |
| Long-Term Orientation | 93 | 26 | Taiwan future-focused; U.S. present-focused |
| Indulgence | 49 | 68 | Taiwan moderate; U.S. more indulgent |

*Source: Hofstede Insights (2023)*

The most pronounced differences occur in individualism (74-point gap) and long-term orientation (67-point gap), suggesting these dimensions may most strongly differentiate service quality priorities between Taiwanese and American hospital patients.

## 2.2.2 Cross-Cultural Service Quality Research in Healthcare

### The Evolution of Cultural Competence in Healthcare

Recent research has increasingly recognized that effective cross-cultural healthcare extends beyond simple awareness of cultural differences to encompass cultural competence, cultural intelligence, and cultural safety (Shepherd et al., 2019; Majda et al., 2021). Shepherd and colleagues' (2019) qualitative study of healthcare providers revealed significant challenges in translating cultural competence training into daily practice. Healthcare professionals acknowledged the importance of cultural awareness but struggled with how to operationalize it when faced with diverse patient populations, time constraints, and institutional pressures. This gap between conceptual understanding and practical application highlights why measuring patient-reported service quality across cultures remains methodologically challenging.

Majda et al. (2021) demonstrated that cultural competence and cultural intelligence among emergency medical services personnel significantly affect the quality of care provided to culturally diverse patients. Their study of healthcare professionals in Poland found that higher cultural intelligence scores correlated with better patient outcomes and higher satisfaction ratings, even when controlling for clinical expertise. This finding underscores that technical medical competence alone cannot ensure quality healthcare in multicultural contexts; providers must also possess the cultural sensitivity to adapt their communication and care delivery to patients' cultural frameworks.

### Compassion and Empathy Across Cultural Boundaries

The role of compassion in healthcare quality has emerged as a particularly culturally contingent construct. Singh et al. (2020) conducted an in-depth examination of South Asian patients' perceptions and experiences of compassion in Western healthcare settings. They found that South Asian patients conceptualized compassion differently than their Western counterparts, emphasizing relational continuity, family involvement, and implicit understanding over explicit communication. When healthcare providers failed to recognize these culturally specific compassion cues, South Asian patients reported feeling uncared for despite technically competent medical treatment. This research highlights how service quality dimensions that might seem universal—such as "empathy" or "caring"—manifest quite differently across cultural groups.

The cultural specificity of interpersonal service quality extends to gender dynamics in care delivery. Vatandost et al. (2020) explored the challenges male nurses face when caring for female patients in Iran, a context where gender separation norms conflict with professional care requirements. Their findings reveal how cultural values surrounding modesty and gender interaction create unique service quality challenges absent in less gender-segregated cultures. Male nurses reported feeling that their technical competence was less valued than their ability to navigate cultural expectations, suggesting that "quality care" in this context required cultural conformity as much as clinical skill.

### Cultural Dimensions and Service Quality Expectations: Empirical Evidence

Building on Hofstede's theoretical framework, empirical research has tested whether service quality dimensions and their relative importance systematically vary across cultures. Furrer, Liu, and Sudharshan's (2000) landmark study examined SERVQUAL across 17 countries with varying Hofstede scores, finding that dimension importance varied significantly according to cultural values. Collectivist cultures rated empathy as the most important dimension (mean importance weight = 0.35), while individualist cultures prioritized reliability (0.32). High power-distance cultures assigned significantly higher importance to assurance—the competence and credibility of service providers (0.28 versus 0.21 in low power-distance cultures). These patterns emerged with remarkable consistency: individualism negatively correlated with empathy importance (r = -0.64, p < 0.01), power distance positively correlated with assurance importance (r = 0.52, p < 0.01), and uncertainty avoidance positively correlated with reliability importance (r = 0.48, p < 0.05).

Given Taiwan's collectivism (IDV=17) and the United States' individualism (IDV=91), Furrer et al.'s findings suggest that Taiwanese patients should weigh interpersonal and empathy dimensions more heavily, while American patients should emphasize reliability and outcomes. Donthu and Yoo (1998) corroborated these patterns in banking and retail services across Asian and Western countries, finding that high power-distance consumers expected more personalized service and status recognition, high uncertainty-avoidance consumers demanded greater standardization and detailed information, and collectivist consumers placed more value on relational continuity and harmonious interactions.

Comparative studies focusing specifically on healthcare services have revealed additional cultural variations. Winsted (1997) compared service encounter expectations between American and Japanese consumers, finding that Japanese consumers (collectivist, high power distance) emphasized concern and empathy (32% of critical incidents versus 18% for Americans) and formality and politeness (28% versus 12%), while American consumers emphasized promptness (35% versus 19% for Japanese) and personalization (22% versus 8%). Similarly, Mattila (1999) found that Asian hotel guests rated interpersonal service quality as significantly more important than Western guests (mean importance: 4.8 versus 4.2 on a 5-point scale, p < 0.01), while Western guests rated tangibles—physical facilities and equipment—higher (4.6 versus 4.1, p < 0.01).

### Healthcare-Specific Cross-Cultural Research

Healthcare-specific cross-cultural studies have identified service quality dimensions that emerge uniquely in particular cultural contexts. Andaleeb (2001) studied service quality in Bangladeshi hospitals—a collectivist, high power-distance culture similar to Taiwan—and identified nine dimensions including "responsiveness to family" as a distinct factor separate from responsiveness to patients. This dimension, which did not emerge in Western studies, reflects collectivist values where family involvement in healthcare decisions is normative and expected. Notably, "responsiveness to family" explained more variance in overall satisfaction than several clinically focused dimensions, suggesting that family accommodation represents a core quality expectation in collectivist healthcare contexts.

Choi et al. (2004) examined service quality in South Korean hospitals (another collectivist, high power-distance setting) and found that interpersonal trust emerged as a discrete dimension distinct from SERVQUAL's five-factor structure. This "interpersonal trust" dimension included items such as "I can trust this hospital's medical staff" and "The staff make me feel safe," suggesting that in high power-distance cultures, trust-building constitutes a separate quality dimension rather than being subsumed under "assurance" as in Western models. The salience of trust as a distinct dimension may reflect the greater reliance on physician authority in high power-distance cultures, where patients cede more decision-making control and therefore require stronger confidence in providers' benevolence.

Kim et al. (2002) examined physician-patient communication preferences, finding that 68% of Korean patients preferred physicians to make treatment decisions with minimal patient input, 72% wanted family members present during consultations, and 45% would not question a doctor's recommendation even if confused. In contrast, 81% of American patients wanted to participate actively in treatment decisions, only 34% wanted family present (and only if the patient requested it), and 92% felt comfortable asking clarifying questions. These stark differences in communication preferences have direct implications for service quality measurement: what constitutes "good communication" in a high power-distance, collectivist culture (physician-directed, family-inclusive) may be perceived as paternalistic or intrusive in a low power-distance, individualist culture.

### Cultural Challenges in Service Quality Measurement

A critical methodological issue in cross-cultural service quality research concerns measurement equivalence: whether the same instrument can validly measure the same construct across cultures (Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998). Four types of equivalence must be established. Construct equivalence asks whether the latent construct (e.g., "service quality") has the same meaning across cultures; evidence suggests partial equivalence, with service quality universally relating to satisfaction but varying in dimensional structure (Furrer et al., 2000). Item equivalence concerns whether scale items carry identical meanings; for instance, "The doctor respects my autonomy" assumes autonomy is valued, which holds in the United States but less so in Taiwan (Blackhall et al., 1995). Scalar equivalence addresses whether respondents use rating scales similarly; research has documented acquiescence bias (higher agreement rates in collectivist cultures) and extreme response bias (individualist cultures using endpoints more frequently, collectivist cultures clustering toward midpoints) (Chen et al., 1995). Finally, measurement unit equivalence concerns whether scale intervals have equal psychological distances across cultures, as cultural differences in interpreting gradations (e.g., "good" versus "very good") complicate direct score comparisons.

Traditional cross-cultural service quality research using standardized surveys like SERVQUAL faces validity threats if these equivalences remain unestablished. Researchers typically address these concerns through back-translation and cognitive interviews to ensure item equivalence (Donthu and Yoo, 1998), multi-group confirmatory factor analysis to test for measurement invariance (Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998), and adjustments for response style biases (Fischer, 2004). However, these methodological safeguards cannot fully eliminate cultural bias when using predetermined survey instruments developed in Western contexts.

The current study's text-mining approach partially mitigates these measurement equivalence challenges. By allowing service quality dimensions to emerge inductively from patients' own words rather than imposing predetermined constructs, we avoid construct equivalence assumptions. Without survey items, we sidestep item equivalence issues. Open-ended narratives eliminate response style biases associated with Likert scales. However, language differences between Chinese and English reviews still require careful translation and semantic alignment when comparing emergent topics across the two countries.

## 2.2.3 Hypothesized Cross-Cultural Differences: Taiwan vs. United States

Integrating Hofstede's cultural dimensions framework with empirical cross-cultural service quality research, we develop specific expectations for how Taiwanese and American hospital service quality dimensions may differ.

**Hypothesis 1: Interpersonal Quality Prominence**

Taiwan's collectivism (IDV=17) and moderate femininity (MAS=45) predict that interpersonal quality dimensions—including staff attitude, empathy, and communication warmth—will account for a larger proportion of service quality concerns in Taiwanese reviews compared to American reviews (Furrer et al., 2000; Mattila, 1999; Singh et al., 2020). Collectivist cultures' emphasis on relational harmony and feminine cultures' prioritization of caring should amplify the importance of interpersonal dimensions relative to technical or efficiency dimensions.

**Hypothesis 2: Family Involvement**

A distinct family-related dimension (family communication, family accommodation, family presence during care) will emerge in Taiwanese data but not in American data. Collectivist healthcare cultures expect and value family involvement in care decisions and hospital visits (Andaleeb, 2001; Kim et al., 2002), while American individualism (IDV=91) emphasizes patient privacy and autonomous decision-making. The absence of family-related service quality dimensions in Western SERVQUAL-based studies (Parasuraman et al., 1988) supports this expectation.

**Hypothesis 3: Physician Authority and Shared Decision-Making**

American reviews will more frequently discuss shared decision-making, patient autonomy, and questioning physician recommendations, while Taiwanese reviews will reflect acceptance of physician authority and paternalistic care. This expectation follows from the United States' low power distance (PDI=40) versus Taiwan's moderate-high power distance (PDI=58), which shapes different expectations for physician-patient power dynamics (Blackhall et al., 1995; Mead and Bower, 2000; Kim et al., 2002).

**Hypothesis 4: Efficiency and Wait Times**

American reviews will exhibit greater concern with wait times, appointment availability, and service efficiency compared to Taiwanese reviews. The United States' short-term orientation (LTO=26) and individualist emphasis on personal time efficiency (Winsted, 1997) contrast with Taiwan's long-term orientation (LTO=93) and collectivist tolerance for delays perceived as ensuring thoroughness.

**Hypothesis 5: Technical Competence Assessment**

American reviews will more explicitly discuss clinical outcomes, treatment effectiveness, and evidence-based medicine, while Taiwanese reviews will emphasize physician credentials, hospital reputation, and proxy indicators of competence. Although information asymmetry affects all patients, individualist cultures prioritize outcomes over process (Donthu and Yoo, 1998), while high power-distance cultures rely more heavily on authority signals—credentials, titles, institutional prestige—as quality proxies (Hofstede, 2001).

**Hypothesis 6: Emotional Expression and Communication Style**

Taiwanese reviews will employ more indirect language and hedging when expressing dissatisfaction, while American reviews will use more direct, explicit criticism. This expectation derives from high-context communication norms in Taiwan versus low-context norms in the United States (Hall, 1976), as well as collectivist cultures' tendency to avoid confrontation to preserve relational harmony (Kim et al., 2002).

Despite these expected differences, certain dimensions should appear in both countries due to universal healthcare service characteristics. The core medical encounter (diagnosis, examination, treatment explanation) is fundamental to healthcare globally. Basic physical environment factors (hygiene, facility conditions, equipment modernity) relate to health safety universally, though their relative importance may vary. Administrative processes (registration, payment, appointment scheduling) are necessary components of healthcare delivery in any system, though specific pain points may differ due to insurance-based versus universal coverage systems.

---

## 2.2.4 Institutional Context: Healthcare Systems and Service Quality

While cultural values shape service quality expectations, institutional structures—how healthcare is organized, financed, and delivered—also profoundly influence patient priorities (Scott, 2008). Taiwan and the United States represent fundamentally different healthcare system models: Taiwan's National Health Insurance provides universal single-payer coverage, while the United States relies on a predominantly market-based, multi-payer system with incomplete coverage. These institutional differences may moderate or amplify cultural effects on service quality perceptions.

This institutional context will be detailed in Section 2.3, which compares Taiwan's National Health Insurance system with the United States' market-based model and develops expectations for how these systemic differences manifest in patient reviews.

## Summary: Cross-Cultural Foundations for Taiwan-U.S. Comparison

This section establishes that culture shapes service quality priorities in healthcare. Collectivist, high power-distance cultures like Taiwan emphasize interpersonal warmth, family involvement, and relational harmony, while individualist, low power-distance cultures like the United States prioritize patient autonomy, efficiency, and clinical outcomes (Furrer et al., 2000; Donthu and Yoo, 1998; Shepherd et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2020). Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates that the number, nature, and relative importance of service quality dimensions vary with cultural values (Andaleeb, 2001; Choi et al., 2004; Winsted, 1997; Majda et al., 2021).

Traditional survey-based cross-cultural research faces measurement equivalence challenges concerning construct, item, and scalar equivalence (Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998)—challenges that our inductive, text-mining approach partially mitigates. Six specific hypotheses guide our empirical comparison, predicting differences in interpersonal quality prominence, family involvement, power dynamics, efficiency concerns, competence assessment, and communication directness. Beyond culture, healthcare system structures (universal versus market-based) shape patient experiences and priorities, which Section 2.3 addresses.

These theoretical foundations inform our LDA analysis strategy: rather than imposing identical dimensional structures on both countries (which would assume cultural invariance), we inductively discover dimensions in each dataset, then systematically compare emergent structures to test whether cultural and institutional differences produce divergent service quality frameworks.
