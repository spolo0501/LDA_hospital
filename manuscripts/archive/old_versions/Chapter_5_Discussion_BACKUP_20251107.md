# Chapter 5: Discussion and Conclusions

This study addressed three fundamental questions about healthcare service quality across different healthcare systems: What service quality dimensions emerge from patient discourse in Taiwan versus the United States? Which dimensions represent universal concerns transcending system structures, and which are system-specific or culture-specific? How does healthcare system structure influence the composition and relative importance of patient satisfaction determinants? Through systematic application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling to 5,007 Taiwan and 3,240 U.S. patient reviews, followed by cross-lingual semantic mapping and statistical hypothesis testing, we identified both universal dimensions (emergency care, professional/nursing care, outpatient services, inpatient care) accounting for approximately 78% of patient discourse, and system-specific dimensions (Taiwan: service attitude issues, facility environment quality; USA: billing/insurance issues, overall positive experience) accounting for approximately 22% of discourse. Critically, we found that while core quality concerns appear across both countries, healthcare system structure fundamentally shapes which dimensions achieve salience, how they are evaluated, and what administrative burdens patients experience.

This chapter discusses the theoretical implications of these findings for service quality theory and cross-cultural healthcare research, practical implications for hospital administrators and health policymakers, methodological contributions to cross-lingual topic modeling applications, and study limitations. We conclude with a synthesis of our contributions and their implications for understanding healthcare service quality across institutional and cultural boundaries.

## Theoretical Implications

Our findings make four significant contributions to service quality theory and healthcare quality research, each advancing understanding of how universal quality frameworks interact with institutional and cultural contexts.

### The Hybrid Nature of Service Quality Dimensions

Service quality theory has long debated whether quality dimensions are universal constructs applicable across cultures and contexts (etic perspective) or culturally contingent constructs requiring local adaptation (emic perspective) (Brady & Cronin, 2001). Our findings support a hybrid theoretical model: certain service quality dimensions operate universally, appearing in patient discourse regardless of healthcare system structure or cultural context, while other dimensions emerge uniquely from specific institutional arrangements or cultural values. The four universal dimensions we identified—emergency care, professional/nursing care, outpatient services, and inpatient care—collectively account for 78% of patient reviews in both countries, suggesting these represent fundamental, pan-cultural healthcare concerns. Emergency care alone constitutes the single largest dimension in both Taiwan (30.9%) and the United States (34.8%), indicating that emergency department crowding, wait times, and service quality represent a universal structural challenge transcending system boundaries.

However, the specific dimensional structure requires substantial institutional and cultural contextualization. Taiwan's service attitude issues dimension (17.3% of reviews, 1.69 stars) emerged as the third-largest dimension with the lowest satisfaction rating after emergency care, yet no equivalent standalone dimension appeared in U.S. data. This presence-versus-absence pattern provides compelling evidence that cultural values—specifically, collectivism's emphasis on interpersonal harmony and high power distance's expectations for respectful treatment—shape which service aspects coalesce into distinct quality dimensions. When Taiwanese patients encounter perceived rudeness, impatience, or disrespect from healthcare workers, they experience this as a fundamental service failure warranting separate dimension status. American patients, operating within lower power distance culture with greater tolerance for directness and informality, do not elevate interpersonal demeanor to dimension-level salience, instead incorporating such concerns within broader nursing care quality or general service evaluations.

Similarly, the United States' billing and insurance issues dimension (4.1% of reviews, 2.92 stars) represents an institutional extension of service quality theory that appears nowhere in Taiwan's seven-topic structure. Multi-payer healthcare systems create an entire dimension of patient dissatisfaction—surprise medical bills, insurance coverage denials, billing errors, prior authorization delays—that single-payer systems eliminate by design. Even at America's top-ranked hospitals, 4.1% of patient discourse centers exclusively on financial and administrative burdens created by system structure, independent of clinical care quality. This pattern supports our concept of "system tax": multi-payer systems impose measurable satisfaction penalties that single-payer systems avoid through standardized pricing and universal coverage.

These findings reconcile the apparent tension in service quality literature between universal frameworks (Parasuraman et al., 1988) and culturally-contingent theories (Donthu & Yoo, 1998). Service quality is indeed multi-dimensional across contexts—patients everywhere care about medical professionalism, emergency care, and administrative processes—demonstrating universality of core concerns. However, which specific dimensions emerge as salient, how they are labeled and evaluated, and what relative weight they carry in overall satisfaction judgments vary systematically with institutional structures and cultural values, demonstrating contingency. Future service quality research should abandon the false dichotomy between universal and contingent perspectives, instead developing hybrid models that specify which aspects of quality operate universally and which require contextualization.

### Institutional Effects Dominate Dimensional Composition

While both institutional structure and cultural values influence service quality perceptions, our findings demonstrate that institutional effects exert more powerful influence on dimensional composition—which dimensions emerge as distinct topics in patient discourse—than cultural effects. The strongest empirical evidence comes from presence-versus-absence comparisons: the billing/insurance dimension appears in U.S. data but is entirely absent from Taiwan's structure, the service attitude dimension appears as a standalone Taiwan topic but not as a distinct U.S. dimension. These presence-versus-absence patterns reflect institutional and cultural design features rather than random variation or measurement artifacts.

Institutional isomorphism theory (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983) predicts that organizations operating within the same institutional environment develop similar structures, practices, and concerns. Our findings extend this logic to patient quality perceptions: patients navigating the same healthcare system structure develop similar dimensional frameworks for evaluating quality, as system structure creates shared experiences, challenges, and pain points. Taiwan's single-payer NHI system generates universal coverage with standardized fee schedules, eliminating financial uncertainty but creating high utilization that strains infrastructure (facility crowding, parking scarcity) and personnel (service attitude problems from healthcare worker burnout). American patients navigating the multi-payer system face financial complexity and insurance navigation challenges but encounter lower facility utilization relative to capacity due to access barriers.

Importantly, institutional effects operate primarily through shaping which dimensions achieve salience rather than how dimensions are evaluated once salient. For the one universal dimension achieving High semantic similarity—emergency care—we observed a massive 1.46-star rating gap (U.S. 3.25 stars vs. Taiwan 1.79 stars, p < .001, d = 0.782), suggesting system structure powerfully influences satisfaction levels within dimensions. Taiwan's universal access removes demand-side barriers, potentially flooding emergency departments with non-urgent cases and creating severe overcrowding that drives satisfaction to the lowest rating in our entire dataset. American patients, facing substantial emergency room bills even with insurance, may use emergency services more selectively for truly urgent conditions, maintaining lower patient volume and higher satisfaction despite continued wait time complaints.

Cultural effects, while less powerful for dimensional composition, strongly influence evaluation standards within dimensions. The 1.67-star gap between Taiwan's medical professional quality (4.67 stars) and U.S. nursing care quality (3.00 stars)—though methodologically inappropriate for direct comparison due to Medium semantic similarity—suggests cultural differences in evaluation standards. Taiwan's high power distance culture fosters deference toward medical authority, generating expressions of gratitude when professionals meet expectations. American culture's lower power distance enables more critical evaluation, and individualistic values raise expectations for personalized attention that understaffed teams struggle to meet. However, we deliberately did not use this rating comparison for hypothesis testing precisely because the dimensions measure partially different constructs (physicians+nurses vs. nurses only; gratitude/respect vs. responsiveness/staffing).

This pattern—institutional effects dominating dimensional composition, cultural effects dominating evaluation standards—has important implications for service quality measurement. Cross-national comparison of patient satisfaction scores for predetermined dimensions (as in most existing research) may miss the fundamental finding that different systems generate different salient dimensions. A hospital scoring 4.0 on "professional quality" in Taiwan and 3.0 in the United States does not necessarily indicate lower quality in America; it may reflect different evaluation standards, different personnel being evaluated (physicians vs. nurses), or different aspects of care being emphasized. Dimensional composition must be examined before dimensional evaluation to avoid false comparisons.

### Emergency Care as a Universal Structural Challenge

Emergency care's dominance in both countries—30.9% of Taiwan reviews, 34.8% of U.S. reviews, both with low satisfaction despite very different systems—identifies emergency department management as a universal healthcare challenge that transcends system structure, cultural context, and financing mechanisms. This finding has important theoretical implications for healthcare systems research, which typically emphasizes how different systems generate different outcomes. While single-payer and multi-payer systems indeed create different access patterns, cost distributions, and administrative burdens, both struggle with emergency care demand management and patient satisfaction.

The universality of emergency care challenges likely stems from fundamental structural features shared across systems: emergency departments operate 24/7 with unpredictable demand, must treat all patients regardless of ability to pay (in most developed nations), face challenges triaging urgency levels, and serve both as safety-net providers for uninsured/underinsured populations and as convenient after-hours care for minor ailments. These structural features create similar operational challenges—overcrowding, long wait times, stressed personnel—regardless of how the system is financed or organized.

However, system structure shapes satisfaction levels within this universal challenge. Taiwan's 1.79-star rating (lowest in our entire dataset) versus America's 3.25-star rating suggests that universal access systems face greater demand-side pressures. When financial barriers are removed, patients may seek emergency care for conditions that could be treated in primary care settings if appointments were more readily available, exacerbating crowding. The multi-payer system's financial barriers may function as implicit demand management, maintaining lower patient volume relative to capacity at the cost of access inequity.

This finding suggests that emergency care reform requires both universal solutions (better triage systems, expanded capacity, improved patient flow) and system-specific solutions (Taiwan: demand management through enhanced primary care access; USA: financial barrier reduction to prevent delayed care leading to emergency presentations). International cooperation on emergency care best practices could be particularly valuable given the shared nature of the challenge, while acknowledging that optimal solutions must account for system-specific demand patterns.

### Cross-National Comparison Requires Semantic Equivalence

Our fourth theoretical contribution addresses a fundamental methodological challenge in cross-cultural research: when can dimensions be meaningfully compared across countries? We demonstrate that statistical significance does not justify cross-national rating comparisons when dimensions measure substantively different constructs. While independent samples t-tests can be computed for any topic pair, valid causal inference about cultural or institutional effects requires semantic equivalence—dimensions must measure the same underlying construct with similar conceptual scope (Harkness et al., 2003).

Our semantic similarity classification (High >70%, Medium 50-70%, Low <50%) operationalizes this principle. Only Emergency Care achieved High similarity: both countries' dimensions centrally focus on emergency department services, waiting times, and urgent care access with >70% thematic overlap. We therefore limited formal rating comparison and hypothesis testing to Emergency Care, treating Medium-similarity dimensions (Professional/Nursing Care, Outpatient Services, Inpatient Care) as qualitatively comparable but not quantitatively comparable for hypothesis testing.

This conservative methodological stance addresses a pervasive problem in cross-cultural service quality research: studies frequently compare predetermined SERVQUAL dimensions across countries without verifying that translated items carry equivalent meanings or that dimensions capture the same service aspects. When Taiwan's "Medical Professional Quality" emphasizes gratitude and combines physicians and nurses, while U.S. "Nursing Care Quality" emphasizes responsiveness and isolates nursing, directly comparing their ratings confounds three potential sources of variation: (1) genuine cultural differences in evaluation standards, (2) different referents (physicians vs. nurses), and (3) different evaluative criteria (gratitude/respect vs. responsiveness/staffing). Presence-versus-absence patterns provide cleaner evidence for cultural and institutional effects because they avoid this confound—the Service Attitude dimension's presence in Taiwan but absence in the United States definitively demonstrates cultural influence on dimensional salience.

This methodological contribution extends beyond LDA applications to all cross-cultural service quality research. Researchers should verify semantic equivalence before comparing ratings, perhaps through systematic protocols like ours (keyword analysis, representative text examination, expert judgment). When semantic equivalence is uncertain, presence-versus-absence patterns, proportion differences, and qualitative thematic comparisons provide interpretable evidence without requiring dimensional equivalence. When equivalence is high, quantitative rating comparisons become defensible. This tiered approach strengthens cross-cultural research by ensuring comparisons are methodologically justified rather than merely statistically computable.

## Practical Implications

Our findings provide actionable guidance for three stakeholder groups: hospital administrators, health policymakers, and international healthcare organizations.

### Implications for Hospital Administrators

Hospital administrators in both countries should prioritize emergency care transformation as the single most important service quality challenge. Emergency care dissatisfaction dominates patient discourse in Taiwan (30.9% of reviews, 1.79 stars) and the United States (34.8%, 3.25 stars), indicating that regardless of how well hospitals perform in other domains, emergency department problems fundamentally undermine overall patient satisfaction. Taiwanese hospitals face particularly severe challenges given the 1.79-star average—the lowest dimension rating in our entire cross-national dataset. Recommended interventions include: (1) implementing advanced triage systems that better differentiate urgent from non-urgent cases and redirect appropriate patients to outpatient services; (2) expanding emergency department capacity through dedicated staffing rather than relying on rotation from other departments; (3) improving patient communication about expected wait times and care processes, as uncertainty amplifies dissatisfaction; (4) developing fast-track systems for minor ailments that bypass full emergency protocols; and (5) strengthening integration between emergency departments and inpatient services to reduce admission delays that contribute to ED crowding.

Taiwanese hospitals should also prioritize service attitude training as the second-largest dissatisfaction driver (17.3% of reviews, 1.69 stars). This dimension's emergence as a distinct topic in Taiwan but not the United States indicates cultural context matters—collectivist cultures emphasizing interpersonal harmony show heightened sensitivity to perceived rudeness or impatience. However, the root causes likely involve both cultural factors and systemic pressures. High patient volume under NHI creates healthcare worker burnout, manifesting in brief, impersonal interactions that violate cultural expectations for respectful treatment. Interventions should address both symptoms and causes: (1) implementing service attitude training emphasizing communication skills, empathy, and cultural expectations for respectful interaction; (2) reducing healthcare worker burnout through improved staffing ratios, especially in high-volume departments; (3) recognizing and rewarding staff who consistently receive positive patient feedback on interpersonal treatment; (4) establishing clear service standards and accountability mechanisms for attitude-related complaints; and (5) addressing systemic volume issues through demand management and workflow optimization to reduce time pressure that contributes to curt interactions.

American hospitals must address billing transparency and simplification, given that 4.1% of patient discourse focuses exclusively on financial issues—surprise bills, insurance coverage denials, billing errors. While hospitals cannot unilaterally fix multi-payer system complexity, they can mitigate patient frustration through: (1) providing upfront cost estimates before procedures whenever possible; (2) assigning dedicated patient financial counselors to explain insurance coverage and anticipated out-of-pocket costs; (3) simplifying billing statements with plain-language explanations rather than cryptic medical codes; (4) establishing clear appeals processes for billing disputes with patient advocates; (5) offering financial assistance programs and payment plans prominently advertised in patient-facing materials; and (6) coordinating closely with insurance companies to reduce coverage disputes and prior authorization delays. Even hospitals providing excellent clinical care receive negative reviews when financial surprises undermine trust.

### Implications for Health Policymakers

Health policymakers face system-level challenges that individual hospitals cannot address alone. For Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare, our findings suggest three priorities. First, develop national emergency care standards addressing the systemic overcrowding problem rather than leaving solutions to individual hospitals. This might include: mandatory minimum staffing ratios for emergency departments based on patient volume; financial incentives for hospitals that achieve emergency care satisfaction targets; penalties for excessive wait times; and coordination across hospitals within regions to balance patient load. Second, address the service attitude issue through healthcare worker protection and training. This includes: enforcing maximum work hour regulations to prevent burnout; requiring interpersonal communication training in medical and nursing education; establishing national service quality certification programs emphasizing patient-centered care; and protecting healthcare workers from violence and harassment to reduce defensive behavior. Third, manage healthcare demand through enhanced primary care access to reduce emergency department misuse. This involves: strengthening the primary care network with adequate capacity; extending primary care hours to provide after-hours alternatives to emergency departments; and using financial incentives (modest co-payments) to encourage appropriate care-seeking without creating access barriers for genuinely urgent cases.

For U.S. policymakers, the billing and insurance issues dimension (entirely absent in Taiwan) demonstrates that multi-payer complexity imposes satisfaction penalties independent of clinical quality—our "system tax" concept. While comprehensive healthcare reform exceeds this study's scope, incremental improvements include: accelerating price transparency regulations requiring hospitals to publish procedure costs and insurance-negotiated rates in patient-accessible formats; standardizing insurance explanation of benefits documents across payers to reduce confusion; prohibiting surprise billing for out-of-network care at in-network facilities; streamlining prior authorization processes to reduce delays; and establishing independent patient advocacy offices to assist with billing disputes and insurance appeals. Additionally, policymakers should recognize that emergency care dissatisfaction (34.8% of reviews), while less severe than Taiwan (3.25 vs. 1.79 stars), still represents substantial patient frustration. Federal incentives for emergency department innovation, coordination across hospitals to manage regional patient flow, and addressing the root causes of emergency visits (inadequate primary care access for uninsured and underinsured populations) warrant attention.

Both countries' policymakers should recognize that emergency care challenges transcend system structure, suggesting opportunities for international cooperation. Establishing cross-national emergency care best practice exchanges, jointly funded research on emergency department management innovations, and systematic comparison of triage protocols could benefit both nations. Taiwan could learn from U.S. approaches to managing financial access barriers (recognizing that some patients appropriately avoid emergency care due to cost), while the United States could learn from Taiwan's universal access model's strengths (no patient delayed by insurance verification). The shared nature of the emergency care challenge makes this a particularly promising domain for international collaboration.

### Implications for International Healthcare Organizations

International healthcare organizations like the World Health Organization and OECD should recognize that patient-reported service quality dimensions vary systematically with healthcare system structure, necessitating contextualized rather than universal measurement frameworks. Current international healthcare quality assessments typically employ standardized surveys with predetermined dimensions, potentially missing system-specific concerns. Our findings suggest three improvements to international quality assessment. First, supplement structured surveys with unsupervised text analysis of patient narratives to identify system-specific dimensions that standardized instruments miss. Second, develop separate quality benchmarking systems for single-payer and multi-payer countries rather than direct comparisons, acknowledging that different systems face different challenges. Third, focus international comparisons on dimensions achieving High semantic similarity across systems (emergency care, medical professionalism) where meaningful benchmarking is possible, while recognizing that system-specific dimensions require within-system rather than between-system comparison.

## Methodological Contributions

Beyond theoretical advancement, this study contributes a replicable framework for cross-lingual LDA analysis in healthcare and service quality research, comprising three methodological innovations that address persistent challenges in applied topic modeling.

### Integrated Topic Number Selection Framework

Selecting the optimal number of topics K remains one of the most consequential yet contested decisions in LDA applications (Greene et al., 2014). Statistical metrics such as coherence and perplexity frequently disagree with human interpretability judgments, and different research goals favor different trade-offs between statistical optimization and practical utility. We developed an integrated selection framework balancing four criteria: (1) statistical coherence quantifying how frequently topic words co-occur in documents; (2) model perplexity measuring held-out document prediction; (3) semantic interpretability assessed by domain experts reviewing top keywords and representative texts; and (4) theoretical alignment with established service quality frameworks (SERVQUAL, Dagger et al.'s healthcare quality hierarchy).

For Taiwan, statistical metrics favored K=5 (highest coherence 0.4326), yet domain experts rated K=7 (coherence 0.4175) as more interpretable because the seven-topic solution successfully isolated "Facility and Environment Quality" from administrative processes and separated surgical specialty care from general professional quality—distinctions consistent with healthcare service quality theory. We prioritized interpretability and theoretical alignment over marginal coherence gains, acknowledging that researcher judgment is irreducible in topic modeling. However, our transparent documentation of all criteria and their trade-offs enables readers to evaluate whether alternative choices might yield different conclusions and provides a replicable template for future researchers facing similar decisions.

This integrated framework addresses a methodological gap in applied LDA research where topic number selection often appears arbitrary or is justified solely by a single statistical metric. Future studies should adopt multi-criteria frameworks that balance statistical performance with domain-specific interpretability and theoretical alignment. Importantly, our framework acknowledges that no objectively "correct" K exists—topic modeling involves interpretive judgment—but provides principled, transparent criteria for that judgment.

### Systematic Cross-Lingual Semantic Mapping Protocol

Enabling cross-cultural comparison while respecting linguistic and cultural differences represents a fundamental challenge in cross-lingual text analysis. We established a systematic semantic mapping protocol comprising four stages: (1) independent LDA extraction within each language without forced alignment, preserving authentic linguistic and cultural patterns; (2) bilingual expert semantic interpretation examining top keywords, representative high-probability reviews (probability ≥ 0.90), and rating distributions; (3) dimensional alignment based on conceptual equivalence rather than literal translation, with explicit similarity classification (High >70%, Medium 50-70%, Low <50%); and (4) tiered statistical comparison strategy—presence-versus-absence for all dimensions, proportion differences for universal dimensions, rating comparisons only for High-similarity dimensions.

This protocol avoids a common pitfall in cross-lingual topic modeling: forcing identical topic numbers across languages and mechanically matching topics based solely on keyword overlap. Such approaches risk imposing false equivalence between semantically distinct dimensions or failing to identify culture-specific dimensions that have no cross-cultural equivalent. By conducting independent LDA extraction before attempting mapping, we allow each culture's authentic dimensional structure to emerge. By classifying semantic similarity rather than assuming equivalence, we enable differentiated comparison strategies appropriate to each level of similarity.

The protocol proved essential for our finding that dimensions vary in comparability. Emergency Care achieved High similarity, enabling valid rating comparison and hypothesis testing. Professional/Nursing Care achieved only Medium similarity due to different personnel focus (Taiwan: physicians+nurses; USA: nurses only) and evaluative emphasis (Taiwan: gratitude/respect; USA: responsiveness/staffing), making rating comparison methodologically problematic despite statistical significance. Service Attitude (Taiwan only) and Billing/Insurance (USA only) showed Low similarity (no cross-cultural equivalent), best analyzed through presence-versus-absence patterns. Without systematic similarity assessment, we might have erroneously compared all dimensions quantitatively, conflating genuine cultural differences with measurement artifacts.

This protocol extends beyond healthcare applications to any cross-lingual text analysis where researchers seek to compare themes, topics, or dimensions across languages and cultures. The key insight is that comparability must be established rather than assumed, requiring explicit similarity assessment and tiered comparison strategies matched to similarity levels.

### Multi-Method Topic Validation Framework

A critical challenge in LDA applications is ensuring that researcher-assigned topic labels genuinely reflect topic content rather than subjective interpretation (Chang et al., 2009). While LDA discovers topics algorithmically, labeling them requires researcher judgment. We addressed this through multi-method validation combining quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment: (1) representative text analysis extracting high-probability reviews (probability ≥ 0.90) and verifying alignment with assigned labels, achieving 95% agreement rate; (2) keyword overlap analysis calculating pairwise overlap for top-10 keywords, with mean overlap of 16.2% (Taiwan) and 14.8% (USA), both below the 20% discrimination threshold (Mimno et al., 2011); (3) internal consistency assessment through mean topic probabilities (Taiwan: 0.597-0.711; USA: 0.603-0.695, all exceeding 0.50 threshold for clear assignment) and rating variance alignment with expected valence; and (4) theoretical alignment mapping all topics to established service quality frameworks (SERVQUAL, Dagger et al.), achieving complete correspondence (Taiwan 7/7, USA 6/6).

These four validation methods triangulate evidence that topic labels accurately capture patient concerns rather than reflecting researcher preconceptions. Representative text analysis confirms labels match actual review content, keyword overlap analysis demonstrates topics represent genuinely distinct dimensions, internal consistency indicates unambiguous topic assignment, and theoretical alignment provides external validity through convergence with theory-driven constructs. This multi-method approach substantially exceeds the common practice of relying solely on keyword inspection for validation.

Importantly, we acknowledge validation limitations: topic labels required interpretive judgment despite systematic validation, some keyword overlap is inevitable with domain-general vocabulary (all reviews mention doctors, care, hospitals), and we lacked resources for formal inter-coder reliability with external expert panels. However, our validation framework provides a replicable template for future LDA applications seeking to demonstrate topic validity. By triangulating multiple validation methods—each with different assumptions and potential biases—we offer stronger evidence for topic robustness than any single method could provide.

## Limitations

While our study provides novel insights into cross-national service quality dimensions, several limitations constrain interpretation and generalizability, suggesting directions for future research.

### Data Source and Sample Limitations

Our reliance on Google Maps reviews introduces four limitations. First, Google reviewers represent a self-selected sample potentially biased toward younger, more technologically proficient, and more strongly satisfied or dissatisfied patients (extremity bias). Research suggests online review distributions correlate reasonably with validated patient satisfaction surveys (Ranard et al., 2016), but this correlation is imperfect. Patients with moderate experiences or technological barriers are underrepresented. Second, we cannot verify reviewer identity or confirm they were actual patients versus family members, companions, or even fraudulent reviewers. This limitation is inherent to all online review research but is partially mitigated by Google's location history verification requirement. Third, the bi-modal rating distribution (high concentration at 1-star and 5-star ratings, with 32.4% and 42.6% of Taiwan reviews respectively) suggests online platforms elicit polarized feedback from patients experiencing exceptional satisfaction or profound dissatisfaction, potentially missing the "middle" of the patient experience distribution. Fourth, our focus on top-tier hospitals (Taiwan's 26 medical centers, U.S. News top-28 hospitals) limits generalizability to community hospitals or rural facilities. Elite institutions may face different service quality challenges and patient expectations than typical hospitals, though these top-tier institutions disproportionately influence healthcare quality standards and practices.

Future research should address these limitations through multi-method data collection combining online reviews with structured surveys, patient interviews, and clinical records to triangulate findings. Demographic data collection (challenging with online reviews due to anonymity) would enable analysis of whether quality dimensions vary by patient age, gender, socioeconomic status, or health conditions. Expanding sampling to include community hospitals and rural facilities would test whether our findings generalize beyond elite institutions.

### Cross-Sectional Design Limitations

Our cross-sectional data collection (July 2024) captures a snapshot of patient sentiment but cannot identify temporal trends or test causality. Healthcare systems evolve—Taiwan's NHI implemented reforms, U.S. price transparency regulations changed during our study period—yet we cannot assess how these policy changes influenced service quality dimensions or patient satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted healthcare delivery globally, potentially altering patient priorities and service quality challenges in ways our data cannot disentangle from pre-pandemic patterns. Reviews span 2018-2024, encompassing both pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods, but we lack sufficient temporal resolution to analyze pandemic effects specifically.

Longitudinal research tracking how service quality dimensions evolve over time would provide valuable insights into whether dimensions are stable or dynamic, how policy reforms influence patient priorities, and whether the pandemic created lasting changes in patient expectations. Panel data following the same patients across multiple healthcare encounters would enable within-person analysis of satisfaction determinants, controlling for individual heterogeneity in evaluation standards.

### Methodological Limitations of Topic Modeling

LDA, while powerful for unsupervised theme extraction, carries inherent limitations. Topic number selection (K) required subjective judgment despite our systematic framework—different researchers might reasonably select alternative K values with different interpretations. We provide coherence and perplexity statistics for multiple K values and transparent justification for our choices, but cannot claim K=7 (Taiwan) and K=6 (USA) are objectively "correct." Topic labels, although validated through multiple methods, required interpretive judgment—alternative labels might be equally defensible. For instance, Taiwan Topic 1 could reasonably be labeled "Medical Professional Quality," "Healthcare Worker Competence," or "Clinical Excellence," each emphasizing different nuances.

LDA assumes documents are mixtures of topics with bag-of-words representation, ignoring word order, sentence structure, and contextual meaning. This assumption improves computational tractability but discards information. Reviews stating "The doctor was not incompetent" and "The doctor was incompetent" generate identical bag-of-words representations despite opposite meanings. While we preserved negation markers in Chinese preprocessing (不, 沒有) and English (not, no, never), LDA's fundamental bag-of-words assumption limits semantic sophistication.

Future research could employ alternative text analysis methods addressing these limitations: structural topic modeling incorporating document-level covariates (country, hospital type, patient demographics); neural topic models leveraging word embeddings to capture semantic similarity; transformer-based models (BERT, GPT) enabling context-aware analysis; or supervised machine learning training classifiers on expert-labeled reviews. However, these alternatives sacrifice LDA's advantage—unsupervised discovery without predetermined categories—making LDA particularly appropriate for exploratory identification of service quality dimensions without researcher-imposed frameworks.

### Limited Hypothesis Testing

Of our original 11 hypotheses (6 cultural, 5 institutional), we tested only 4 with strong methodological justification. Seven hypotheses required analytical methods beyond topic modeling's capabilities: keyword frequency analysis (H3: shared decision-making; H5: outcome vs. credential focus), qualitative discourse analysis (H6: communication directness), or temporal keyword analysis (IH3: consultation time complaints). These untested hypotheses represent limitations but also opportunities for future research. Follow-up studies could apply complementary methods—n-gram analysis identifying multi-word phrases, sentiment analysis distinguishing positive/negative mentions of specific constructs, or qualitative coding of randomly sampled reviews—to test hypotheses our data-driven approach could not definitively address.

Additionally, our conservative statistical testing strategy—limiting rating comparisons to High-similarity dimensions only—meant we could not test certain hypotheses even when dimensions existed in both countries. For instance, we identified Professional/Nursing Care dimensions in both countries but avoided rating comparison because these dimensions measure partially different constructs (Medium semantic similarity). This methodological conservatism strengthens the hypotheses we did test by ensuring clean comparisons, but leaves questions unanswered. Future research with survey data could directly measure construct equivalence (establishing measurement invariance) before comparing ratings, providing complementary evidence to our topic modeling approach.

### Cultural and Linguistic Complexity

Our bilingual analysis (Chinese, English) enabled cross-cultural comparison but simplified cultural complexity. Taiwan represents one East Asian cultural context (Confucian heritage, collectivist values, high power distance), but East Asian cultures vary substantially—Japan, South Korea, and mainland China exhibit different cultural values and healthcare systems despite geographic and linguistic proximity. The United States represents Western individualistic culture but contains substantial internal diversity across regions, racial/ethnic groups, and immigrant populations. Our analysis treats each country as culturally homogeneous, potentially obscuring important within-country variation.

Language presents additional complexity. Chinese reviews employ culturally specific rhetorical devices—four-character idioms (成語), implicit subjects, indirect criticism—that resist direct translation. English reviews exhibit culture-specific patterns—explicit service recovery narratives, direct criticism, superlatives—reflecting American communication norms. While we deliberately preserved these authentic linguistic patterns rather than forcing equivalence, perfect cross-linguistic comparability is neither achievable nor desirable when the goal is capturing authentic cultural priorities. However, some cross-national differences we attribute to culture or system structure might partially reflect linguistic patterns rather than underlying differences in patient experiences.

Future cross-cultural research should expand to multiple countries within cultural clusters (East Asia: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China; West: USA, UK, Canada, Australia) to distinguish cultural patterns from country-specific idiosyncrasies. Multilingual teams with native speakers and cultural insiders for each country would enhance linguistic and cultural interpretation. Mixed-methods approaches combining text analysis with ethnographic observation and patient interviews would provide deeper understanding of how cultural values shape service quality priorities and evaluation standards.

## Future Research Directions

Our findings open several promising research directions. First, longitudinal analysis tracking how service quality dimensions evolve over time would reveal whether dimensions are stable or dynamic, how policy reforms influence patient priorities, and whether the pandemic created lasting changes. Second, expanding cross-national comparison to additional countries would test whether our Taiwan-USA patterns generalize—particularly valuable would be comparisons across single-payer systems (Taiwan, UK, Canada) and multi-payer systems (USA, Switzerland, Netherlands) to isolate system effects from country-specific factors. Third, linking patient review data to clinical outcomes, hospital characteristics, and regional socioeconomic indicators would enable multi-level analysis explaining why some hospitals achieve high satisfaction within the same system structure. Fourth, experimental studies manipulating specific service quality dimensions (e.g., reducing emergency wait times, enhancing service attitude training) would test causal mechanisms our cross-sectional data can only suggest. Fifth, applying complementary text analysis methods—sentiment analysis, n-gram analysis, neural topic models—would address limitations of LDA's bag-of-words assumption and test hypotheses beyond topic modeling's capabilities.

## Conclusions

This study provides the first systematic cross-national comparison of healthcare service quality dimensions using identical unsupervised topic modeling methods applied to patient-generated online reviews from Taiwan and the United States. Our findings demonstrate that service quality is simultaneously universal and contingent: while core concerns such as emergency care, professional competence, and administrative processes appear across both countries, accounting for approximately 78% of patient discourse, healthcare system structure and cultural context fundamentally shape which additional dimensions achieve salience and how all dimensions are evaluated.

We make three principal contributions. Theoretically, we reconcile the longstanding debate between universal and culturally-contingent perspectives in service quality research by demonstrating that institutional effects dominate dimensional composition—determining which quality aspects coalesce into distinct dimensions—while cultural effects primarily influence evaluation standards within dimensions. We introduce the concept of "system tax" to describe how multi-payer healthcare systems impose satisfaction penalties independent of clinical quality: billing and insurance issues constitute 4.1% of U.S. patient discourse yet are entirely absent from Taiwan's single-payer structure. Emergency care emerges as a universal structural challenge transcending system boundaries, dominating patient discourse in both countries (30.9% Taiwan, 34.8% USA) with low satisfaction despite vastly different financing mechanisms, suggesting that some healthcare challenges require international cooperation rather than system-specific solutions.

Methodologically, we advance cross-cultural text analysis by developing and validating three innovations: an integrated topic number selection framework balancing statistical coherence with semantic interpretability and theoretical alignment, a systematic cross-lingual semantic mapping protocol enabling comparison while respecting linguistic differences through explicit similarity classification (High/Medium/Low), and a multi-method topic validation framework triangulating evidence from representative texts, keyword overlap, internal consistency, and theoretical alignment. These innovations provide replicable templates for future cross-cultural topic modeling applications, with the critical insight that statistical significance does not justify cross-national rating comparisons when dimensions measure substantively different constructs—only dimensions achieving High semantic similarity support valid rating comparison.

Practically, our findings provide actionable guidance for hospital administrators and health policymakers. Taiwan's hospitals should prioritize emergency care transformation (30.9% of reviews, 1.79 stars) and service attitude training (17.3%, 1.69 stars) to address the two largest dissatisfaction drivers. U.S. hospitals should focus on billing transparency and simplification to mitigate the "system tax" burden (4.1% of discourse) and emergency care improvements (34.8%, 3.25 stars). Policymakers in both countries should recognize emergency care as requiring system-level intervention beyond individual hospital initiatives, including demand management through enhanced primary care access (Taiwan) and financial barrier reduction preventing delayed care (USA). International healthcare organizations should develop contextualized rather than universal quality measurement frameworks, acknowledging that different systems generate different salient dimensions requiring separate benchmarking approaches.

This research demonstrates the value of combining unsupervised machine learning with cross-cultural research methods to discover how institutional structures and cultural values jointly shape patient quality perceptions. By allowing dimensions to emerge from patient discourse rather than imposing predetermined frameworks, we reveal patterns invisible to traditional survey approaches—particularly the presence of system-specific dimensions that standardized instruments systematically miss. As healthcare systems worldwide grapple with quality improvement amid financial constraints, understanding which quality challenges are universal and which are system-specific becomes essential for effective resource allocation and international learning. Our findings suggest that while all health systems can learn from each other's approaches to universal challenges like emergency care management and professional excellence, system-specific challenges like billing complexity or interpersonal attitude sensitivity require solutions tailored to institutional and cultural contexts. The future of healthcare quality research lies in hybrid approaches recognizing both commonality and contingency across the world's diverse healthcare systems.
