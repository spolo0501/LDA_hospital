# 2.3 Healthcare Systems: Taiwan vs. United States

While Section 2.2 established that cultural values shape service quality expectations, institutional structures—how healthcare is organized, financed, and regulated—also profoundly influence patient experiences and priorities (Scott, 2008; Kuhlmann et al., 2020). Taiwan and the United States represent polar opposite healthcare system models that create distinct structural constraints shaping patient-provider interactions and service quality dimensions.

## 2.3.1 Contrasting Healthcare System Models

Taiwan operates a universal, single-payer National Health Insurance (NHI) system achieving 99.9% population coverage with comprehensive benefits and minimal cost-sharing ($5-$17 per visit). The United States employs a fragmented, market-based, multi-payer model with 9% uninsured and substantial patient cost burdens (annual deductibles averaging $1,669 for individuals) (Cheng, 2015; Tikkanen et al., 2020). These structural differences generate divergent utilization patterns and service delivery characteristics. Taiwanese residents average 14.2 outpatient visits annually versus 4.0 in the United States, reflecting unrestricted access but creating provider crowding. Taiwan's fee-for-service payment within global budget constraints incentivizes maximizing patient volume, producing consultation times of three to five minutes compared to fifteen to twenty minutes in the United States (Tai-Seale et al., 2007; OECD Health Statistics, 2022). Healthcare spending constitutes 6.6% of GDP in Taiwan versus 17.8% in the United States, with catastrophic health expenditures affecting only 1.8% of Taiwan households compared to 21% in America (World Bank, 2022; Papanicolas et al., 2018).

## 2.3.2 Institutional Effects on Service Quality Dimensions

### Taiwan's Institutional Constraints

Taiwan's high-utilization, low-cost system creates distinctive service quality challenges despite achieving universal access. The combination of unrestricted provider choice and fee-for-service payment within fixed budgets generates extreme volume pressure—hospital physicians routinely conduct forty to sixty consultations per half-day session (Cheng and Chiang, 2012). These compressed three to five minute encounters directly constrain communication quality, with 47% of hospital physicians reporting emotional exhaustion from workload intensity (Tsai et al., 2009). Patients experience immediate access without waiting lists but encounter crowded facilities and rushed interactions. Conversely, financial dimensions remain largely absent from quality evaluations—low, predictable copayments functionally eliminate cost considerations from care-seeking decisions. Administrative processes focus on registration efficiency and medication pickup logistics given high-frequency utilization.

### United States' Institutional Barriers

America's high-cost, fragmented system elevates financial and access barriers as primary quality concerns. High deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance create widespread financial stress, with 45% of adults reporting delayed or forgone care due to cost (Commonwealth Fund, 2020). Medical debt represents Americans' most common debt in collection, and medical expenses constitute the leading bankruptcy cause (Himmelstein et al., 2019). Insurance complexity generates administrative burdens through prior authorization requirements, network restrictions, and coverage disputes that pervade patient experiences. Access manifests as appointment delays—primary care averaging twenty-four days, specialists thirty to fifty days (Merritt Hawkins, 2017)—rather than on-site crowding. However, longer consultation times and lower patient volumes (fifteen to twenty-five daily) potentially enable stronger patient-provider relationships and more thorough communication than Taiwan's high-volume model (Tai-Seale et al., 2007).

## 2.3.3 Culture-Institution Interactions and Service Quality Implications

Cultural and institutional effects interact rather than operating independently to shape service quality configurations. Following Oliver's (1980) expectation-disconfirmation theory, satisfaction derives from the gap between expectations and perceived performance. Taiwan's cultural emphasis on empathy and interpersonal warmth (Section 2.2) combined with institutional constraints limiting consultations to three to five minutes creates a larger expectation-disconfirmation gap than cultural preferences alone predict. Taiwanese patients value communication (cultural expectation) but cannot receive adequate interaction time (institutional constraint), potentially generating more severe communication complaints than in the United States despite similar cultural preferences. Conversely, American institutional cost burdens may overwhelm cultural preferences for other quality dimensions—patients discuss cost extensively not primarily because individualist values prioritize cost-benefit analysis, but because institutional reality (high costs, variable coverage) forces cost consideration regardless of cultural orientation. These interactions demonstrate that institutional factors can dominate cultural tendencies when structural constraints strongly shape feasible behaviors.

## Summary

Taiwan's single-payer NHI and America's market-based system create fundamentally different patient experiences. Taiwan achieves universal coverage with minimal costs but generates volume pressure producing brief consultations and crowding, while the United States maintains longer consultations but imposes financial barriers and access delays. Institutional structures shape service quality dimensions independently of cultural values, while culture-institution interactions produce magnified effects. Section 2.4 examines online reviews as data sources, while Section 2.5 addresses text mining methodologies.
