# 2.2 Cross-Cultural Differences in Service Quality Perceptions

While Section 2.1 established that service quality is multidimensional and context-dependent, culture shapes what customers expect, value, and evaluate in service encounters (Donthu and Yoo, 1998; Furrer et al., 2000). This section reviews cross-cultural service quality research foundations and develops expectations for how Taiwanese and American patients may differ in hospital service quality perceptions.

## 2.2.1 Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions and Service Quality

Hofstede's (1980, 2001) cultural dimensions theory provides the most widely applied framework for understanding cross-cultural consumer behavior differences. Taiwan and the United States exhibit stark contrasts across six dimensions. Most dramatically, individualism differs profoundly—Taiwan scores 17 (highly collectivist) versus the United States' 91 (highly individualist), a 74-point gap suggesting fundamental differences in service priorities. Power distance shows Taiwan at 58 (moderate-high) versus U.S. 40 (moderate-low), shaping physician-patient authority relationships. Taiwan's higher uncertainty avoidance (69 versus 46) predicts greater demand for detailed information and testing. Taiwan's moderate-feminine orientation (MAS=45) compared to U.S. moderate-masculine (MAS=62) suggests Taiwanese patients emphasize empathy and caring while Americans prioritize efficiency and results. Long-term orientation contrasts dramatically—Taiwan's 93 versus U.S. 26 indicates different preventive versus acute care emphases (Hofstede, 2001).

Empirical research consistently demonstrates these dimensions shape service quality priorities. Furrer et al.'s (2000) seventeen-country study found collectivist cultures rated empathy as most important (mean weight = 0.35) while individualist cultures prioritized reliability (0.32), with individualism negatively correlating with empathy importance (r = -0.64, p < 0.01). High power-distance cultures assigned significantly higher importance to provider assurance and competence (Furrer et al., 2000; Donthu and Yoo, 1998). Healthcare-specific research reveals culture-unique dimensions: Andaleeb (2001) identified "responsiveness to family" as a distinct factor in collectivist Bangladesh that explained more satisfaction variance than several clinical dimensions—a dimension absent from Western studies reflecting individualist privacy emphases.

## 2.2.2 Cross-Cultural Measurement and Methodological Approach

Traditional cross-cultural service quality research using standardized surveys like SERVQUAL faces measurement equivalence challenges concerning whether constructs, items, and scales carry identical meanings across cultures (Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998). Cultural differences in acquiescence bias and response styles complicate direct comparisons. Moreover, predetermined survey instruments developed in Western contexts may impose culturally-biased dimensional structures, missing dimensions salient in non-Western settings like family accommodation in collectivist healthcare (Andaleeb, 2001).

The current study's text-mining approach partially mitigates these challenges by allowing service quality dimensions to emerge inductively from patients' own words rather than imposing predetermined constructs. Without survey items or Likert scales, we avoid item equivalence issues and response style biases. Open-ended narratives captured in online reviews reveal patients' spontaneous priorities—what aspects they found sufficiently important to publicly discuss—consistent with person-centred care principles (Giusti et al., 2020). This inductive approach enables discovery of culture-specific dimensions while identifying universal healthcare concerns, testing whether culturally-predicted differences empirically manifest in patient discourse.

Beyond cultural values, institutional structures—healthcare system organization, financing, and delivery—profoundly influence patient priorities. Section 2.3 examines how Taiwan's National Health Insurance versus America's market-based system creates additional service quality variations through system-level constraints and incentives.
