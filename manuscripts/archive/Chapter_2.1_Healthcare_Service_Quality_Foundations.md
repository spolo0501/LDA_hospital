# 2.1 Healthcare Service Quality: Theoretical Foundations

Service quality has been recognized as a multidimensional construct since Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry's (1985) seminal conceptualization as "the gap between customer expectations and perceptions of service delivery." The most influential operationalization emerged through SERVQUAL (Parasuraman et al., 1988), identifying five generic dimensions—tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy—applicable across service industries. This framework revolutionized service research by providing standardized measurement, though critics note that factor structures vary across contexts and generic dimensions may inadequately capture industry-specific attributes (Buttle, 1996; Cronin and Taylor, 1992).

Healthcare-specific frameworks recognize that medical service characteristics necessitate context adaptation. Donabedian's (1988) structure-process-outcome model conceptualizes quality across organizational capacity (facilities, equipment), care delivery activities (clinical procedures, interactions), and health effects (outcomes, satisfaction). Dagger et al. (2007) developed a healthcare-specific model through patient interviews, identifying interpersonal quality, technical quality, environment quality, and administrative quality, with interpersonal quality emerging as the strongest loyalty predictor despite information asymmetry limiting technical quality assessment. Contemporary person-centred care research emphasizes patient dignity, shared decision-making, and family integration as critical quality attributes extending beyond traditional frameworks (Giusti et al., 2020).

## Healthcare Service Unique Characteristics

Healthcare services possess distinctive features differentiating them from other service sectors and shaping quality perceptions (Berry and Bendapudi, 2007). Healthcare involves intensive interpersonal contact requiring information exchange (patients disclosing intimate details), trust in providers' clinical judgment, and emotional labor as providers manage patient anxiety while delivering technical information. Extreme information asymmetry characterizes healthcare—patients typically lack medical knowledge to evaluate diagnostic and treatment technical quality, making healthcare a credence good whose quality cannot be fully assessed even after consumption (Andaleeb, 2001; Darby and Karni, 1973). This asymmetry creates substitution effects where patients rely on observable functional attributes (physician attentiveness, facility cleanliness, wait times) as proxy indicators of unobservable technical quality. Consequently, functional quality often dominates technical quality in patient evaluations despite technical quality mattering more for objective health outcomes (Donabedian, 1988; Dagger et al., 2007).

Outcome uncertainty complicates quality assessment—patients may not recover despite excellent care or improve despite suboptimal care due to natural healing. This means patients cannot reliably infer process quality from outcome quality, heightening emotional sensitivity to service encounters and amplifying negative experience impacts (Berry and Bendapudi, 2007). Additionally, healthcare consumption is often involuntary and patient choice constrained by insurance networks, geography, urgency, and referral requirements, reducing competitive pressure for quality improvement (Oliver, 1980).

## The Need for Exploratory Methods

While theoretical frameworks provide valuable conceptual foundations, predetermined structures suffer from limitations necessitating exploratory, data-driven approaches. First, SERVQUAL's dimensions derived from non-healthcare focus groups may miss context-specific concerns unique to particular settings or temporal periods—Taiwan's National Health Insurance may generate concerns differing from U.S. market-based insurance, while COVID-19 introduced entirely new dimensions (infection control, telemedicine) absent from pre-2020 frameworks. Second, survey instruments constrain patient expression to predetermined attributes—patients cannot introduce concerns like parking availability if not surveyed. Third, applying identical instruments across cultures assumes dimensional equivalence where it may not exist; family accommodation may constitute critical quality in collectivist cultures but remain unmeasured by Western-developed surveys (Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998; Andaleeb, 2001).

The current study addresses these limitations through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling on patient-generated online reviews, allowing service quality dimensions to emerge inductively from patient narratives rather than being researcher-imposed. This exploratory approach honors context-specificity and temporal evolution documented in the literature while privileging patient voices in defining quality constructs consistent with person-centred care principles (Giusti et al., 2020). Section 2.2 examines cross-cultural service quality research to develop expectations about how cultural differences between Taiwan and the United States may shape dimensional structures.
