# 2.3 Healthcare Systems: Taiwan vs. United States

While Section 2.2 established that cultural values shape service quality expectations, institutional structures—how healthcare is organized, financed, and regulated—also profoundly influence what patients experience, prioritize, and evaluate (Scott, 2008; Kuhlmann et al., 2020). Taiwan and the United States represent polar opposite healthcare system models. Taiwan operates a universal, single-payer National Health Insurance (NHI) system with comprehensive coverage and minimal out-of-pocket costs, while the United States employs a market-based, multi-payer model with variable coverage and high costs (Tikkanen et al., 2020). These institutional differences create distinct structural constraints and incentives that shape patient-provider interactions and service quality dimensions.

This section compares the two healthcare systems and develops expectations for how institutional differences may manifest in patient online reviews beyond cultural effects. The comparison illuminates how system-level factors interact with cultural values to produce country-specific service quality configurations.

## 2.3.1 Taiwan's National Health Insurance System

### System Overview and Historical Context

Taiwan implemented its National Health Insurance program in 1995, achieving universal healthcare coverage in less than a decade—one of the fastest transitions globally (Wu et al., 2018; Cheng, 2015). The NHI represents a mandatory, single-payer social insurance system financed through payroll taxes, government subsidies, and modest premiums, all administered by a centralized government agency, the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA). This rapid universalization of health coverage has been compared favorably to similar transitions in other East Asian contexts, particularly South Korea, where both countries achieved universal coverage despite starting from commercial insurance-dominated systems (Yi et al., 2015).

The NHI's design reflects several distinctive characteristics that fundamentally shape healthcare delivery and patient experiences. The system achieves nearly complete population coverage, with 99.9% of Taiwan's 23.5 million residents enrolled as of 2020 (Cheng, 2015). This universality extends beyond mere enrollment to encompass comprehensive benefits covering outpatient care, hospitalization, prescription drugs, dental care, traditional Chinese medicine, and preventive services. Unlike many insurance systems that restrict coverage through benefit limitations or high cost-sharing, Taiwan's NHI maintains low financial barriers while preserving patient choice through the absence of gatekeeping mechanisms—patients can directly access any specialist or medical center without referral requirements.

The financing mechanism relies on a global budget system that allocates fixed annual budgets across regions and provider categories. Within these budgetary constraints, providers receive fee-for-service payments, creating a hybrid model that incentivizes both efficiency and volume. This payment structure has generated distinctive provider behaviors and patient experiences that differ markedly from purely fee-for-service or capitated systems (Liu and Tsai, 2019). The global budget caps total expenditure growth while fee-for-service payment within those caps creates pressure to maximize patient throughput, producing shorter consultation times and higher patient volumes than systems without such dual constraints.

### Access and Utilization Patterns

Taiwan's NHI has achieved exceptional accessibility, creating healthcare utilization patterns that stand out even among universal coverage systems. Taiwanese residents average 14.2 outpatient visits per capita annually (2020 data), a figure that substantially exceeds the OECD average of 6.8 visits and represents among the highest utilization rates globally (OECD Health Statistics, 2022). This high utilization reflects both the absence of financial barriers and the elimination of gatekeeping restrictions that might otherwise moderate demand. The infrastructure supporting this utilization includes a dense network of healthcare facilities, with 21.7 hospitals per million population compared to 19.5 in the United States (Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2021). Geographic accessibility further reinforces utilization, with 93% of the population residing within five kilometers of a contracted medical facility (Cheng, 2015).

Perhaps most distinctively, Taiwan's NHI virtually eliminates waiting times for care. Unlike universal coverage systems in Canada or the United Kingdom that experience months-long queues for elective procedures, Taiwan maintains no waiting lists, with same-day or next-day appointments representing the norm rather than the exception (Wu et al., 2018). This immediate accessibility creates patient expectations fundamentally different from those in wait-list systems, where access itself constitutes a quality dimension. For Taiwanese patients, the question is not whether they can obtain care but what quality of interpersonal interaction and clinical attention they will receive during that care.

This accessibility paradoxically generates its own service quality challenges. The combination of free provider choice and high utilization creates significant crowding, particularly at major medical centers. Physicians in hospital outpatient clinics routinely see forty to sixty patients per half-day session, far exceeding patient loads in comparable Western systems (Cheng and Chiang, 2012). This volume pressure directly affects consultation duration and interpersonal quality. Additionally, the absence of gatekeeping enables what healthcare analysts term "doctor shopping," where patients consult multiple providers for the same condition—23% of patients visit four or more clinics within thirty days for a single health problem (Cheng, 2015). This behavior reflects both patient empowerment through choice and potential dissatisfaction or lack of trust in initial encounters.

### Cost Structure and Financial Protection

Taiwan's NHI achieves healthcare delivery at remarkably low cost both to the system and to individual patients. Total health expenditure constitutes only 6.6% of GDP (2020), positioning Taiwan among the most cost-efficient health systems globally, particularly when compared to the United States at 17.8% or the OECD average of 9.9% (World Bank, 2022). This efficiency derives partly from centralized price negotiation and partly from constraining provider revenues through global budgets. While out-of-pocket spending represents 35.4% of total health expenditure, appearing moderate by international standards (OECD average: 20%), the absolute amounts remain low due to Taiwan's overall low health spending. Catastrophic health expenditures—defined as payments exceeding 40% of household capacity to pay—affect only 1.8% of households (Cheng, 2015), indicating strong financial protection despite the moderate out-of-pocket share.

The copayment structure maintains low financial barriers while attempting to steer patients toward appropriate care levels. A clinic visit costs approximately US$5, regional hospital outpatient visits US$10, and medical center outpatient visits without referral US$17. Hospitalization requires copayments of US$8 to US$50 per day depending on room type, with emergency visits costing US$17 if the patient is not subsequently admitted (Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2023). These amounts represent minimal fractions of household budgets for most Taiwanese families, functionally eliminating financial considerations from care-seeking decisions for routine health needs.

This low-cost structure profoundly shapes service quality expectations and complaints. Unlike American patients who frequently cite billing problems, surprise charges, and insurance coverage disputes in reviews (Ranard et al., 2016), cost concerns rarely surface in Taiwanese patient evaluations. Patients evaluate clinical and interpersonal quality essentially independent of financial considerations, creating a service quality calculus focused on care delivery rather than value-for-money trade-offs. However, cost is not entirely absent from Taiwanese healthcare experiences. Some providers offer self-paid "premium services" such as newer surgical techniques, advanced medications, or private hospital rooms not covered by standard NHI benefits, creating a limited two-tier system where patients can opt for upgraded care at additional cost (Liu and Tsai, 2019). These premium options introduce cost considerations for specific services while leaving routine care financially accessible.

### Provider Behavior and Payment Incentives

The NHI's payment methodology—fee-for-service within global budget constraints—creates distinctive provider incentives that directly affect patient experiences. Providers receive payment for each service rendered (consultation, diagnostic test, procedure), but total revenue across all providers within a region cannot exceed predetermined budget caps. When aggregate spending approaches budget limits, the payment per service declines proportionally. This system creates pressure to maximize patient throughput—seeing more patients generates more billable visits—while global budgets prevent unlimited revenue expansion, constraining resources available per patient encounter (Cheng and Chiang, 2012).

The most visible consequence appears in consultation duration. Studies document average consultation times of three to five minutes in primary care clinics and five to eight minutes in hospital outpatient departments (Tai-Seale et al., 2007), substantially shorter than the fifteen to twenty minutes typical in the United States or the ten to fifteen minutes common in European systems. These compressed encounters reflect rational provider responses to payment incentives: when revenue per visit is capped by budgets, maintaining income requires higher patient volume. Hospital physicians routinely conduct forty to sixty outpatient consultations per half-day clinic session while simultaneously managing inpatient care, surgical procedures, and administrative responsibilities (Liu and Tsai, 2019).

This intensity contributes to documented physician burnout. Surveys indicate that 47% of hospital physicians report emotional exhaustion, with workload pressure cited as a primary contributor (Tsai et al., 2009). Burnout manifests not only as physician dissatisfaction but potentially affects patient interactions through reduced empathy, patience, and attentiveness. The combination of short consultation times and physician burnout creates conditions where interpersonal service quality may suffer despite universal access and low costs. Patients may feel rushed, unable to fully explain their concerns, or perceive physicians as inattentive or dismissive—experiences that likely generate complaints in online reviews despite occurring within a system that successfully provides universal, affordable access to care.

### Patient Empowerment Through System Design

Taiwan's NHI grants patients remarkable freedom in provider selection and care pathways. The absence of gatekeeping means patients can directly consult any specialist or visit any medical center without obtaining referrals from primary care physicians. Additionally, the system imposes no provider network restrictions—all NHI-contracted facilities (encompassing 95% of hospitals and clinics) accept the insurance, eliminating the in-network versus out-of-network distinction that constrains American patients. The NHI IC card, which stores basic medical information and facilitates claims processing, enhances portability by enabling patients to seamlessly switch between providers without administrative barriers (Wu et al., 2018).

This extensive patient agency produces both benefits and unintended consequences. Dissatisfied patients can readily exit relationships with underperforming providers, reducing patient lock-in and theoretically incentivizing providers to maintain quality through competitive pressure. However, this freedom also enables patterns of care that may not optimize health outcomes. The phenomenon of doctor shopping—where patients consult multiple providers for the same condition in rapid succession—affects approximately 23% of patients (Cheng, 2015). While this behavior could reflect legitimate second opinion seeking, it may also indicate trust deficits, unrealistic expectations, or patients pursuing symptom relief rather than appropriate diagnosis.

Furthermore, patients disproportionately seek care at major medical centers despite financial disincentives (higher copayments) designed to steer them toward primary care clinics. Approximately 60% of outpatient visits occur at hospitals rather than clinics, inverting the healthcare pyramid where primary care should handle most routine needs and hospitals address complex cases requiring specialized resources (Cheng, 2015). This preference reflects patient perceptions that medical centers offer superior quality—whether measured by physician expertise, diagnostic capabilities, or treatment outcomes—even for conditions manageable in primary care settings. These utilization patterns suggest that service quality evaluations in Taiwan may emphasize comparisons between facility types and hierarchical prestige, with patients judging community clinics against hospital standards rather than evaluating each level within appropriate expectations.

### Quality Monitoring and Accountability Mechanisms

Taiwan employs several quality oversight mechanisms, though these differ substantially from American approaches in transparency and patient accessibility. Hospital accreditation proceeds through the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation (TJCHA), which applies standards modeled on U.S. Joint Commission criteria, focusing on clinical processes, safety protocols, and organizational capacity. The NHIA has also implemented pay-for-performance programs that provide financial incentives for meeting specific quality metrics, particularly for chronic disease management in areas such as diabetes control, asthma care, and cardiovascular disease prevention (Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2021).

However, Taiwan lacks the systematic public reporting of patient experience measures that characterizes the American system through HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems). The TJCHA conducts patient satisfaction surveys as part of accreditation reviews, but these results receive limited public disclosure and do not inform patient choices as readily as publicly reported metrics might. This gap in standardized, comparable patient experience data elevates the potential value of online reviews as an alternative information source. Where American patients can consult official HCAHPS scores alongside online reviews, Taiwanese patients rely more heavily on informal information channels including word-of-mouth recommendations and increasingly, Google Maps reviews and similar online platforms.

The comparative research by Yi and colleagues (2015) on South Korea and Taiwan's universal health coverage systems highlights how different institutional arrangements within nominally similar single-payer frameworks affect quality and equity outcomes. While both countries achieved universal coverage from commercial insurance origins, Korea maintained multiple insurers before eventual consolidation, while Taiwan adopted a unified single-payer structure from the outset. Taiwan's unified approach appears to have generated more equitable access and simpler administration, though both systems face challenges in controlling utilization and managing provider payment mechanisms (Yi et al., 2015). This comparison underscores that even within the category of universal, single-payer systems, specific design choices regarding consolidation, payment methods, and regulatory authority significantly influence system performance and patient experiences.

### Implications for Service Quality Dimensions

The institutional characteristics of Taiwan's NHI system generate specific expectations for which service quality dimensions will prove salient in patient evaluations. Interpersonal quality—particularly communication adequacy, physician empathy, and feeling respected during consultations—likely emerges as a primary dimension given the structural constraints on consultation duration combined with cultural values emphasizing relational warmth (as established in Section 2.2). The tension between high patient volume and cultural expectations for empathetic care creates potential for expectation-disconfirmation that manifests in online complaints (Chang and Tung, 2024).

Wait times and crowding represent another expected prominent dimension, though framed differently than in access-constrained systems. Taiwanese patients likely complain not about inability to obtain appointments but rather about crowded waiting rooms, long waits on-site despite having appointments, and rushed interactions once consultation begins. Administrative efficiency in registration, payment processing, and medication pickup may also generate complaints, as high utilization frequency means patients repeatedly navigate these processes, amplifying irritation with inefficiencies (Wu et al., 2018).

Conversely, certain dimensions common in other systems should appear minimally or absent in Taiwanese evaluations. Cost and billing concerns should rarely surface given low copayments and simplified payment processes. Insurance coverage issues—prior authorization requirements, coverage denials, out-of-network charges—do not exist in Taiwan's unified system and therefore cannot generate complaints. These expected absences provide important contrasts when comparing Taiwan to the United States, where financial and insurance dimensions dominate patient concerns.

## 2.3.2 U.S. Healthcare System

### System Overview and Structural Characteristics

The United States stands alone among high-income nations in lacking universal health coverage, operating instead a fragmented pluralistic system that combines private insurance, multiple public programs, and significant uninsured populations. This complexity creates extraordinary variability in access, coverage, and quality depending on patients' insurance status, geographic location, and socioeconomic resources (Tikkanen et al., 2020). The system's fundamental characteristics reflect market-based organization rather than the centralized planning that characterizes Taiwan's NHI.

Private insurance predominates, with 54% of Americans obtaining coverage through employer-sponsored plans (2021 data). These employer plans feature enormous diversity in benefit design, cost-sharing requirements, and provider networks—a single large employer might offer employees five different plan options with varying premiums, deductibles, and covered services. Public programs cover an additional 35% of the population, primarily through Medicare (federal insurance for those aged 65 and older) and Medicaid (federal-state insurance for low-income individuals). Despite this coverage patchwork, approximately 9% of the population (27.5 million people) remained uninsured in 2021 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022). The Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, expanded coverage through Medicaid expansion and insurance marketplaces while implementing consumer protections such as prohibiting exclusions for preexisting conditions, but stopped short of establishing universal coverage (Tikkanen et al., 2020).

This multi-payer architecture generates fragmentation, administrative complexity, and perverse incentives that profoundly affect patient experiences. Unlike Taiwan's single set of rules and unified claims processing, American providers must navigate hundreds of different insurance plans, each with unique authorization requirements, covered services, payment rates, and appeals processes. Patients face parallel complexity in understanding their own coverage—what services require authorization, which providers are in-network, how much they will owe out-of-pocket—creating confusion and surprise bills that erode satisfaction even when clinical care meets expectations. Recent research on trauma-informed approaches in American primary healthcare highlights how system fragmentation particularly disadvantages vulnerable populations, including those with criminal justice involvement or histories of trauma, who face additional barriers navigating complex insurance and provider requirements (Lewis et al., 2023).

### Access Barriers and Coverage Gaps

Despite the highest per capita health expenditure globally (17.8% of GDP), the United States exhibits significant access barriers rooted in insurance inadequacy, provider shortages, and geographic maldistribution. The 27.5 million uninsured Americans face substantial obstacles obtaining non-emergency care, as most providers require payment or insurance verification before scheduling appointments. Even among the insured, underinsurance creates access problems—approximately 23% hold high-deductible health plans with individual deductibles of $1,400 or more, meaning they must pay substantial amounts before insurance contributes anything toward costs (Commonwealth Fund, 2020). For low-income families, these deductibles represent prohibitive barriers despite having "coverage."

Wait times for appointments compound access challenges in ways distinct from universally accessible systems. Primary care appointments for new patients average twenty-four days in major metropolitan areas, with specialist appointments requiring thirty to fifty days for fields such as dermatology, orthopedics, and cardiology (Merritt Hawkins, 2017). These delays reflect physician shortages exacerbated by insurance network limitations that reduce patients' available provider options. Geographic variation intensifies access problems, with rural areas experiencing severe physician scarcity—approximately 80% of U.S. counties carry official designations as Health Professional Shortage Areas (HRSA, 2021). Rural residents may travel hours for specialist consultations unavailable locally, creating access burdens absent in Taiwan's geographically compact system with dense provider networks.

Provider network restrictions further constrain patient choice despite America's nominally market-based system. Insurers contract with limited provider sets to negotiate lower prices and control utilization, creating "narrow networks" that exclude many physicians and hospitals. Patients selecting non-contracted providers face substantially higher out-of-pocket costs or complete denial of coverage. Studies indicate that 30% of insured adults report difficulty finding in-network specialists, while surprise out-of-network bills occur when patients unknowingly receive care from non-network providers, often during emergencies or when in-network facilities employ out-of-network physicians (Commonwealth Fund, 2020).

These access barriers directly shape which service quality dimensions appear salient in American patient evaluations. Appointment availability, wait times for consultations, and provider responsiveness to scheduling requests likely feature prominently—dimensions that Taiwanese patients take for granted given same-day access norms. Insurance-related problems including coverage denials, prior authorization delays, and network adequacy complaints permeate American healthcare experiences, manifesting in online reviews as patients vent frustration with administrative barriers to obtaining care. Selection bias also affects American reviews, as uninsured and severely underinsured patients underutilize care and thus generate fewer hospital reviews than well-insured patients, potentially masking the access barriers facing vulnerable populations.

### Cost Burden and Financial Barriers

The United States healthcare system imposes the highest costs globally on both the system and individual patients, creating financial stress that fundamentally shapes service quality perceptions. Per capita health spending reached $12,914 in 2021, representing two to three times expenditure in other high-income countries (OECD average: $5,428) (OECD Health Statistics, 2022). While national spending levels matter primarily for policy debates, patients experience costs through direct out-of-pocket payments and the constant anxiety about potential medical expenses.

Typical employer-sponsored insurance in 2021 required annual deductibles of $1,669 for individual coverage and $3,392 for family coverage before insurance began paying for most services (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2021). Beyond deductibles, patients face copayments ranging from $25-$50 for primary care visits, $40-$75 for specialists, and $350-$500 for emergency room visits. Hospitalization triggers coinsurance requirements where patients pay a percentage (typically 20%) of total costs after meeting deductibles—amounts that can reach thousands of dollars for major procedures or extended stays. Annual out-of-pocket maximums ($8,500 individual; $17,000 family) cap total patient liability, but these catastrophic thresholds exceed many families' liquid savings.

These cost structures create widespread financial hardship. Surveys document that 45% of American adults report delaying or forgoing needed medical care due to cost concerns (Commonwealth Fund, 2020). Catastrophic health expenditures, defined as spending exceeding 10% of household income, affect 21% of households (Papanicolas et al., 2018)—tenfold higher than Taiwan's 1.8% rate for the more stringent 40% of income threshold. Medical debt represents Americans' most common form of debt in collection, with 23% carrying medical debt, and medical expenses constitute the leading cause of personal bankruptcy even after the Affordable Care Act's reforms (Himmelstein et al., 2019).

This financial reality elevates cost considerations to a primary service quality dimension in American healthcare distinct from most other developed countries. Patients explicitly evaluate value-for-money, comparing perceived clinical benefit against financial burden—a calculation nearly absent from Taiwanese evaluations given low, predictable copayments. Billing clarity, price transparency, financial counseling quality, and surprise billing incidents likely dominate American patient reviews. Studies of Yelp hospital reviews confirm that billing disputes, surprise charges, and insurance processing problems appear frequently in American reviews, representing a quality dimension specific to high-cost, fragmented payment systems (Ranard et al., 2016). Unlike Taiwan where clinical and interpersonal quality can be evaluated independently of cost, American patients' satisfaction integrates financial experiences into overall quality assessments, creating an adversarial administrative dimension absent from unified, low-cost systems.

### Provider Behavior and Payment Reform

American healthcare payment has evolved from traditional fee-for-service toward value-based payment models, though this transition remains incomplete and uneven. Traditional fee-for-service, which still accounts for approximately 60% of physician payment, compensates providers per service delivered without regard to outcomes or efficiency. Historically, this incentivized overtreatment—ordering additional tests, scheduling more visits, performing more procedures—rather than maximizing patient volume as Taiwan's budget-constrained fee-for-service does. High per-service payment rates meant providers could maintain income without seeing excessive patient loads (Tikkanen et al., 2020).

Alternative payment models have attempted to shift incentives toward quality and efficiency. Managed care organizations and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) use capitation, paying providers fixed amounts per patient regardless of services delivered, theoretically incentivizing prevention and efficiency but risking undertreatment through care rationing. Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) under Medicare reward providers for meeting quality metrics and reducing costs through shared savings programs. Despite these reforms, payment complexity and insurance fragmentation persist, creating administrative burdens distinct from Taiwan's unified payment approach.

These payment dynamics affect consultation patterns and interpersonal quality differently than Taiwan's system. American physicians average fifteen to twenty minutes per patient visit (Tai-Seale et al., 2007), substantially longer than Taiwan's three to five minutes, enabling more thorough communication and potentially stronger patient-provider relationships. Daily patient volumes average fifteen to twenty-five patients versus Taiwan's forty to sixty, reducing time pressure and potentially improving interpersonal quality. However, prior authorization requirements, where insurers mandate pre-approval for tests, medications, and procedures, create administrative delays and care fragmentation. Physicians and staff spend substantial time documenting medical necessity, appealing denials, and navigating insurer policies—activities that delay care, frustrate both providers and patients, and represent common complaint sources in reviews.

Financial discussions permeate American healthcare encounters in ways absent from Taiwan. Providers must discuss costs, verify insurance coverage, explain patient financial responsibility, and arrange payment plans for high-cost services. These conversations, uncomfortable for both clinicians trained in medical care and patients anxious about affordability, introduce friction into relationships and potentially decrease satisfaction even when clinically appropriate care is delivered. The institutional imperative to discuss money transforms service encounters from purely therapeutic interactions into financial transactions, altering the nature of the patient-provider relationship in fundamental ways.

Recent research examining Medicaid expansion's effects on care quality suggests that insurance coverage alone, while necessary, proves insufficient for equitable, high-quality care without addressing systemic fragmentation and administrative complexity (Tikkanen et al., 2020). Studies of hospitals' differential treatment of Medicare versus Medicaid patients indicate that payment levels and administrative requirements affect provider behavior, with lower-paying Medicaid patients experiencing inferior access to specialists and advanced procedures even when nominally insured. These institutional effects interact with socioeconomic and racial disparities to create quality gaps that manifest in patient experiences and complaints.

### Patient Choice Within Constraints

The American healthcare system presents paradoxical patient choice: theoretically vast given thousands of hospitals and millions of physicians, but practically constrained by insurance networks, geographic limitations, and financial penalties for out-of-network care. Insurance network restrictions represent the most pervasive constraint, limiting patients to contracted providers without incurring substantial additional costs or complete coverage denial. Geographic access issues compound network limits, particularly in rural areas where residents may have only one nearby hospital regardless of insurance coverage. Referral requirements in many insurance plans mandate primary care gatekeeping, preventing direct specialist access without physician authorization.

Emergency situations eliminate patient choice entirely, with ambulances transporting patients to nearest facilities regardless of network status, frequently resulting in surprise out-of-network bills when receiving care at in-network hospitals staffed by out-of-network physicians. Recent federal regulations attempted to address surprise billing, but implementation challenges persist, leaving patients vulnerable to unexpected financial liability after emergency care.

Despite these constraints, American patients access more healthcare information than Taiwanese counterparts through multiple channels. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) operates Hospital Compare, publicly reporting HCAHPS patient experience scores, readmission rates, mortality rates, and safety indicators for all Medicare-participating hospitals. Private rating platforms including Yelp, Google, and Healthgrades host millions of patient reviews. New price transparency regulations (implemented 2021) require hospitals to publish prices, though compliance remains incomplete and information difficult for patients to interpret meaningfully.

This information availability creates expectations for healthcare shopping and comparison that differ from Taiwan's more relationship-based provider selection. American reviews may reference publicly reported quality metrics, compare hospitals explicitly, or discuss research undertaken before selecting providers. The tension between constrained choice (network limits) and abundant information (quality reports, reviews) generates frustration when patients identify preferred providers they cannot access due to insurance restrictions, manifesting in online complaints about network inadequacy and coverage denials.

### Quality Monitoring and Patient Experience Measurement

American healthcare maintains extensive quality measurement infrastructure unmatched globally in scope and standardization. The HCAHPS survey, mandatory for all hospitals receiving Medicare reimbursement, administers standardized questionnaires to patients after discharge, assessing communication with nurses and doctors, staff responsiveness, pain management, medication explanation, cleanliness, quietness, discharge information, and likelihood to recommend. Scores are publicly reported via Hospital Compare and incorporated into Medicare payment through value-based purchasing programs where low-scoring hospitals receive reduced reimbursement.

The Joint Commission accredits 82% of hospitals, with accreditation required for Medicare participation, focusing on clinical processes, safety protocols, and organizational capacity more than patient experience. Specialized organizations measure quality for specific conditions—the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) rates health plans, while the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) develops patient safety indicators and supports quality improvement research.

This measurement ecosystem shapes patient expectations and review content. HCAHPS domains may frame how patients conceptualize quality, with review language reflecting survey dimensions—communication, responsiveness, cleanliness—potentially through cultural diffusion as patients encounter these concepts in media coverage of hospital rankings. Online reviews complement official measures by capturing outpatient experiences (HCAHPS only surveys inpatients), providing narrative detail beyond numerical scores, and offering real-time feedback rather than lagged annual reports.

However, quality measurement emphasis on clinical processes and patient experience domains amenable to standardized surveys may overlook dimensions particularly important to vulnerable populations. Lewis and colleagues' (2023) research on trauma-informed approaches in primary care demonstrates that standard quality metrics inadequately capture whether healthcare delivery addresses social determinants of health, recognizes patients' trauma histories, or creates psychologically safe environments for marginalized populations. This gap between measured quality and experienced quality particularly affects patients with criminal justice involvement, housing instability, or mental health challenges who navigate healthcare systems not designed for their needs.

### Summary: Institutional Constraints Shaping American Healthcare Quality

The American healthcare system's institutional characteristics generate distinctive service quality dimensions and priorities. Cost and billing concerns, insurance coverage issues, access barriers, and care coordination problems represent system-specific dimensions absent from unified, universal coverage systems like Taiwan's. Longer consultation times and lower patient volumes potentially enable better interpersonal quality than Taiwan's high-volume model, though fragmentation and administrative burdens introduce different quality threats. The extensive quality measurement infrastructure creates transparency and accountability mechanisms lacking in Taiwan while potentially narrowing quality conceptualizations to readily measurable dimensions.

Expected prominent dimensions in American patient reviews include financial concerns (cost, billing, insurance), access challenges (appointment availability, wait times), care coordination across fragmented providers, and outcome-focused evaluations reflecting American transparency culture. Expected lower prominence dimensions include crowding and rushed consultations, given lower patient volumes and longer visit times compared to Taiwan's high-utilization system. The interaction between American individualist cultural values (Section 2.2) emphasizing autonomy and outcomes, and institutional realities of high costs and constrained access, likely produces distinctive quality configurations where financial and administrative dimensions achieve salience absent from other developed countries regardless of cultural orientation.

## 2.3.3 Institutional Context and Service Quality Dimensions

### Comparative Analysis: System-Level Differences

Taiwan's National Health Insurance and the United States healthcare system represent polar extremes among developed countries' healthcare organization. Taiwan achieves universal coverage through a unified, single-payer system with comprehensive benefits, minimal cost-sharing, and unrestricted provider choice. The United States maintains fragmented, multi-payer insurance with variable coverage, high cost-sharing, and network-restricted provider access. These fundamental structural differences create distinct patient experiences, priorities, and complaints that manifest in service quality evaluations independently of cultural factors.

Coverage universality versus fragmentation produces perhaps the most consequential divide. Taiwan's 99.9% enrollment rate eliminates insurance status as a patient concern—everyone has coverage, benefits are standardized, and no administrative barriers prevent care access based on coverage verification. American fragmentation means 9% lack insurance entirely while substantial proportions of the insured face underinsurance, creating access barriers and financial vulnerability. This difference predicts that insurance and coverage issues will dominate American reviews while rarely appearing in Taiwanese evaluations, representing an institutional rather than cultural effect.

Financial burden differences extend beyond coverage to encompass out-of-pocket costs. Taiwan's modest copayments ($5-$17 per visit) impose minimal financial burden, effectively decoupling cost from care-seeking decisions. American deductibles ($1,000-$5,000 annually), copayments ($25-$500), and coinsurance (20% of major costs) create substantial financial exposure. This institutional difference predicts cost and billing will feature prominently as quality dimensions in American reviews while remaining essentially absent from Taiwanese evaluations—patients cannot complain about costs they do not incur. The dramatically different catastrophic spending rates (1.8% of Taiwan households versus 21% of American households experiencing catastrophic expenditures) underscore how institutional financing shapes lived experiences and evaluation priorities.

Access patterns diverge between excess capacity generating crowding (Taiwan) and inadequate capacity creating wait times (United States). Taiwan's 14.2 visits per capita annually versus America's 4.0 visits reflects both coverage differences and supply factors—Taiwan maintains dense provider networks and eliminates gatekeeping, enabling instant access but creating crowded facilities. American patients face appointment waits averaging twenty-four days for primary care and thirty to fifty days for specialists despite lower per-capita utilization. These contrasting access problems predict that Taiwanese reviews emphasize crowding and rushed service while American reviews focus on appointment availability and scheduling difficulties—inverse manifestations of system capacity constraints.

Consultation duration differences derive from payment incentive structures. Taiwan's fee-for-service within global budgets incentivizes maximizing patient volume, producing three to five minute consultations. American fee-for-service without budget caps historically rewarded procedure volume over patient volume, enabling fifteen to twenty minute visits. This threefold to fourfold difference in consultation time directly affects communication quality potential—even perfectly empathetic physicians cannot adequately communicate in three minutes what requires fifteen minutes to explore. The interaction between cultural communication expectations (Section 2.2) and institutional time constraints amplifies quality gaps in Taiwan relative to the United States, predicting that rushed consultation and inadequate communication complaints feature more prominently in Taiwanese reviews despite cultural values favoring interpersonal warmth in both contexts.

Administrative burden manifests differently across systems. Taiwan's single-payer structure simplifies administration for patients—one insurance card, standardized coverage, automatic claims processing. American multi-payer complexity requires patients to understand deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, prior authorization requirements, network restrictions, and appeals processes across multiple plans. Prior authorization, where insurers mandate pre-approval for tests and treatments, represents a distinctly American administrative barrier absent from Taiwan's system. These differences predict administrative hassles and insurance-related complaints will pervade American reviews while Taiwan reviews focus on different administrative touchpoints such as registration efficiency and medication pickup convenience.

**Table 2.3: Healthcare System Comparison and Service Quality Implications**

### Interaction Between Culture and Institutions

Cultural and institutional effects do not operate independently; rather, they interact to produce system-specific service quality configurations. Understanding these interactions proves essential for interpreting cross-national differences in patient evaluations. Three interaction patterns illustrate how cultural expectations and institutional constraints combine to shape service quality dimensions and their salience.

The first interaction involves communication quality, consultation duration, and cultural expectations for interpersonal warmth. Section 2.2 established that collectivist cultures like Taiwan place higher relative importance on empathy and interpersonal dimensions than individualist cultures like the United States (Furrer et al., 2000). However, institutional analysis reveals that Taiwan's payment system constrains consultation duration to three to five minutes while American payment structures enable fifteen to twenty minutes. The interaction creates a larger expectation-disconfirmation gap in Taiwan than the United States. Taiwanese patients value communication warmth (cultural expectation) but cannot receive adequate communication in three-minute encounters (institutional constraint), creating perceived quality deficiencies more severe than cultural preferences alone would predict. Oliver's (1980) expectation-disconfirmation theory suggests that satisfaction derives not from expectation levels alone but from the gap between expectations and perceived performance—Taiwan's institutional constraints widen this gap relative to cultural expectations, predicting more severe communication complaints than the United States despite similar or lower expectations in absolute terms.

The second interaction addresses family involvement expectations and institutional accommodation. Collectivist Taiwan expects family participation in medical decisions and hospital care (Section 2.2), while American individualism emphasizes patient privacy and autonomous decision-making (Hofstede, 2001). However, Taiwan's healthcare institutions have adapted to these cultural norms through open visiting policies, family-friendly hospital designs, and provider acceptance of family presence during consultations (Wu et al., 2018). American hospitals, conversely, implement privacy regulations (HIPAA) and visiting restrictions aligned with individualist values but limiting family access even when patients desire involvement. This interaction suggests that family accommodation complaints may prove less frequent than cultural differences alone predict—Taiwanese institutional adaptation satisfies cultural expectations while American restrictions align with cultural preferences for privacy. The cultural-institutional alignment in both contexts, though producing opposite policies, reduces expectation-disconfirmation and associated complaints.

The third interaction involves cost consciousness, cultural instrumentalism, and institutional financial reality. Section 2.2 noted that individualist cultures may emphasize instrumental evaluations including cost-benefit analysis more than collectivist cultures. However, institutional cost differences overwhelm these cultural tendencies—American patients discuss cost extensively not primarily because individualist values prioritize cost-benefit calculation, but because institutional reality (high costs, variable coverage) forces cost consideration regardless of cultural orientation. Conversely, Taiwanese patients evaluate quality independent of cost not because collectivist values depreciate instrumental concerns, but because institutional reality (low, uniform costs) removes financial considerations from relevance. This interaction demonstrates that institutional factors can dominate cultural tendencies when structural constraints or enablers strongly shape feasible behaviors, predicting that cost salience differences reflect institutional effects more than cultural values.

Recent comparative research reinforces these interaction patterns. Yi and colleagues' (2015) analysis of South Korea and Taiwan's universal healthcare systems demonstrates that similar cultural contexts (both East Asian, collectivist, high power-distance) combined with similar institutional frameworks (universal, single-payer) nonetheless produce different outcomes when specific design choices vary. Korea's initial multi-insurer structure before consolidation created coordination problems and inequities absent from Taiwan's unified system from inception, illustrating how institutional details matter even within similar cultural-institutional categories. Similarly, Lewis and colleagues' (2023) research on trauma-informed care in American primary healthcare shows how institutional inertia—systems designed for different populations and problems—can prevent cultural adaptation to contemporary needs, creating quality gaps for vulnerable populations despite provider awareness of better practices.

### Hypothesized Institutional Effects on Service Quality Dimensions

Integrating institutional analysis with cultural expectations (Section 2.2) and accounting for culture-institution interactions, we propose five institutional hypotheses predicting how system-level factors shape service quality dimensions in patient reviews.

**Institutional Hypothesis 1 (Cost and Billing Dimension)**: A distinct cost, billing, and insurance dimension will emerge prominently in American reviews but be absent or minimal in Taiwanese reviews. This hypothesis derives from the dramatic difference in patient financial exposure—American high-deductible plans, copayments, and surprise billing create financial stress and disputes absent from Taiwan's low-copayment, unified system. Financial toxicity research demonstrates that American healthcare costs generate anxiety, debt, and care avoidance (Himmelstein et al., 2019), predicting these concerns manifest in quality evaluations. Taiwan's catastrophic spending protection (affecting only 1.8% of households) versus America's widespread financial hardship (21% experiencing catastrophic expenses) suggests institutional financing shapes whether cost constitutes a service quality dimension or remains background context taken for granted.

**Institutional Hypothesis 2 (Access Barriers vs. Crowding)**: American reviews will emphasize appointment access, wait times for appointments, and provider availability more than Taiwanese reviews, while Taiwanese reviews will emphasize crowding, waiting room waits, and rushed service more than American reviews. This hypothesis reflects inverse system capacity problems—American under-capacity (relative to demand) creates appointment delays while Taiwan's adequate capacity with unrestricted access creates crowding. The differential patient volumes (Taiwan's 14.2 visits/year versus U.S. 4.0 visits/year) and appointment wait times (Taiwan same-day versus U.S. multi-week waits) predict fundamentally different access complaints despite both systems experiencing access-related quality problems.

**Institutional Hypothesis 3 (Communication Quality Prominence)**: Taiwanese reviews will emphasize communication quality and rushed consultations more than American reviews. This hypothesis combines institutional time constraints (three to five minute versus fifteen to twenty minute consultations) with cultural expectations for communication warmth (collectivism valuing interpersonal dimensions). The interaction between high communication expectations and severe time constraints creates larger perceived quality gaps in Taiwan than the United States. Empirical research documenting consultation duration differences (Tai-Seale et al., 2007) and physician burnout from volume pressure (Tsai et al., 2009) provides institutional mechanisms explaining why Taiwanese patients, despite valuing communication, might complain more frequently about communication inadequacy than Americans.

**Institutional Hypothesis 4 (Administrative Processes)**: American reviews will discuss prior authorization delays, referral difficulties, and insurance claim problems, while Taiwanese reviews will discuss registration efficiency and medication pickup logistics. This hypothesis recognizes that administrative burdens differ qualitatively across systems—American multi-payer complexity creates authorization and claims challenges while Taiwan's high-frequency utilization makes registration and prescription retrieval repetitive irritants. Both systems impose administrative burdens, but the nature of these burdens differs according to system structure, predicting different administrative complaints despite both populations experiencing bureaucratic frustration.

**Institutional Hypothesis 5 (Care Coordination)**: American reviews will discuss care coordination failures—information not transferred between providers, contradictory advice from different specialists, lack of integrated treatment plans—more than Taiwanese reviews. This hypothesis reflects American healthcare fragmentation across insurers, health systems, and provider organizations lacking integrated information systems, compared to Taiwan's NHI IC card facilitating information portability and unified data architecture (Cheng, 2015). American research documents widespread coordination problems costing billions annually and generating patient complaints (Tikkanen et al., 2020), predicting these issues manifest in reviews more prominently than in Taiwan's more integrated system.

### A Three-Level Model of Service Quality Dimensions

Synthesizing universal healthcare characteristics, cultural influences, and institutional factors yields a three-level model explaining service quality dimensional emergence and variation. This model provides a framework for interpreting LDA results by predicting which dimensions should appear universally, which should vary in relative importance across cultures, and which should uniquely emerge from specific institutional contexts.

Level 1 encompasses universal healthcare characteristics—dimensions common across all healthcare systems because they derive from inherent features of medical care delivery. The clinical consultation process including diagnosis, examination, and treatment explanation appears universally as patients everywhere require effective clinical encounters. Physical environment quality including cleanliness, facilities, and equipment condition affects all patients' comfort and perceptions of safety. Basic interpersonal interactions involving courtesy, respect, and human dignity represent universal human needs in healthcare encounters. These dimensions should appear in both Taiwan and American reviews because they reflect fundamental healthcare service components independent of cultural values or institutional arrangements. However, relative importance may vary—physical environment might feature more prominently in American reviews given higher service expectations from expensive healthcare, while interpersonal interactions might weigh more heavily in Taiwanese evaluations given collectivist emphases on relational quality.

Level 2 captures cultural influences shaping dimensional importance and culture-specific dimensions. Section 2.2 established how Hofstede's cultural dimensions predict service quality priorities: collectivism emphasizes empathy and warmth, individualism prioritizes reliability and outcomes, power distance affects physician authority expectations, and uncertainty avoidance influences information needs. Cultural effects predict that universal dimensions receive differential weighting—empathy features more prominently in Taiwanese evaluations while efficiency and outcomes receive greater emphasis in American reviews. Additionally, culture-specific dimensions emerge in certain contexts but not others. Family involvement and accommodation represent meaningful quality dimensions in collectivist Taiwan but not individualist America where family presence might constitute privacy violation rather than service enhancement. Communication directness varies culturally, with Taiwanese patients potentially using indirect criticism and hedging while American patients employ blunt, explicit feedback. Cultural influences explain why identical service delivery might generate different evaluations and why some quality dimensions exist in one culture but lack meaning in another.

Level 3 incorporates institutional influences from healthcare system structure, financing, and regulation. System-specific dimensions emerge from institutional realities unique to particular healthcare architectures. Cost and billing represent salient dimensions in American high-cost, multi-payer systems but not in Taiwanese low-cost, unified systems. Access manifests as appointment delays in capacity-constrained American settings but as crowding in Taiwan's high-utilization environment. Administrative processes differ qualitatively—prior authorization in America, registration efficiency in Taiwan—creating distinct bureaucratic complaint types. Consultation duration, shaped by payment incentives, affects communication quality potential, with Taiwan's volume-driven brief encounters generating more communication complaints than America's longer visits despite similar cultural communication preferences.

Critically, Level 3 institutional factors can amplify, suppress, or transform Level 2 cultural expectations. Taiwan's cultural valuation of communication warmth amplified by institutional time pressure creates critical communication quality complaints more severe than cultural preferences alone predict. America's individualist preference for autonomy potentially suppressed by insurance network restrictions might generate frustrated complaints about constrained choice. Institutional enabling or constraining factors interact with cultural expectations to produce experienced quality and its evaluation, suggesting that cultural and institutional effects cannot be simply additive but rather combine multiplicatively in producing service quality dimensions and their perceived importance.

### Research Questions Refined Through Institutional Analysis

Integrating cultural foundations (Section 2.2) with institutional analysis enables refined research questions that guide empirical LDA analysis and interpretation. These questions explicitly recognize that service quality dimensions emerge from multiple levels of influence requiring multilevel explanation.

**RQ1 (Descriptive)**: What service quality dimensions emerge from Taiwan and American hospital reviews when applying LDA topic modeling? This question adopts an inductive stance, allowing dimensions to emerge from patient narratives rather than imposing predetermined structures. The three-level model predicts mixtures of universal dimensions (appearing in both countries), culturally weighted universal dimensions (present in both but differentially important), culture-specific dimensions (appearing in one context only), and institution-specific dimensions (unique to particular healthcare systems).

**RQ2 (Comparative)**: How do dimensional structures differ between Taiwan and the United States in terms of which dimensions are universal (appear in both), country-specific (unique to one context), and differentially prominent (present in both but varying in importance)? This question operationalizes comparison by categorizing emergent dimensions according to cross-national patterns, enabling systematic assessment of similarity versus difference in service quality frameworks.

**RQ3 (Explanatory)**: Can observed differences be explained by cultural factors (Hofstede's dimensions, collectivism/individualism), institutional factors (healthcare system structure, financing, access), or interaction effects (culture × institutions)? This question addresses why dimensional differences exist, testing whether cultural theories, institutional theories, or their interactions better account for empirical patterns. Disentangling cultural from institutional effects requires examining whether differences align with cultural predictions, institutional predictions, or emerge from their combination as interaction hypotheses suggest.

**RQ4 (Methodological)**: Does the inductive, data-driven LDA approach reveal dimensions not captured by Western-developed survey instruments (SERVQUAL, HCAHPS), particularly in the Taiwan context? This question recognizes potential cultural and institutional bias in existing measurement instruments developed in Western, market-based healthcare systems. Dimensions like family accommodation or registration efficiency might constitute important quality components in Taiwan but remain unmeasured by surveys designed for American patients. Identifying such measurement gaps validates inductive text mining methods while revealing healthcare quality constructs overlooked by dominant Western frameworks.

These refined questions guide subsequent sections: Section 2.4 reviews online reviews as data sources for capturing patient-reported quality, while Section 2.5 examines LDA methodology for discovering latent dimensional structures from narrative text. The integrated cultural-institutional framework developed across Sections 2.2 and 2.3 provides theoretical expectations that empirical analysis can test, confirm, or challenge, enabling theory-informed interpretation of inductively discovered patterns.

## Summary: Institutional Foundations for Cross-Cultural Comparison

This section establishes that Taiwan's National Health Insurance and America's market-based healthcare system represent polar extremes in healthcare organization, financing, and delivery. Taiwan achieves universal single-payer coverage with comprehensive benefits, minimal costs, unrestricted choice, but extremely short consultations and high provider volume driven by payment incentives. The United States maintains fragmented multi-payer insurance with variable coverage, high costs, network restrictions, but longer consultations and lower volume reflecting different payment structures (Cheng, 2015; Tikkanen et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2018). Comparative research on other East Asian universal healthcare systems, particularly South Korea, demonstrates that even within similar cultural and institutional categories, specific design choices regarding consolidation, payment, and regulation significantly affect outcomes and experiences (Yi et al., 2015).

Institutional structures shape patient experiences independently of cultural values. American patients face cost burdens and insurance complexity regardless of cultural orientation toward instrumental evaluation; Taiwanese patients experience crowding and rushed care regardless of collectivist preferences for relational harmony. These system-level factors predict that cost and insurance complaints dominate American reviews while remaining absent from Taiwanese evaluations, that access complaints emphasize appointment delays in America versus crowding in Taiwan, and that administrative frustrations differ qualitatively between prior authorization (America) and registration efficiency (Taiwan) despite both populations experiencing bureaucratic burdens.

Culture and institutions interact rather than operating independently. Taiwan's cultural valuation of empathy combined with institutional time constraints creates magnified communication quality gaps; American institutional cost burdens may overwhelm cultural preferences for other quality dimensions; family involvement expectations find institutional accommodation in both contexts but through opposite policies (open access Taiwan versus restricted access America). These interactions suggest that service quality dimensions and their salience emerge from culture-institution combinations rather than additive cultural plus institutional effects (Lewis et al., 2023; Oliver, 1980).

Five institutional hypotheses predict system-specific dimensions: cost/billing prominence in America (IH1), inverse access problems with American appointment delays versus Taiwanese crowding (IH2), greater communication quality salience in Taiwan despite cultural warmth valuation (IH3), qualitatively different administrative complaints (IH4), and American care coordination problems from fragmentation (IH5). A three-level model incorporating universal healthcare dimensions, cultural influences, and institutional factors provides a comprehensive framework for interpreting LDA results, explaining which dimensions should appear universally, vary culturally, or emerge from specific system structures. Recent research on trauma-informed care in American settings and comparative analysis of Asian universal healthcare systems reinforces how institutional inertia and design details shape whether systems effectively address contemporary populations' needs regardless of provider awareness or cultural values (Lewis et al., 2023; Yi et al., 2015).

With cultural foundations (Section 2.2) and institutional analysis (Section 2.3) established, subsequent sections address online reviews as a data source for patient-reported quality (Section 2.4) and text mining methodologies, particularly LDA, for discovering service quality dimensions from patient narratives (Section 2.5). The integrated theoretical framework guides empirical analysis, enabling theory-informed interpretation of inductively discovered patterns while remaining open to dimensions not predicted by existing cultural or institutional theories.
