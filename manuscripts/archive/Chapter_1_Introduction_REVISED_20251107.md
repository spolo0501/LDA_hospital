# Chapter 1: Introduction

Healthcare service quality remains one of the most pressing challenges facing health systems worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, inadequate quality of care contributes to millions of preventable patient harms annually, with significant variations observed across countries and healthcare systems (WHO, 2020). While substantial research has examined healthcare quality within individual nations, a critical question remains largely unanswered: Do patients in different healthcare systems—particularly those with fundamentally different organizational structures—prioritize the same service quality dimensions? Understanding these cross-national patterns is essential for identifying universal healthcare challenges that transcend system boundaries, as well as system-specific and culture-specific concerns that require tailored interventions.

The contrast between Taiwan's single-payer National Health Insurance system and the United States' multi-payer, market-based system provides an ideal natural experiment for examining how healthcare system structure influences patient quality perceptions. Although both nations achieve high healthcare outcomes by international standards, their patients navigate vastly different care delivery and financing mechanisms. Whether these structural differences translate into divergent patient priorities regarding service quality remains an empirical question with significant theoretical and practical implications. Taiwan's NHI system provides universal coverage through a government-administered insurance program with standardized fee schedules, effectively removing financial barriers to healthcare access. In contrast, the U.S. system operates through a complex mix of private insurance, employer-sponsored plans, and government programs (Medicare, Medicaid), creating substantial variation in coverage, out-of-pocket costs, and access barriers. These fundamental structural differences may shape not only healthcare access and clinical outcomes, but also which aspects of service quality become salient to patients.

Traditional healthcare quality assessment relies predominantly on structured instruments such as SERVQUAL (Parasuraman et al., 1988) and healthcare-adapted variants (Dagger et al., 2007). While these instruments provide standardized measurement, they suffer from systematic limitations that are particularly problematic in cross-cultural research. First, researcher-imposed frameworks constrain patient expression to predetermined dimensions that may not capture culture-specific priorities or emerging concerns (Carman, 1990). Second, cross-cultural translation introduces measurement non-equivalence, with survey items carrying different connotations across languages and response styles varying systematically by culture (Harzing, 2006). Third, social desirability bias may suppress honest criticism, particularly in cultures emphasizing social harmony and respect for authority. Finally, the temporal lag between survey design and data collection means findings may be outdated before publication, especially problematic in rapidly evolving healthcare systems.

The proliferation of online patient reviews on platforms like Google Maps presents methodological opportunities to address these limitations. These unsolicited patient narratives offer several advantages: authenticity (no researcher prompting or framing), immediacy (real-time patient sentiment), scale (thousands of reviews enabling robust statistical analysis), cross-cultural comparability (identical platform mechanisms across countries), and richness (contextual details and emotional intensity often absent from structured surveys) (Ranard et al., 2016). However, extracting service quality dimensions from massive volumes of unstructured, multilingual narratives requires analytical methods that avoid imposing predetermined frameworks while enabling rigorous cross-national comparison.

Three critical gaps constrain theoretical advancement and practical application. First, existing healthcare quality research remains predominantly single-country in focus, with limited cross-national studies employing different methodologies across countries that make direct comparison problematic (Fung et al., 2008). No prior study has applied identical analytical methods to comparable patient-generated data across drastically different healthcare systems (single-payer versus multi-payer) to identify both universal and system-specific quality dimensions. Second, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)—an unsupervised machine learning approach that extracts latent themes from large text corpora without researcher-imposed categories (Blei et al., 2003)—remains underutilized in healthcare contexts and exceedingly rare in cross-lingual applications. While increasingly applied to hospitality and retail service reviews, no prior study has developed a systematic framework for applying LDA across Chinese and English hospital reviews to enable semantic mapping and cross-cultural comparison. Third, service quality theory contains a fundamental unresolved tension: Are quality dimensions universal across cultures and contexts, or are they fundamentally shaped by cultural values and system structures (Brady and Cronin, 2001)? While conceptual arguments exist on both sides, empirical evidence remains limited and contradictory. What remains absent is empirical quantification of which specific dimensions transcend system boundaries (representing universal challenges) versus which emerge uniquely from particular healthcare structures or cultural contexts (representing system-specific concerns).

This study addresses these three gaps through a comparative analysis of patient reviews from Taiwan and the United States. We pose three research questions: (1) What service quality dimensions emerge from patient reviews of hospitals in Taiwan versus the United States when analyzed using identical unsupervised topic modeling methods? (2) Which service quality dimensions represent universal concerns that transcend healthcare system structures, and which are system-specific or culture-specific? (3) How do different healthcare system structures (single-payer vs. multi-payer) influence the composition and relative importance of patient satisfaction determinants?

To answer these questions, we collected 5,007 patient reviews from Taiwan's 26 top-tier medical centers and 3,240 reviews from 28 leading U.S. hospitals, all obtained from Google Maps. We applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling independently to each language corpus, selecting optimal topic numbers (K=7 for Taiwan, K=6 for the United States) through an integrated framework balancing statistical coherence, semantic interpretability, and theoretical alignment with established service quality frameworks. We then conducted cross-lingual semantic mapping to identify universal dimensions (appearing in both countries) and system-specific dimensions (appearing in only one country), assessing semantic similarity through keyword analysis, representative text examination, and expert judgment. For dimensions achieving high semantic similarity, we performed statistical hypothesis testing to quantify cross-national differences in prevalence and satisfaction ratings. This methodological approach enables us to identify which service quality dimensions transcend system boundaries and which emerge from specific institutional or cultural contexts, while avoiding the imposition of predetermined Western frameworks on non-Western patient discourse.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Chapter 2 reviews relevant literature on service quality theory, cross-cultural healthcare research, healthcare systems comparison, online reviews as data sources, and topic modeling applications. Chapter 3 details our data collection procedures, text preprocessing for Chinese and English corpora, LDA modeling approach, cross-lingual semantic mapping protocol, and statistical testing methods. Chapter 4 presents extracted quality dimensions for each country, cross-national comparisons revealing universal and system-specific patterns, and statistical hypothesis tests. Chapter 5 discusses theoretical implications, practical recommendations, methodological contributions, and study limitations. Chapter 6 concludes with summary contributions and directions for future research.
