# 2.1 Healthcare Service Quality: Theoretical Foundations

## 2.1.1 Service Quality Dimensions and Frameworks

### The Multidimensional Nature of Service Quality

Service quality has been recognized as a multidimensional construct since the seminal work of Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1985), who conceptualized it as "the gap between customer expectations and perceptions of service delivery." This gap model laid the foundation for understanding that service quality cannot be reduced to a single global evaluation but rather comprises distinct, evaluable dimensions that collectively shape customer assessments.

**SERVQUAL: The Foundational Framework**

The most influential operationalization of service quality emerged through the SERVQUAL instrument (Parasuraman et al., 1988), which identified five generic dimensions—tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy—applicable across service industries. This 22-item scale revolutionized service quality research by providing standardized, psychometrically validated measurement applicable across banking (Avkiran, 1994), retail (Dabholkar et al., 1996), and telecommunications (Kettinger and Lee, 1994). Recent applications have extended SERVQUAL to healthcare systems in East Africa (Msacky, 2024) and South Asia (Pakdil et al., 2012), affirming cross-cultural applicability while revealing context-specific adaptations. The underlying premise—that service quality comprises multiple evaluable dimensions rather than a global perception—has achieved paradigmatic status in service research (Brady and Cronin, 2001).

However, SERVQUAL faces persistent critiques. Cronin and Taylor (1992) demonstrated that performance-only measures (SERVPERF) predict service quality more effectively than gap scores, challenging SERVQUAL's theoretical foundation. Buttle (1996) noted that factor analyses across contexts yield inconsistent dimensional structures (ranging from 3 to 9 factors), questioning the universal five-factor model. Most critically, generic dimensions may inadequately capture industry-specific attributes (Dagger et al., 2007) or contemporary priorities such as digital service delivery (Lin et al., 2024) and person-centred care (Giusti et al., 2020), motivating context-adapted frameworks.

### Healthcare-Specific Service Quality Models

Recognizing the limitations of generic frameworks, researchers have developed healthcare-adapted service quality models that account for the unique characteristics of medical service delivery.

**Donabedian's Structure-Process-Outcome Framework**

The foundational healthcare quality framework remains Donabedian's (1988) tripartite model, which conceptualizes quality assessment across structure (organizational attributes: facilities, equipment, staffing), process (care delivery activities: clinical procedures, patient interactions), and outcome (effects on health status: clinical results, patient satisfaction). This framework has proven remarkably enduring, with contemporary applications spanning antenatal care quality in Ethiopia (Defar et al., 2020) and interdisciplinary chronic care in Germany (Romeyke et al., 2020). The model's persistence reflects its fundamental insight that healthcare quality must be evaluated across multiple interdependent levels—from structural capacity to deliver care, through care delivery processes, to health outcomes achieved.

**Brady and Cronin's Hierarchical Model**

Brady and Cronin (2001) proposed a hierarchical conceptualization decomposing service quality into three primary dimensions—interaction quality, physical environment quality, and outcome quality—each comprising three sub-dimensions (e.g., interaction quality encompasses staff attitude, behavior, and expertise). This hierarchical structure distinguishes between process (how service is delivered) and outcome (what is delivered), a distinction particularly salient in healthcare where patients often lack technical expertise to evaluate clinical outcomes but readily assess interpersonal interactions and environmental conditions (Donabedian, 1988). The model's multi-level architecture reconciles debates about dimensional granularity: higher-order dimensions (interaction, environment, outcome) provide parsimonious theoretical constructs, while sub-dimensions enable detailed operational measurement.

**Dagger et al.'s Healthcare Service Quality Model**

Dagger, Sweeney, and Johnson (2007) developed a healthcare-specific model through qualitative patient interviews, identifying four dimensions: interpersonal quality (staff empathy, communication), technical quality (clinical competence, diagnostic accuracy), environment quality (facility cleanliness, comfort), and administrative quality (scheduling efficiency, billing processes). Empirical validation revealed differential impacts on patient satisfaction and behavioral intentions, with interpersonal quality emerging as the strongest predictor of patient loyalty even when controlling for technical quality—underscoring the "high-touch" relational nature of healthcare services despite the primacy of medical outcomes.

**Person-Centred Care: An Emerging Quality Paradigm**

Recent healthcare quality research increasingly emphasizes person-centred care (PCC) as a critical attribute of high-quality healthcare. Giusti et al.'s (2020) systematic review identified six core PCC dimensions extending beyond traditional service quality frameworks: respect for patient dignity and preferences, comprehensive information sharing to enable informed decisions, patient and family participation in care decisions, holistic support addressing physical-psychological-social-existential needs, continuity of care across healthcare encounters, and integration of family and social networks in care delivery. Critically, PCC operationalization requires attention to patient and family perspectives, management of clinical uncertainty, high-quality communication, and delivery of care concordant with patient preferences—dimensions inadequately captured by traditional SERVQUAL constructs. The emergence of PCC reflects healthcare's evolution from provider-centric to patient-centric models, with implications for how quality dimensions are conceptualized and measured in contemporary research.

**The Technical-Functional Quality Dichotomy**

Building on Grönroos' (1984) foundational distinction, healthcare researchers have extensively studied how technical and functional quality independently and jointly influence patient outcomes. Technical quality (clinical quality) refers to the accuracy and appropriateness of medical diagnosis, treatment, and procedures, including adherence to evidence-based protocols, clinical outcomes such as infection and readmission rates, and professional competence—essentially what Donabedian (1988) termed "outcome quality" or the actual health improvement achieved. Functional quality (service delivery quality) encompasses the manner in which healthcare is delivered: interpersonal interactions including communication, empathy, and respect; administrative processes such as appointment scheduling, wait times, and billing; and physical environment attributes including facility cleanliness, comfort, and equipment modernity—corresponding to Donabedian's "process quality."

This dichotomy is theoretically crucial because it reflects the information asymmetry inherent in healthcare: patients typically lack the medical expertise to evaluate technical quality (e.g., whether a diagnosis was clinically accurate) but can readily assess functional aspects (e.g., whether the physician listened empathetically) (Andaleeb, 2001). Consequently, patient satisfaction and service quality perceptions are often disproportionately influenced by functional quality, even when technical quality is objectively high (Chang et al., 2013). This asymmetry creates a substitution effect wherein patients rely on observable functional attributes as proxy indicators of unobservable technical quality—if a physician spends substantial time explaining a diagnosis, patients infer clinical competence; if a hospital is immaculate, patients assume surgical precision. Empirical evidence demonstrates that while technical quality matters more for objective health outcomes, functional quality exerts stronger influence on patient satisfaction and behavioral intentions such as provider loyalty and willingness to recommend (Dagger et al., 2007).

### Comparative Analysis of Service Quality Frameworks

While consensus exists that healthcare service quality is multidimensional, frameworks differ substantially in dimensional structure, focus, and application context. Table 2.1 synthesizes five major frameworks that have shaped contemporary quality research, revealing both convergence and divergence in how quality is conceptualized.

**[Table 2.1 near here: Comparison of Healthcare Service Quality Frameworks]**

| Framework | Dimensions | Core Focus | Healthcare Specificity | Key Contribution |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **SERVQUAL** (Parasuraman et al., 1988) | 5: Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, Empathy | Gap between expectations and perceptions | Generic (applied to healthcare) | Standardized measurement; cross-industry applicability |
| **Donabedian** (1988) | 3: Structure, Process, Outcome | System-level quality assessment | Healthcare-specific | Links organizational capacity to care delivery to health outcomes |
| **Brady & Cronin** (2001) | 3 primary + 9 sub-dimensions: Interaction Quality, Physical Environment, Outcome Quality | Hierarchical decomposition of quality | Service-general (validated in healthcare) | Distinguishes process vs. outcome; multi-level structure |
| **Dagger et al.** (2007) | 4: Interpersonal, Technical, Environment, Administrative | Patient-experienced service quality | Healthcare-specific (developed from patient interviews) | Separates technical and interpersonal dimensions; administrative processes |
| **Person-Centred Care** (Giusti et al., 2020) | 6: Respect/Dignity, Information, Participation, Holistic Support, Continuity, Family Inclusion | Patient autonomy and holistic wellbeing | Healthcare-specific (serious illness contexts) | Patient agency; family integration; care continuity across encounters |

Three patterns emerge from this comparison. First, **dimensional granularity varies with framework purpose**: system-level models (Donabedian) employ broader constructs (structure, process, outcome), while patient-experience models (Dagger et al.) decompose quality into finer-grained attributes (interpersonal manner, administrative efficiency). Second, **temporal evolution reflects paradigm shifts**: frameworks developed in the 1980s-1990s (SERVQUAL, Donabedian) emphasize provider capabilities and service delivery processes, whereas contemporary frameworks (PCC) foreground patient autonomy, shared decision-making, and social networks—reflecting healthcare's transition from paternalistic to collaborative care models. Third, **contextual adaptation is essential**: cross-cultural applications reveal that dimensional salience varies by healthcare system characteristics, with resource-limited settings prioritizing structural readiness (Defar et al., 2020) and resource-rich settings emphasizing patient-centredness (Giusti et al., 2020).

These divergent frameworks are not competing alternatives but rather complementary lenses addressing different facets of quality. Donabedian's structure-process-outcome logic operates at the health system level, informing policy and organizational design. SERVQUAL and Dagger et al. assess service encounters from patient perspectives, guiding frontline service improvements. Person-centred care addresses the longitudinal patient journey, emphasizing care coordination and relational continuity. The appropriate framework depends on the evaluative purpose: quality assessment for accreditation may employ Donabedian's systemic approach, patient satisfaction monitoring may use SERVQUAL dimensions, and care redesign initiatives may adopt PCC principles.

### Implications for the Present Study

The preceding review informs our research design in several critical ways. First, the universal recognition that service quality is multidimensional—whether conceptualized through Donabedian's (1988) tripartite model, SERVQUAL's five-factor structure (Parasuraman et al., 1988), or person-centred care's six principles (Giusti et al., 2020)—establishes that any valid quality assessment must capture multiple distinct evaluative criteria rather than relying on global ratings. Our use of topic modeling aligns with this consensus by inductively discovering latent quality dimensions embedded in patient narratives.

Second, the demonstrated context-specificity of quality dimensions justifies exploratory rather than confirmatory approaches for cross-cultural research. Empirical evidence shows that quality structures vary across healthcare systems (Msacky, 2024; Defar et al., 2020), cultural contexts (Dagger et al., 2007), and historical periods—the COVID-19 pandemic introduced entirely new dimensions (infection control, telemedicine) absent from pre-2020 frameworks. Imposing SERVQUAL's predetermined five dimensions on Taiwan and U.S. hospital reviews would assume dimensional equivalence where it may not exist. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) offers a data-driven alternative, allowing quality dimensions to emerge from patient discourse rather than being researcher-imposed.

Third, the evolution toward patient-centredness (Giusti et al., 2020) supports using unsolicited patient reviews as primary data. Unlike survey research where respondents evaluate predetermined attributes, online reviews capture patients' spontaneous priorities—what aspects of care they found sufficiently important to publicly discuss. This methodological approach privileges patient voices in defining quality constructs, consistent with person-centred care principles. Moreover, as Giusti et al. (2020) and Dugstad et al. (2019) demonstrate, exploratory qualitative methods continue to identify dimensions overlooked by standardized instruments, suggesting that patient-generated narratives may reveal emergent quality concerns (e.g., racial equity, digital access) not captured in surveys designed before these issues gained salience.

Finally, recognizing that frameworks address different quality facets at different analytical levels (Table 2.1) clarifies that our study examines **patient-experienced service quality** at the encounter level—the domain addressed by Dagger et al. (2007) and SERVQUAL—rather than system-level quality (Donabedian) or longitudinal care continuity (PCC). This scoping focuses our LDA analysis on discovering what quality dimensions patients perceive and evaluate during and immediately following hospital encounters, as reflected in online reviews typically posted within days of service experiences.

## 2.1.2 Context-Specific Service Quality in Healthcare

### The Unique Characteristics of Healthcare Services

Healthcare services possess distinctive features that differentiate them from other service sectors and necessitate context-adapted quality frameworks (Berry and Bendapudi, 2007). These characteristics fundamentally shape how patients perceive, evaluate, and prioritize service quality dimensions.

**1. High-Contact, High-Stakes Interactions**

Healthcare delivery involves **intensive interpersonal contact** between patients and providers (physicians, nurses, technicians) over extended periods, often during moments of physical distress or emotional vulnerability (Berry and Bendapudi, 2007). Unlike a routine retail transaction, a medical consultation involves:

- **Information exchange**: Patients must disclose intimate personal information (symptoms, medical history, lifestyle factors)
- **Trust requirements**: Patients must trust providers with their physical wellbeing and, in severe cases, their lives
- **Emotional labor**: Providers must manage patients' anxiety, fear, and uncertainty while delivering technically accurate information

This high-contact nature means that **interpersonal quality**—how providers communicate, show empathy, and build rapport—assumes disproportionate importance in healthcare compared to low-contact services like online banking (Dagger et al., 2007). Empirical evidence consistently shows that physician communication style and nursing staff courtesy are among the strongest predictors of patient satisfaction, often exceeding the influence of clinical outcomes (Ware et al., 1983; Clever et al., 2008).

**2. Information Asymmetry and Credence Qualities**

Healthcare services are characterized by extreme **information asymmetry**: patients typically lack the medical knowledge to evaluate the technical quality of diagnosis and treatment (Andaleeb, 2001). In economic terms, healthcare is a **credence good**—a product whose quality cannot be fully assessed even after consumption (Darby and Karni, 1973).

Consider a patient diagnosed with hypertension:
- The patient cannot independently verify whether the diagnosis is accurate
- The patient cannot assess whether the prescribed medication is optimal among alternatives
- Even after treatment, the patient may not know if health improvement resulted from the medication or other factors

This asymmetry creates a **substitution effect**: patients rely on **observable, functional attributes** (e.g., physician attentiveness, facility cleanliness, wait times) as **proxy indicators** of unobservable technical quality (Andaleeb, 2001). If a doctor spends 20 minutes explaining a diagnosis thoroughly, patients infer high competence; if a hospital is spotless, patients assume surgical precision.

This has profound implications for service quality assessment: **functional quality often dominates technical quality in patient evaluations**, not because functional aspects are objectively more important for health outcomes, but because they are more observable and thus more influential in shaping patient perceptions (Donabedian, 1988).

**3. Outcome Uncertainty and Risk**

Medical outcomes are inherently uncertain. Even with excellent care, patients may not recover; conversely, patients may improve despite suboptimal care due to natural healing processes (Berry and Bendapudi, 2007). This **outcome uncertainty** complicates quality assessment in two ways:

First, patients cannot reliably use **outcome quality** (health improvement) to infer **process quality** (medical care). A patient who recovers may still rate service poorly if they experienced long wait times or rude staff; a patient whose condition worsens may still rate service highly if providers were empathetic and communicative.

Second, because health consequences can be severe (disability, chronic illness, death), healthcare involves **high perceived risk** (Mitchell, 1999). This heightens patients' emotional sensitivity to service encounters, amplifying the impact of negative experiences (e.g., a dismissive comment from a nurse may be remembered more vividly than hours of competent care).

**4. Involuntary Consumption and Limited Choice**

Unlike discretionary services such as restaurants or hotels, healthcare consumption is often involuntary—patients seek care due to illness or injury rather than for enjoyment (Berry and Bendapudi, 2007). Furthermore, patient choice may be constrained by multiple factors: insurance networks limit provider options in market-based systems like the United States; geographic accessibility restricts rural patients' alternatives; urgency prevents "shopping around" in emergency situations; and specialist referrals direct patients to specific providers. This limited choice means that patient satisfaction does not perfectly align with service quality—dissatisfied patients may continue using a hospital due to lack of alternatives, while hospitals face reduced competitive pressure to improve quality when patients cannot easily switch providers.

### Determinants of Patient Satisfaction: Beyond Quality Dimensions

While service quality is a primary driver of patient satisfaction, research has identified additional determinants:

**1. Expectation Disconfirmation**

Following Oliver's (1980) expectation-disconfirmation theory, satisfaction is determined not by absolute quality but by the gap between expectations and perceptions. A rural clinic with modest facilities may yield high satisfaction if it exceeds patients' low expectations, while a prestigious academic hospital may disappoint patients with inflated expectations (Fisk et al., 1990).

**Cross-cultural implication**: Taiwanese and American patients may have different baseline expectations shaped by their respective healthcare systems (universal coverage vs. market-based), potentially leading to different satisfaction levels for objectively similar service quality.

**2. Outcome Valence**

Patients who experience positive health outcomes (symptom relief, successful surgery) rate service quality more favorably, even when controlling for actual service delivery (Ware et al., 1983). This **outcome bias** means that satisfaction partially reflects clinical results, not just service processes.

**3. Patient Characteristics**

Demographic and psychographic factors moderate quality perceptions in systematic ways. Age influences satisfaction levels, with older patients reporting higher satisfaction—potentially due to lower expectations or greater gratitude for care received (Hall and Dornan, 1988). Education level shapes evaluative standards, as highly educated patients tend to be more critical and expect more detailed communication from providers (Kane et al., 1997). Health status also moderates perceptions: sicker patients may evaluate service more leniently if they perceive providers are making genuine efforts to help, even when outcomes remain suboptimal (Ware et al., 1983).

**4. Prior Experience and Loyalty**

Repeat patients evaluate service more leniently than first-time patients, suggesting that **familiarity** and **trust accumulation** buffer against isolated negative experiences (Zeithaml et al., 1996).

### Why Exploratory Methods Are Necessary

The preceding review demonstrates that while theoretical frameworks (SERVQUAL, Brady & Cronin's hierarchical model, Dagger et al.'s four dimensions) provide valuable conceptual foundations, they suffer from **three limitations that necessitate exploratory, data-driven approaches**:

**Limitation 1: Predetermined Dimensions May Miss Context-Specific Concerns**

SERVQUAL's five dimensions were derived from focus groups in repair/maintenance, banking, long-distance telephone, securities brokerage, and credit card services—not healthcare (Parasuraman et al., 1988). While healthcare adaptations exist (e.g., Dagger et al., 2007), these were developed in specific contexts (Australia, U.S.) and may inadequately capture concerns unique to other settings. Taiwan's National Health Insurance system, for instance, may generate quality concerns regarding referral processes or freedom to choose specialists that differ from concerns in U.S. market-based insurance where network constraints are more restrictive. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced entirely new quality dimensions—infection control protocols, telemedicine quality—absent from pre-2020 frameworks. Cultural factors may similarly elevate different dimensions: physician authority may be more salient in high power-distance cultures like Taiwan, whereas shared decision-making may dominate in low power-distance cultures like the United States. Inductive topic modeling addresses this limitation by allowing quality dimensions to emerge from patient narratives rather than being researcher-imposed.

**Limitation 2: Survey Instruments Constrain Patient Expression**

Likert-scale surveys (e.g., "Rate the friendliness of staff on a 1-5 scale") force patients to evaluate predetermined attributes. Patients cannot introduce new concerns or describe experiences in their own words. If a patient's primary complaint is **parking availability**—an issue not included in the survey—it goes unrecorded.

**Solution**: Online reviews are **unsolicited, open-ended patient narratives** where patients freely choose what aspects to discuss, revealing their authentic priorities.

**Limitation 3: Cross-Cultural Invariance Assumptions**

Applying the same survey instrument (e.g., SERVQUAL) across cultures assumes dimensional equivalence—that the same dimensions exist and carry identical meaning in both contexts (Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998). However, cross-cultural measurement faces both semantic and dimensional non-equivalence challenges. Semantically, concepts like "empathy" may be culturally interpreted differently, with varying behavioral expectations for what constitutes empathetic care. Dimensionally, some quality attributes may exist in one culture but not another: "family accommodation" may be critical in collectivist cultures where family involvement in care is expected and normative, but largely absent as a quality criterion in individualist cultures emphasizing patient autonomy. Rather than imposing identical dimensional structures on Taiwan and U.S. data, we use LDA to independently discover quality dimensions in each country, then compare whether similar or different structures emerge—a more appropriate approach for exploratory cross-cultural research where dimensional equivalence cannot be assumed a priori.

### Summary: Theoretical Foundations for the Present Study

This section establishes the theoretical scaffolding for our research. Service quality is fundamentally multidimensional (Parasuraman et al., 1985, 1988), requiring measurement across multiple distinct attributes rather than reliance on global ratings. Healthcare service quality possesses unique characteristics—high-contact interactions, information asymmetry, outcome uncertainty—that differentiate it from generic service contexts (Berry & Bendapudi, 2007). Although technical quality determines medical outcomes, functional quality disproportionately influences patient perceptions due to its observability (Chang et al., 2013; Andaleeb, 2001). Critically, the number and nature of quality dimensions are context-dependent, varying across industries, cultures, and institutional settings (Ladhari, 2009), suggesting that predetermined frameworks like SERVQUAL may miss emergent, context-specific concerns (Buttle, 1996).

These principles lead to our research design: using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling on patient-generated online reviews to inductively discover service quality dimensions in Taiwan and the United States, comparing whether similar or divergent dimensional structures emerge across the two healthcare systems and cultural contexts. This exploratory approach allows quality dimensions to surface from patient narratives rather than being researcher-imposed, addressing the limitations of confirmatory survey methods while honoring the context-specificity and temporal evolution of quality constructs documented in the literature.

The next section reviews cross-cultural service quality research to develop expectations about how cultural and institutional differences between Taiwan and the U.S. may shape service quality dimensions.
