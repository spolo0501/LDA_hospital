# 2.3 Healthcare Systems: Taiwan vs. United States

While Section 2.2 established that cultural values shape service quality expectations, **institutional structures**—how healthcare is organized, financed, and regulated—also profoundly influence what patients experience, prioritize, and evaluate (Scott, 2008; Kuhlmann et al., 2020). Taiwan and the United States represent **polar opposite healthcare system models**: Taiwan operates a universal, single-payer National Health Insurance (NHI) system with comprehensive coverage and minimal out-of-pocket costs, while the U.S. employs a market-based, multi-payer model with variable coverage and high costs (Tikkanen et al., 2020). These institutional differences create distinct **structural constraints and incentives** that shape patient-provider interactions and service quality dimensions.

This section compares the two healthcare systems and develops expectations for how institutional differences may manifest in patient online reviews beyond cultural effects.

## 2.3.1 Taiwan's National Health Insurance System

### System Overview and Historical Context

Taiwan implemented its National Health Insurance (NHI) program in 1995, achieving universal healthcare coverage in less than a decade—one of the fastest transitions globally (Wu et al., 2018; Cheng, 2015). The NHI is a **mandatory, single-payer social insurance system** financed through payroll taxes, government subsidies, and modest premiums, administered by a government agency (the National Health Insurance Administration, NHIA).

**Key Characteristics**:

1. **Universal coverage**: 99.9% of Taiwan's 23.5 million residents are enrolled (Cheng, 2015)
2. **Comprehensive benefits**: Covers outpatient care, hospitalization, prescription drugs, dental care, traditional Chinese medicine, and preventive services
3. **Low cost-sharing**: Modest copayments (US$5-17 per outpatient visit; US$8-50 per day for hospitalization) with annual caps for vulnerable populations (Wu et al., 2018)
4. **Free choice of provider**: No gatekeeping; patients can directly access any clinic or hospital, including tertiary medical centers
5. **Global budget**: Fixed annual budget allocated across regions and provider categories, incentivizing cost control

### Access and Utilization

Taiwan's NHI achieves **exceptional accessibility**, as evidenced by utilization statistics:

- **Outpatient visits**: Average 14.2 visits per capita per year (2020)—among the highest globally (OECD average: 6.8 visits) (OECD Health Statistics, 2022)
- **Hospital density**: 21.7 hospitals per million population (U.S.: 19.5) (Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2021)
- **Geographic accessibility**: 93% of population lives within 5 km of a contracted medical facility (Cheng, 2015)
- **Wait times**: No waiting lists for elective procedures; same-day or next-day appointments common (Wu et al., 2018)

**Implications for service quality**:

✅ **High access eliminates access-related complaints**: Unlike systems with long wait times (U.K., Canada), Taiwanese patients rarely complain about inability to obtain care

⚠️ **High utilization creates crowding**: Extremely high visit rates (14.2/year) strain providers, potentially degrading interpersonal quality as physicians see 40-60 patients per clinic session (Cheng and Chiang, 2012)

⚠️ **No gatekeeping enables "doctor shopping"**: Patients can freely switch providers, reducing relational continuity but empowering dissatisfied patients to exit rather than voice complaints

### Cost and Financial Barriers

Taiwan's NHI is renowned for **affordability**:

- **Total health expenditure**: 6.6% of GDP (2020)—among the lowest in high-income countries (U.S.: 17.8%; OECD average: 9.9%) (World Bank, 2022)
- **Out-of-pocket spending**: 35.4% of total health expenditure (2020)—moderate by international standards (OECD average: 20%) (OECD Health Statistics, 2022)
- **Catastrophic spending**: Only 1.8% of households experience catastrophic health expenditures (>40% of capacity to pay) (Cheng, 2015)

**Copayment structure** (effective 2023):

| Service Type | Copayment (US$) |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Clinic visit | $5 |
| Regional hospital outpatient | $10 |
| Medical center outpatient (without referral) | $17 |
| Hospitalization (per day) | $8-50 (depending on room type) |
| Emergency (if not admitted) | $17 |

**Implications for service quality**:

✅ **Cost is not a salient quality dimension**: Nearly universal coverage and low copays mean patients rarely cite cost concerns in evaluations—unlike the U.S. where billing disputes dominate reviews (Ranard et al., 2016)

✅ **No insurance barriers**: Patients do not complain about "out-of-network" providers, prior authorization requirements, or coverage denials—issues pervasive in U.S. reviews

**However**, cost is not entirely absent:

⚠️ **Informal payments**: Some providers offer **self-paid "premium services"** (e.g., newer surgical techniques, private rooms) not covered by NHI, creating a two-tier system (Liu and Tsai, 2019)

⚠️ **Medication costs**: NHI covers most medications, but patients may pay out-of-pocket for non-formulary drugs or upgraded options

### Provider Behavior and Physician Workload

The NHI's payment system profoundly affects provider incentives and behavior:

**Fee-for-service (FFS) payment within global budget**:
- Providers are paid per service (consultation, test, procedure) but total spending is capped by regional budgets
- This creates a **volume-driven practice style**: physicians maximize patient throughput to maintain revenue under budget constraints (Cheng and Chiang, 2012)

**Consequences for service quality**:

⚠️ **Short consultation times**: Average consultation duration is 3-5 minutes in clinics, 5-8 minutes in hospitals (Tai-Seale et al., 2007)—significantly shorter than U.S. (15-20 minutes) or European standards (10-15 minutes)

⚠️ **High physician workload**: Hospital physicians see 40-60 outpatients per half-day session, plus inpatients, surgeries, and administrative duties (Liu and Tsai, 2019)

⚠️ **Physician burnout**: Surveys indicate high rates of burnout (47% of hospital physicians report emotional exhaustion) (Tsai et al., 2009)

**Implications**:
- Short consultation times may drive **communication quality complaints**: Patients feel rushed, unable to ask questions, or perceive physicians as inattentive
- Physician burnout may manifest as **poor interpersonal quality**: irritability, impatience, lack of empathy

### Patient Empowerment and Choice

Taiwan's NHI grants patients **extraordinary freedom**:

1. **No gatekeeping**: Patients can directly visit any specialist or medical center without referral
2. **No provider networks**: All contracted providers (95% of hospitals and clinics) accept NHI; no in-network vs. out-of-network distinction
3. **Medical records portability**: NHI IC card stores basic medical data, facilitating provider switching

**Behavioral consequences**:

✅ **High patient agency**: Dissatisfied patients easily switch providers, reducing lock-in

⚠️ **"Doctor shopping"**: 23% of patients visit 4+ clinics for the same condition within 30 days (Cheng, 2015), indicating either lack of trust or seeking second opinions

⚠️ **Overuse of medical centers**: Patients bypass local clinics to directly visit tertiary hospitals, believing they offer superior quality (despite higher copays as deterrents)—60% of outpatient visits are to hospitals vs. clinics, inverting the intended pyramid (Cheng, 2015)

**Implications for reviews**:
- Patients may have **higher expectations** for medical centers, comparing them to clinics
- Reviews may focus on **relative quality** across providers rather than absolute quality
- Patients who write reviews are likely **dissatisfied switchers** (exit) rather than loyal patients tolerating deficiencies (voice)

### Quality Monitoring and Accreditation

The NHIA monitors quality through:

1. **Hospital accreditation**: Mandatory accreditation by the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation (TJCHA), modeled on U.S. Joint Commission standards
2. **Pay-for-performance (P4P)**: Financial incentives for meeting quality metrics (e.g., diabetes control, asthma management)
3. **Public reporting**: Limited public disclosure of quality metrics; not widely accessed by patients

**Gap**: Unlike the U.S. (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems, HCAHPS), Taiwan lacks **standardized patient experience surveys** with public reporting, making online reviews a particularly valuable alternative data source.

### Summary: Taiwan NHI and Service Quality Dimensions

**Expected prominent dimensions** in Taiwanese reviews:

1. **Interpersonal quality (communication, empathy)**: Short consultation times and physician burnout likely generate complaints about rushed interactions and poor communication

2. **Wait times and crowding**: High utilization creates crowded waiting rooms and long waits despite no appointment backlogs

3. **Registration and administrative processes**: High visit frequency means patients repeatedly navigate registration, payment, and medication pickup—inefficiencies accumulate

4. **Service attitude of nursing staff**: High patient volumes strain nursing staff, potentially degrading interpersonal quality

**Expected absent dimensions**:

5. **Cost/billing**: Low copays and universal coverage minimize financial concerns

6. **Insurance coverage**: No coverage denials or network restrictions

## 2.3.2 U.S. Healthcare System

### System Overview and Structural Characteristics

The United States is unique among high-income countries in lacking universal health coverage. Its healthcare system is **pluralistic**, combining private insurance (employer-sponsored, individual market), public programs (Medicare for elderly, Medicaid for low-income, Veterans Affairs for veterans), and uninsured populations (Tikkanen et al., 2020). This complexity creates **fragmentation**, **variability in access and quality**, and **high costs** that profoundly shape patient experiences.

**Key Characteristics**:

1. **Multi-payer system**: Hundreds of private insurers with varying benefit designs, plus federal/state public programs
2. **Employment-based coverage dominant**: 54% of population insured through employers (2021); 35% through public programs; 9% uninsured (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022)
3. **High cost-sharing**: Deductibles (patient pays first $1,000-5,000), copayments, and coinsurance (percentage of costs) create substantial out-of-pocket burden
4. **Provider networks**: Most insurance plans restrict coverage to "in-network" providers, limiting patient choice
5. **Gatekeeping common**: Many plans require primary care referrals to see specialists
6. **Market-based competition**: Hospitals and insurers negotiate prices privately; wide price variation

### Access and Coverage Barriers

Despite high health expenditure (17.8% of GDP), the U.S. exhibits **significant access barriers**:

**Uninsurance and underinsurance**:
- **27.5 million uninsured** (9% of population) as of 2021 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2022)
- **Underinsured** (inadequate coverage): Additional 23% have high-deductible plans ($1,400+ individual deductible) with minimal first-dollar coverage (Commonwealth Fund, 2020)

**Wait times for appointments**:
- **Primary care**: Average 24-day wait for new patient appointments in major cities (Merritt Hawkins, 2017)
- **Specialists**: 30-50 day waits common for dermatology, orthopedics (Merritt Hawkins, 2017)
- **Geographic variation**: Rural areas face severe physician shortages; 80% of counties designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas (HRSA, 2021)

**Network restrictions**:
- **Narrow networks**: Insurers contract with limited provider sets to control costs; patients face high out-of-network costs or no coverage if seeing non-contracted providers
- **Network adequacy concerns**: 30% of insured adults report difficulty finding in-network specialists (Commonwealth Fund, 2020)

**Implications for service quality**:

⚠️ **Access-related dimensions prominent**: Appointment availability, wait times, and provider availability likely feature prominently in reviews—contrasting with Taiwan where access is rarely an issue

⚠️ **Insurance-related complaints**: Patients may discuss coverage denials, surprise bills, or provider network problems

⚠️ **Selection bias in reviews**: Uninsured and underinsured patients may underutilize care and thus be underrepresented in hospital reviews, skewing toward experiences of well-insured patients

### Cost and Financial Burden

The U.S. healthcare system is the **most expensive globally**, creating substantial financial stress for patients:

**Expenditure**:
- **Per capita health spending**: $12,914 (2021)—2-3× other high-income countries (OECD average: $5,428) (OECD Health Statistics, 2022)
- **Out-of-pocket spending**: 11% of total health expenditure (lower than Taiwan's 35.4% because most costs are paid by insurers, but absolute amounts are much higher) (OECD Health Statistics, 2022)

**Cost-sharing requirements** (typical employer-sponsored insurance, 2021):
- **Annual deductible**: $1,669 individual; $3,392 family (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2021)
- **Copayments**: $25-50 for primary care visit; $40-75 for specialist; $350-500 for emergency room
- **Coinsurance**: 20% of costs after deductible (for hospitalizations, this can mean thousands of dollars)
- **Out-of-pocket maximum**: $8,500 individual; $17,000 family (after which insurance covers 100%)

**Financial barriers and consequences**:
- **45% of adults report delaying or forgoing care due to cost** (Commonwealth Fund, 2020)
- **Catastrophic spending**: 21% of households experience catastrophic health expenditures (>10% of income) (Papanicolas et al., 2018)
- **Medical debt**: 23% of adults have medical debt in collections; medical expenses are the leading cause of personal bankruptcy (Himmelstein et al., 2019)

**Implications for service quality**:

⚠️ **Cost is a salient quality dimension**: Billing clarity, price transparency, financial counseling, and surprise bills likely dominate U.S. reviews—dimensions nearly absent in Taiwan

⚠️ **Value consciousness**: U.S. patients may explicitly evaluate **value for money** (cost-benefit), while Taiwanese patients evaluate quality independent of cost

⚠️ **Adversarial billing experiences**: Insurance claims denials, balance billing, and debt collection create **negative administrative experiences** distinct from clinical care

### Provider Behavior and Payment Incentives

The U.S. has transitioned from fee-for-service (FFS) toward **value-based payment** models, but FFS remains dominant:

**Traditional FFS** (still ~60% of physician payment):
- Pays per service (like Taiwan), but with much higher prices per service
- Historically incentivized **overtreatment** (more tests, procedures) rather than volume (more patients)

**Managed care and capitation** (HMOs):
- Some insurers pay fixed per-patient amounts (capitation), incentivizing **undertreatment** or care rationing

**Consequences for service quality**:

✅ **Longer consultation times**: Average 15-20 minutes per visit (vs. 3-5 minutes in Taiwan), allowing more thorough communication (Tai-Seale et al., 2007)

✅ **Lower patient volumes**: U.S. physicians see 15-25 patients per day vs. 40-60 in Taiwan, potentially improving interpersonal quality

⚠️ **Prior authorization burden**: Insurers require pre-approval for many tests, medications, and procedures, creating **administrative delays** and **care fragmentation**—common complaint sources

⚠️ **Financial discussions**: Physicians and staff must discuss costs, coverage, and payment plans—conversations rare in Taiwan but frequent (and often uncomfortable) in the U.S.

### Patient Choice and Constraints

U.S. patient choice is **paradoxical**: theoretically vast (thousands of hospitals), practically constrained:

**Constraints**:
1. **Insurance networks**: Can only use in-network providers without financial penalty
2. **Geographic access**: Rural patients may have only one nearby hospital
3. **Referral requirements**: Many plans require primary care gatekeeping
4. **Emergency situations**: Patients have no choice in emergencies; may be taken to out-of-network hospitals (surprise billing)

**Information availability**:
- **Public quality reporting**: CMS publicly reports HCAHPS patient experience scores, readmission rates, mortality rates for all hospitals (Hospital Compare)
- **Online reviews**: Yelp, Google, Healthgrades host millions of reviews
- **Price transparency**: New regulations (2021) require hospitals to publish prices, but implementation incomplete

**Implications**:
- U.S. patients may discuss **comparison shopping** and **referral difficulties** in reviews
- Reviews may reference **publicly reported quality metrics** or compare hospitals

### Quality Monitoring and Patient Experience Measurement

The U.S. has **extensive quality measurement infrastructure**:

**HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems)**:
- Mandatory standardized survey of hospitalized patients (administered post-discharge)
- Assesses: Communication with nurses/doctors, responsiveness, pain management, medication explanation, cleanliness, quietness, discharge information
- Scores publicly reported and tied to Medicare payment (hospitals with low scores receive reduced reimbursement)

**Accreditation**:
- The Joint Commission accredits 82% of hospitals; accreditation required for Medicare participation
- Focuses on safety and clinical processes more than patient experience

**Implications**:
- Online reviews **complement** HCAHPS by capturing outpatient experiences (HCAHPS only covers inpatients) and providing narrative detail
- Dimensions in reviews may **mirror HCAHPS domains** due to cultural diffusion (patients may use HCAHPS-like language)

### Summary: U.S. Healthcare System and Service Quality Dimensions

**Expected prominent dimensions** in U.S. reviews:

1. **Cost and billing**: Financial concerns, surprise bills, price transparency

2. **Insurance and coverage**: Prior authorization delays, network adequacy, coverage denials

3. **Access and wait times**: Appointment availability, wait times for specialists

4. **Care coordination**: Referrals, information transfer between providers (fragmentation concerns)

5. **Clinical outcomes and evidence-based care**: U.S. culture of transparency and accountability may drive outcome-focused evaluations

**Expected lower prominence**:

6. **Crowding and long in-person waits**: Lower patient volumes mean less crowded waiting rooms compared to Taiwan

7. **Rushed consultations**: Longer visit times reduce this complaint

## 2.3.3 Institutional Context and Service Quality Dimensions

### Comparative Summary: Taiwan vs. U.S. Healthcare Systems

**Table 2.3: Healthcare System Comparison and Service Quality Implications**

| Dimension | Taiwan NHI | United States | Expected Review Difference |
|-----------|------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Coverage** | Universal (99.9%) | Fragmented (91% insured) | U.S. reviews: insurance complaints; TW: absent |
| **Cost to patient** | Very low ($5-17/visit) | High ($25-50 copay + deductible) | U.S. reviews: cost/billing prominent; TW: minimal |
| **Access** | Excellent (14.2 visits/year) | Variable (wait times, shortages) | U.S. reviews: access barriers; TW: crowding |
| **Patient choice** | Total freedom (no gatekeeping) | Network restrictions | U.S. reviews: referral difficulties; TW: provider switching |
| **Consultation time** | Very short (3-5 min) | Longer (15-20 min) | TW reviews: rushed consultations; U.S.: less so |
| **Provider volume** | Very high (40-60 patients/session) | Moderate (15-25/day) | TW reviews: staff burnout symptoms; U.S.: less frequent |
| **Utilization** | Extremely high (14.2 visits/year) | Lower (4.0 visits/year) | TW reviews: more interactions = more complaints |
| **Payment model** | FFS + global budget | FFS transitioning to value-based | TW: volume pressure; U.S.: prior auth delays |
| **Quality reporting** | Limited public reporting | Extensive (HCAHPS, public data) | U.S. reviews: reference metrics; TW: subjective only |
| **Administrative burden** | Minimal (single payer) | High (multi-payer, prior auth) | U.S. reviews: administrative hassles; TW: less common |

*Sources: Cheng (2015); Wu et al. (2018); Tikkanen et al. (2020); OECD Health Statistics (2022)*

### Interaction Between Culture and Institutions

Importantly, **cultural and institutional effects are not independent**; they interact to produce system-specific service quality configurations.

**Example 1: Communication and Consultation Time**

- **Cultural effect alone (Section 2.2)**: Collectivist cultures (Taiwan) value interpersonal warmth and empathy more than individualist cultures (U.S.)
- **Institutional effect alone**: Taiwan's payment system creates 3-5 minute consultations vs. U.S. 15-20 minutes
- **Interaction**: Taiwanese patients **value empathy** (cultural) but **cannot receive it** due to time constraints (institutional), creating a **perceived quality gap**—potentially the primary pain point in Taiwanese reviews

**Prediction**: Communication quality complaints may be **more severe** in Taiwan than the U.S., not because cultural expectations are higher, but because **the gap between expectations and delivery is larger** (Oliver's expectation-disconfirmation theory, 1980).

**Example 2: Family Involvement**

- **Cultural effect**: Collectivist Taiwan expects family involvement (Section 2.2)
- **Institutional effect**: Taiwan's open visiting policies and family-friendly hospital designs accommodate this culturally (Wu et al., 2018)
- **Interaction**: Taiwanese hospitals may **satisfy family expectations** better than U.S. hospitals (where individualist culture and privacy regulations restrict family access), reducing complaints

**Prediction**: Family accommodation may be **less frequently complained about** in Taiwan than cultural differences alone would suggest, because institutions are adapted to cultural norms.

**Example 3: Cost Consciousness**

- **Cultural effect**: Individualist cultures (U.S.) may emphasize instrumental value (cost-benefit)
- **Institutional effect**: U.S. high costs and variable coverage make cost salient; Taiwan's low costs make it irrelevant
- **Interaction**: U.S. reviews discuss cost extensively not (primarily) due to cultural values but because **institutional reality forces cost consideration**

**Prediction**: Cost will dominate U.S. reviews and be nearly absent in Taiwan reviews—an **institutional effect stronger than cultural effects**.

### Hypothesized Institutional Effects on Service Quality Dimensions

Integrating institutional analysis with cultural expectations (Section 2.2), we propose:

**Institutional Hypothesis 1: Cost and Billing Dimension**

**IH1**: A distinct **cost/billing/insurance dimension** will emerge prominently in U.S. reviews but be **absent or minimal** in Taiwanese reviews.

**Rationale**: U.S. high costs and insurance complexity make financial aspects a salient quality dimension; Taiwan's low, uniform costs remove this concern (Papanicolas et al., 2018 vs. Cheng, 2015).

---

**Institutional Hypothesis 2: Access Barriers vs. Crowding**

**IH2a**: U.S. reviews will discuss **appointment access**, **wait times for appointments**, and **provider availability** more than Taiwan.

**IH2b**: Taiwan reviews will discuss **crowding**, **waiting room waits**, and **rushed service** more than the U.S.

**Rationale**: U.S. access barriers (Merritt Hawkins, 2017) vs. Taiwan's high utilization and crowding (Cheng, 2015) create inverse problems.

---

**Institutional Hypothesis 3: Communication Quality Prominence**

**IH3**: Taiwanese reviews will emphasize **communication quality** and **rushed consultations** more than U.S. reviews.

**Rationale**: Taiwan's 3-5 minute consultations (Tai-Seale et al., 2007) create expectation-perception gaps despite cultural valuation of communication (interaction of cultural and institutional effects).

---

**Institutional Hypothesis 4: Administrative Processes**

**IH4**: U.S. reviews will discuss **prior authorization**, **referral difficulties**, and **insurance claim problems**, while Taiwan reviews will discuss **registration efficiency** and **medication pickup**.

**Rationale**: Different administrative pain points: U.S. multi-payer complexity (prior auth) vs. Taiwan high-frequency visits (registration repetition).

---

**Institutional Hypothesis 5: Care Coordination**

**IH5**: U.S. reviews will discuss **care coordination failures** (information not transferred between providers) more than Taiwan.

**Rationale**: U.S. fragmentation across insurers and health systems (Tikkanen et al., 2020) vs. Taiwan's integrated NHI IC card system (Cheng, 2015).

---

### Synthesis: A Three-Level Model of Service Quality Dimensions

Our literature review suggests service quality dimensions emerge from **three levels of influence**:

**Level 1: Universal Healthcare Characteristics**

Dimensions common across all healthcare systems due to inherent features of medical care:
- Clinical consultation process (diagnosis, treatment)
- Physical environment (cleanliness, facilities)
- Basic interpersonal interactions (courtesy, respect)

**Expectation**: These dimensions appear in **both Taiwan and U.S. reviews**.

---

**Level 2: Cultural Influences**

Dimensions shaped by national culture (Hofstede, 2001; Furrer et al., 2000):
- Emphasis on empathy/warmth (collectivism)
- Family involvement (collectivism)
- Physician authority vs. shared decision-making (power distance)
- Communication directness (high- vs. low-context)

**Expectation**: **Relative importance** of universal dimensions differs (e.g., empathy more salient in Taiwan), and culture-specific dimensions emerge (e.g., family accommodation in Taiwan).

---

**Level 3: Institutional Influences**

Dimensions shaped by healthcare system structure (Kuhlmann et al., 2020; Scott, 2008):
- Cost/billing (U.S. high costs vs. Taiwan low costs)
- Access modality (U.S. appointment barriers vs. Taiwan crowding)
- Administrative processes (U.S. insurance complexity vs. Taiwan registration repetition)
- Consultation duration (shaped by payment incentives)

**Expectation**: System-specific dimensions emerge (e.g., insurance in U.S., crowding in Taiwan), and some cultural expectations are **amplified or suppressed** by institutional constraints (e.g., Taiwan's cultural valuation of communication amplified by institutional time pressure into a critical pain point).

---

### Research Questions Refined

Integrating cultural (Section 2.2) and institutional (Section 2.3) perspectives, our research questions are refined:

**RQ1 (Descriptive)**: What service quality dimensions emerge from Taiwan and U.S. hospital reviews using LDA topic modeling?

**RQ2 (Comparative)**: How do the dimensional structures differ between Taiwan and the U.S.?
- Which dimensions are **universal** (appear in both)?
- Which are **country-specific** (unique to one context)?
- Which dimensions show **differential prominence** (present in both but varying in importance)?

**RQ3 (Explanatory)**: Can observed differences be explained by:
- **Cultural factors** (Hofstede's dimensions, collectivism/individualism)?
- **Institutional factors** (healthcare system structure, financing, access)?
- **Interaction effects** (culture × institutions)?

**RQ4 (Methodological)**: Does the inductive, data-driven LDA approach reveal dimensions **not captured** by Western-developed survey instruments (SERVQUAL, HCAHPS), particularly in the Taiwan context?

---

## Summary: Institutional Foundations for Cross-Cultural Comparison

This section establishes that:

1. **Taiwan's NHI and U.S. healthcare systems are polar opposites**: Universal single-payer vs. market-based multi-payer; high access/low cost vs. variable access/high cost; short consultations/high volume vs. longer consultations/moderate volume (Cheng, 2015; Tikkanen et al., 2020).

2. **Institutional structures shape patient experiences independently of culture**: U.S. patients face cost burdens and insurance complexity regardless of cultural values; Taiwanese patients experience crowding and rushed care regardless of collectivist orientation.

3. **Culture and institutions interact**: Taiwan's cultural valuation of empathy (collectivism) combined with institutional time constraints (3-5 minute visits) creates a **magnified quality gap**; U.S. institutional cost burdens may overwhelm cultural preferences for other quality dimensions.

4. **Five institutional hypotheses** (IH1-IH5) predict system-specific dimensions: Cost/billing in U.S. (IH1), access barriers vs. crowding (IH2), communication prominence in Taiwan (IH3), administrative process differences (IH4), care coordination in U.S. (IH5).

5. **A three-level model** (universal, cultural, institutional) provides a framework for interpreting LDA results and explaining cross-national differences.

With cultural (Section 2.2) and institutional (Section 2.3) foundations established, Section 2.4 reviews online reviews as a data source, and Section 2.5 examines text mining methodologies (particularly LDA) for discovering service quality dimensions from patient narratives.
