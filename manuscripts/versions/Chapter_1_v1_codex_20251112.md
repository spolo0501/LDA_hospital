Healthcare service quality remains one of the most pressing challenges facing health systems worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, inadequate quality of care contributes to millions of preventable cases of harm to patients annually, with significant variation across countries and healthcare systems (WHO, 2020). While substantial research has examined healthcare quality within individual nations, a critical question remains largely unanswered: Do patients in different healthcare systems—particularly those with fundamentally different organizational structures—prioritize the same service‑quality dimensions? Understanding these cross‑national patterns is essential for identifying universal challenges in healthcare that transcend system boundaries. It is also important to recognize that system structure and cultural context can generate quality dimensions that emerge in one context yet remain absent in another. This distinction between universal and system‑specific dimensions is critical: universal challenges enable the transfer of international best practices, whereas system‑specific dimensions require interventions tailored to particular institutional and cultural contexts.

The contrast between Taiwan’s single‑payer National Health Insurance (NHI) system and the United States (U.S.) multi‑payer, market‑based system offers a natural comparative setting for examining how system structure shapes perceived service quality. Although both countries achieve strong health outcomes, patients navigate very different delivery and financing arrangements: Taiwan’s NHI provides universal coverage under standardized fee schedules that largely remove financial barriers, whereas the U.S. blends private insurance, employer‑sponsored plans, and public programs (Medicare, Medicaid), producing wide variation in coverage, out‑of‑pocket costs, and access. These structural differences create distinct constraints and enablers that influence which aspects of quality patients attend to. In multi‑payer systems, financial complexity and insurance navigation can become central concerns—a “system tax” on satisfaction—while in single‑payer systems these barriers recede and capacity and crowding pressures often come to the fore. The key theoretical issue, therefore, is not only whether certain dimensions matter more, but how system design shapes the very composition of quality dimensions that patients perceive—a question that remains underexplored yet carries substantial policy implications.

Prior research confirms that differences between the Taiwan and U.S. healthcare systems generate distinct patient‑experience patterns. Yoon and Cheng’s (2021) large‑scale comparison of 1,374 hospitals found that perceived inpatient care quality was significantly higher in the U.S. The association between regional socioeconomic status and patient satisfaction exhibited opposite patterns (negative in Taiwan, positive in the U.S.). These findings suggest that systemic and cultural differences fundamentally shape patient experiences. However, that study examined only three predetermined satisfaction dimensions using structured surveys, leaving unexplored which additional service‑quality dimensions emerge when patients express concerns in their own words and whether the dimensional structure itself differs across systems.

Traditional assessments rely predominantly on structured instruments such as SERVQUAL (Parasuraman et al., 1988) and healthcare‑adapted variants (Dagger et al., 2007). While these instruments provide standardized measurement, they pose limitations that are particularly problematic in cross‑cultural research. First, researcher‑imposed frameworks constrain patient expression to predetermined dimensions that may not capture culture‑specific priorities or emerging concerns (Carman, 1990). Second, cross‑cultural translation introduces measurement non‑equivalence across cultures, with items carrying different connotations across languages and response styles varying systematically by culture (Harzing, 2006). Third, social desirability bias may suppress honest criticism, particularly in cultures emphasizing social harmony and respect for authority. Finally, the time lag between survey design and data collection can render findings outdated by publication, which is especially problematic in rapidly evolving healthcare systems.

The proliferation of online patient reviews on platforms such as Google Maps offers methodological opportunities to address these limitations. These unsolicited narratives offer five advantages—authenticity, immediacy, scale, cross‑cultural comparability, and richness—often capturing contextual detail and emotional intensity absent from structured surveys (Ranard et al., 2016). However, extracting service‑quality dimensions from massive unstructured, multilingual text requires methods that avoid imposing predetermined frameworks while enabling rigorous cross‑national comparison.

Three critical gaps constrain theoretical and practical progress. First, most research remains single‑country in focus, and the limited cross‑national studies often use different methods that hinder direct comparison (Fung et al., 2008). To our knowledge, no study has applied identical analytical methods to patient‑generated data across drastically different healthcare systems to identify universal versus country‑specific dimensions. Without such comparison, we cannot determine what share of patient discourse addresses universal versus system‑specific concerns.

Second, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)—an unsupervised method that extracts latent themes from large text corpora without researcher‑imposed categories (Blei et al., 2003)—remains underused in healthcare and is rare in cross‑lingual applications. Although LDA is increasingly applied to hospitality and retail reviews, no study has developed a systematic framework for applying LDA across Chinese and English hospital reviews to enable semantic mapping and cross‑cultural comparison.

Third, service‑quality theory contains an unresolved tension: Are quality dimensions universal across cultures and contexts, or are they fundamentally shaped by cultural values and system structures (Brady and Cronin, 2001)? Existing research has not quantified the balance between universality and contingency; we lack evidence on what proportion of patient‑perceived dimensions transcend national boundaries versus reflect country‑specific institutional and cultural factors. Moreover, it remains unclear whether country‑specific dimensions reflect system structure or cultural values, as most studies confound these sources by comparing only pairs of countries.

This study addresses these gaps through a comparative analysis of patient reviews from Taiwan and the U.S. We pose three research questions: (1) Which service‑quality dimensions emerge from hospital reviews in Taiwan versus the U.S. when analyzed using identical unsupervised topic‑modeling methods? (2) Which dimensions represent universal concerns that transcend national boundaries, and which are country‑specific? (3) What are the sources of cross‑national differences in dimensions, and through what mechanisms do system structures and cultural contexts shape these differences?

To answer these questions, we collected 5,007 patient reviews from 26 top‑ranked medical centers in Taiwan and 3,240 reviews from 28 top‑ranked hospitals in the U.S., all from Google Maps. We applied LDA topic modeling independently to each language corpus and then conducted cross‑lingual semantic mapping to identify universal versus country‑specific dimensions. This approach allows us to quantify the share of patient discourse devoted to universal versus system‑specific concerns, assess whether country‑specific dimensions reflect institutional structure or cultural values, and identify which dimensions transcend system boundaries versus those that emerge only in one context.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews service‑quality theory, cross‑cultural healthcare research, comparisons of healthcare systems, online reviews as data sources, and topic‑modeling applications. Section 3 details data collection, preprocessing for the Chinese and English corpora, the LDA modeling approach, cross‑lingual semantic mapping, and statistical‑testing methods. Section 4 presents the extracted dimensions for each country, cross‑national comparisons revealing universal and country‑specific patterns, and statistical tests that quantify differences. Section 5 concludes with answers to the research questions, theoretical and practical contributions, methodological innovations, limitations, and directions for future research.
