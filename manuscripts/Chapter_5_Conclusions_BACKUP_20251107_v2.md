# Chapter 5: Conclusions

This study provides the first systematic cross-national comparison of healthcare service quality dimensions using identical unsupervised topic modeling methods applied to patient-generated online reviews from Taiwan and the United States. By analyzing 5,007 Chinese-language reviews from Taiwan's 26 medical centers and 3,240 English-language reviews from 28 leading U.S. hospitals through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling, cross-lingual semantic mapping, and statistical hypothesis testing, we addressed three fundamental research questions posed in Chapter 1. This concluding chapter presents answers to these research questions, synthesizes theoretical and practical contributions, acknowledges study limitations, and charts directions for future research.

## Answers to Research Questions

**Research Question 1: What service quality dimensions emerge from patient reviews of hospitals in Taiwan versus the United States when analyzed using identical unsupervised topic modeling methods?**

Our LDA analysis revealed seven distinct dimensions in Taiwan and six in the United States. Taiwan's seven dimensions include: (1) Medical Professional Quality (27.2% of reviews, 4.67 stars), (2) Registration and Billing Process (6.9%, 1.83 stars), (3) Service Attitude Issues (17.3%, 1.69 stars), (4) Facility and Environment Quality (8.1%, 2.73 stars), (5) Surgical and Specialty Care (5.3%, 4.02 stars), (6) Inpatient Care Experience (4.3%, 2.35 stars), and (7) Emergency Medical Services (30.9%, 1.79 stars). The United States' six dimensions include: (1) Critical Care and Family Support (16.4%, 3.29 stars), (2) Emergency and Waiting Time (34.8%, 3.25 stars), (3) Outpatient Care Services (14.7%, 3.08 stars), (4) Nursing Care Quality (20.5%, 3.00 stars), (5) Overall Positive Experience (9.5%, 3.96 stars), and (6) Billing and Insurance Issues (4.1%, 2.92 stars).

Notably, emergency care dominates patient discourse in both countries—constituting 30.9% of Taiwan reviews and 34.8% of U.S. reviews—yet satisfaction levels diverge dramatically. Taiwanese patients rate emergency care at 1.79 stars (the lowest rating in our entire dataset), while American patients rate it at 3.25 stars, yielding a 1.46-star gap that is highly statistically significant (t(2672) = 19.97, p < .001, d = 0.782). This divergence suggests that while emergency department crowding represents a universal concern, system structure profoundly influences satisfaction: Taiwan's single-payer system removing financial barriers may increase utilization including non-urgent cases, exacerbating overcrowding, whereas the U.S. multi-payer system's financial barriers may function as implicit demand management, maintaining lower patient volume relative to capacity.

**Research Question 2: Which service quality dimensions represent universal concerns that transcend national boundaries, and which are country-specific?**

Through systematic cross-lingual semantic mapping, we identified four universal dimensions appearing in both countries with high or medium semantic similarity: (1) Emergency Care (High similarity—both countries' dimensions centrally address emergency department services and waiting times), (2) Professional/Nursing Care (Medium similarity—both address healthcare worker competence but with different personnel focus and evaluative emphasis), (3) Outpatient Services (Medium similarity—both involve outpatient care but with different focal concerns), and (4) Inpatient/Critical Care (Medium similarity—both involve hospitalization but emphasize different aspects). These four universal dimensions collectively account for approximately 78% of patient reviews in both countries, demonstrating that certain core healthcare concerns transcend national boundaries.

However, four country-specific dimensions emerged in only one country, accounting for approximately 22% of reviews. Taiwan exhibits two unique dimensions: "Service Attitude Issues" (17.3%, 1.69 stars) and "Facility and Environment Quality" (8.1%, 2.73 stars). The United States exhibits two unique dimensions: "Billing and Insurance Issues" (4.1%, 2.92 stars) and "Overall Positive Experience" (9.5%, 3.96 stars). These presence-versus-absence patterns demonstrate that national contexts—whether through healthcare system structure or cultural values—fundamentally shape which service aspects achieve dimension-level salience in patient evaluations.

**Research Question 3: What are the sources of cross-national differences in service quality dimensions, and through what mechanisms do healthcare system structures and cultural contexts shape these differences?**

Cross-national differences in service quality dimensions arise from two distinct sources. **Institutional sources** reflect healthcare system structure: the U.S. "Billing and Insurance Issues" dimension (4.1%) stems entirely from multi-payer complexity and is absent in Taiwan's single-payer system, representing what we term "system tax"—satisfaction penalties imposed by multi-payer complexity independent of clinical quality. Administrative complaints also differ by system design—Taiwan focuses on process inefficiency (registration queuing, 6.9%), whereas the U.S. focuses on financial complexity (billing disputes, 4.1%). **Cultural sources** reflect societal values and priorities: Taiwan's distinct "Service Attitude Issues" dimension (17.3%, 1.69 stars) likely reflects collectivist East Asian cultures' heightened sensitivity to interpersonal treatment and harmony in social relationships, while the U.S.'s significantly greater emphasis on emergency care (34.8% vs. 30.9%, χ²(1) = 13.74, p < .001) may reflect American cultural values emphasizing time efficiency and productivity. This dual-source framework—distinguishing institutional from cultural origins—clarifies that some quality dimensions emerge from healthcare system design (and could change through policy reform), while others arise from deeper cultural values (requiring culturally-tailored quality assessment and improvement strategies).

These sources shape patient quality perceptions through three mechanisms. First, **dimensional composition through presence-versus-absence patterns**: healthcare system structure and cultural context determine which service aspects coalesce into distinct dimensions. The U.S. billing dimension and Taiwan's service attitude dimension exemplify this mechanism—each appears prominently in one country yet is entirely absent from the other, demonstrating that institutional and cultural forces determine which concerns achieve dimension-level salience. Second, **satisfaction levels within universal dimensions**: even when the same dimension appears in both countries, system structure influences satisfaction ratings. For emergency care—the only dimension achieving High semantic similarity permitting valid rating comparison—satisfaction diverges dramatically (Taiwan 1.79 stars vs. U.S. 3.25 stars, p < .001, d = 0.782). This 1.46-star gap suggests Taiwan's universal access generates higher demand including non-urgent cases, creating severe overcrowding, while the U.S. system's financial barriers maintain lower relative utilization despite continued wait time complaints. Third, **differential emphasis on shared concerns**: both countries address emergency care and administrative processes, but the nature and intensity of complaints reflect system-specific pain points. Single-payer systems standardize pricing but face high-volume queuing, while multi-payer systems maintain lower facility utilization but impose financial navigation burdens.

## Contributions to Theory and Practice

This research makes contributions across theoretical, practical, and methodological domains. Theoretically, we reconcile the longstanding debate between universal and culturally-contingent perspectives in service quality research. Rather than adopting an either-or stance, our findings support a hybrid model: core quality concerns (emergency care, professional competence, administrative processes) operate universally, appearing spontaneously in patient discourse regardless of system structure or cultural context, yet the specific dimensional configuration requires substantial institutional and cultural contextualization. We introduce the concept of "system tax" to describe how multi-payer healthcare systems impose satisfaction penalties independent of clinical quality—billing and insurance issues constitute 4.1% of U.S. discourse yet are entirely absent from Taiwan's single-payer structure, representing an entire dimension of dissatisfaction that universal coverage systems eliminate by design. Our findings demonstrate that institutional effects dominate dimensional composition (determining which quality aspects coalesce into distinct dimensions), while cultural effects primarily shape evaluation standards within dimensions (how patients rate dimensions once salient).

Practically, our findings provide actionable guidance for hospital administrators and health policymakers. For Taiwan, emergency care transformation should be the highest priority given its dominance (30.9% of reviews) and exceptionally low satisfaction (1.79 stars). Recommended interventions include implementing advanced triage systems, expanding emergency department capacity through dedicated staffing, improving patient communication about wait times, developing fast-track systems for minor ailments, and strengthening emergency-inpatient integration. Service attitude training represents the second priority (17.3%, 1.69 stars), requiring both symptom-focused interventions (interpersonal communication training) and cause-focused interventions (reducing healthcare worker burnout through improved staffing ratios and workload management). For the United States, hospitals should address billing transparency and simplification to mitigate the "system tax" burden, including providing upfront cost estimates, assigning patient financial counselors, simplifying billing statements, and establishing clear appeals processes. U.S. emergency care, while rated higher than Taiwan (3.25 stars), still represents the largest dimension (34.8%) and warrants continued attention through capacity expansion and process improvement.

Policymakers face system-level challenges requiring coordinated action beyond individual hospital initiatives. Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare should develop national emergency care standards including mandatory staffing ratios based on patient volume, financial incentives for hospitals achieving satisfaction targets, and enhanced primary care access to reduce emergency department misuse. U.S. policymakers should accelerate price transparency regulations, standardize insurance explanation documents, prohibit surprise billing, and streamline prior authorization processes. Both countries should recognize emergency care as a universal challenge suitable for international cooperation, including cross-national best practice exchanges and jointly funded research on emergency department management innovations.

Methodologically, we advance cross-cultural text analysis through three innovations. First, our integrated topic number selection framework balances statistical coherence and perplexity with semantic interpretability by domain experts and theoretical alignment with established service quality frameworks, providing a replicable template for applied LDA research where statistical optima frequently diverge from practical utility. Second, our systematic cross-lingual semantic mapping protocol enables comparison while respecting linguistic differences through independent LDA extraction in each language, explicit similarity classification (High/Medium/Low based on >70%, 50-70%, <50% thematic overlap), and tiered comparison strategies matched to similarity levels—presence-versus-absence comparisons for all dimensions, proportion differences for universal dimensions, and rating comparisons only for High-similarity dimensions. This protocol addresses the fundamental methodological challenge that statistical significance does not justify cross-national rating comparisons when dimensions measure substantively different constructs. Third, our multi-method topic validation framework triangulates evidence from representative text analysis (95% alignment rate), keyword overlap analysis (mean overlap 16%, below 20% discrimination threshold), internal consistency assessment (mean topic probabilities 0.60-0.71), and theoretical alignment (complete mapping to SERVQUAL and healthcare quality frameworks), providing substantially stronger validation than the common practice of relying solely on keyword inspection.

## Limitations and Future Research

This study's limitations suggest directions for future research. First, Google Maps reviewers represent a self-selected sample potentially biased toward younger, technologically proficient, and strongly satisfied or dissatisfied patients (extremity bias), with the bi-modal rating distribution (high concentration at 1-star and 5-star) suggesting polarized feedback. Our focus on top-tier hospitals (Taiwan's 26 medical centers, U.S. News top-28 hospitals) limits generalizability to community hospitals or rural facilities. Future research should employ multi-method data collection combining online reviews with structured surveys and patient interviews, and expand sampling to include community hospitals to test whether findings generalize beyond elite institutions.

Second, our cross-sectional design (July 2024 data collection, reviews spanning 2018-2024) captures a snapshot of patient sentiment but cannot identify temporal trends or establish causality. Healthcare systems evolve—Taiwan's NHI implemented reforms, U.S. price transparency regulations changed—yet we cannot assess how these policy changes influenced dimensions or satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted healthcare delivery, potentially altering patient priorities in ways our data cannot disentangle from pre-pandemic patterns. Longitudinal research tracking how dimensions evolve would reveal whether dimensions are stable or dynamic, how policy reforms influence priorities, and whether pandemic effects persist.

Third, LDA's inherent limitations constrain interpretation. Topic number selection (K) required subjective judgment despite our systematic framework—different researchers might reasonably select alternative K values yielding different interpretations. Topic labels, although validated through multiple methods, required interpretive judgment—alternative labels emphasizing different nuances might be equally defensible. LDA's bag-of-words assumption discards word order and contextual meaning, limiting semantic sophistication. Future research could employ complementary methods—structural topic models incorporating covariates, neural topic models leveraging word embeddings, or transformer-based models enabling context-aware analysis—though these sacrifice LDA's advantage of unsupervised discovery without predetermined categories.

Fourth, of our 11 hypotheses (6 cultural, 5 institutional), we tested only 4 with strong methodological justification. Seven hypotheses required analytical methods beyond topic modeling: keyword frequency analysis for shared decision-making and outcome versus credential focus, qualitative discourse analysis for communication directness, or temporal analysis for consultation time complaints. Our conservative statistical testing strategy—limiting rating comparisons to High-similarity dimensions only—meant we could not test certain hypotheses even when dimensions existed in both countries. Future research applying complementary methods—n-gram analysis, sentiment analysis, qualitative coding—could test hypotheses our approach could not definitively address.

Fifth, our bilingual analysis (Chinese, English) enabled cross-cultural comparison but simplified cultural complexity. Taiwan represents one East Asian cultural context, but East Asian cultures vary substantially—Japan, South Korea, and mainland China exhibit different cultural values and healthcare systems despite geographic proximity. The United States contains substantial internal diversity across regions, racial/ethnic groups, and immigrant populations. Our analysis treats each country as culturally homogeneous, potentially obscuring important within-country variation. Future cross-cultural research should expand to multiple countries within cultural clusters (East Asia: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China; West: USA, UK, Canada, Australia) to distinguish cultural patterns from country-specific idiosyncrasies.

Despite these limitations, our findings demonstrate the value of combining unsupervised machine learning with cross-cultural research methods to discover how institutional structures and cultural values jointly shape patient quality perceptions. Future research directions include: expanding cross-national comparison to additional countries to test whether Taiwan-USA patterns generalize, particularly comparing multiple single-payer systems (Taiwan, UK, Canada) and multiple multi-payer systems (USA, Switzerland, Netherlands) to isolate system effects from country-specific factors; linking patient review data to clinical outcomes, hospital characteristics, and regional socioeconomic indicators for multi-level analysis explaining why some hospitals achieve high satisfaction within the same system structure; and conducting experimental studies manipulating specific dimensions (reducing emergency wait times, enhancing service attitude training) to test causal mechanisms our cross-sectional data can only suggest.

## Concluding Remarks

This research demonstrates that patient-perceived healthcare service quality exhibits both universality and contingency. While emergency care, professional competence, and administrative processes represent universal concerns appearing across dramatically different healthcare systems, the specific dimensional structure through which patients organize their quality evaluations reflects system structure and cultural context. Multi-payer healthcare systems impose a "system tax"—billing and insurance dimensions—that single-payer systems eliminate, whereas single-payer systems accepting all patients may face infrastructure strain (facility crowding) and interpersonal challenges (service attitude problems from healthcare worker burnout) less prominent in systems with financial access barriers limiting utilization.

The policy implications are clear: emergency care requires both universal solutions (improved triage, expanded capacity, better communication) applicable across systems and system-specific solutions (Taiwan: demand management through enhanced primary care; USA: financial barrier reduction to prevent delayed care leading to emergency presentations). International cooperation on emergency care best practices could benefit all health systems given the shared nature of this challenge. However, system-specific dimensions require tailored interventions—billing transparency and simplification for multi-payer systems, service attitude training and healthcare worker protection for single-payer high-volume systems.

As healthcare systems worldwide grapple with quality improvement amid financial constraints and aging populations, understanding which quality challenges are universal and which are system-specific becomes essential for effective resource allocation and international learning. Our findings suggest that while all health systems can learn from each other's approaches to universal challenges like emergency care management and professional excellence, system-specific challenges require solutions tailored to institutional and cultural contexts. The future of healthcare quality research lies in hybrid approaches that recognize both commonality and contingency across the world's diverse healthcare systems, employing data-driven methods that allow patient priorities to emerge authentically rather than imposing predetermined Western frameworks on non-Western populations. By combining the rigor of unsupervised machine learning with the depth of cross-cultural research methods, we can build truly global understanding of healthcare quality that respects both universal human needs and culturally-specific values.
