# Chapter 5: Conclusions

This study provides the first systematic cross-national comparison of healthcare service quality dimensions using identical unsupervised topic modeling methods applied to patient-generated online reviews from Taiwan and the United States. By analyzing 5,007 Chinese-language reviews from Taiwan's 26 medical centers and 3,240 English-language reviews from 28 leading U.S. hospitals through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling, cross-lingual semantic mapping, and statistical testing, we addressed three fundamental research questions posed in Chapter 1. This concluding chapter presents answers to these research questions, synthesizes theoretical and practical contributions, acknowledges study limitations, and charts directions for future research.

## Answers to Research Questions

**Research Question 1: What service quality dimensions emerge from patient reviews of hospitals in Taiwan versus the United States when analyzed using identical unsupervised topic modeling methods?**

Our LDA analysis revealed seven distinct dimensions in Taiwan and six in the United States, with emergency care emerging as the dominant concern in both countries (30.9% of Taiwan reviews, 34.8% of U.S. reviews). Taiwan's dimensional structure centers on medical professional quality (27.2%), service attitude issues (17.3%), and facility environment quality (8.1%), alongside emergency services, registration processes, surgical care, and inpatient experiences. The United States' structure emphasizes nursing care quality (20.5%), critical care and family support (16.4%), and outpatient services (14.7%), alongside emergency care, overall positive experiences, and billing/insurance issues. Notably, while emergency care dominates discourse in both countries, satisfaction diverges dramatically—Taiwan's 1.79 stars represents the lowest rating in our dataset, compared to the U.S.'s 3.25 stars, a 1.46-star gap (t(2672) = 19.97, p < .001, d = 0.782).

These emergent dimensions both converge with and diverge from established service quality frameworks. Table 5.1 maps our dimensions to SERVQUAL's five generic constructs (Parasuraman et al., 1988) and Dagger et al.'s (2007) healthcare-specific model. This comparison reveals that while core SERVQUAL dimensions appear across both countries—tangibles (facility quality), reliability (professional competence), responsiveness (emergency care, wait times), assurance (professional quality, critical care), and empathy (nursing care, service attitude)—the specific dimensional configurations reflect healthcare context. Our findings extend Dagger et al.'s (2007) interpersonal quality, technical quality, environment quality, and administrative quality framework by demonstrating that these categories fragment into distinct patient-salient dimensions shaped by institutional and cultural forces.

**[Table 5.1: Mapping Emergent Dimensions to Established Service Quality Frameworks]**

| Framework | Dimension | Taiwan Dimensions (Coverage) | USA Dimensions (Coverage) |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **SERVQUAL** (Parasuraman et al., 1988) | | | |
| Tangibles | Physical facilities, equipment, appearance | Facility & Environment Quality (8.1%) | - |
| Reliability | Perform service dependably, accurately | Medical Professional Quality (27.2%)<br>Surgical & Specialty Care (5.3%) | Nursing Care Quality (20.5%)<br>Critical Care & Family Support (16.4%) |
| Responsiveness | Willingness to help, prompt service | Emergency Medical Services (30.9%)<br>Registration & Billing Process (6.9%) | Emergency & Waiting Time (34.8%)<br>Outpatient Care Services (14.7%) |
| Assurance | Knowledge, courtesy, trust | Medical Professional Quality (27.2%) | Critical Care & Family Support (16.4%) |
| Empathy | Caring, individualized attention | Service Attitude Issues (17.3%)<br>Inpatient Care Experience (4.3%) | Nursing Care Quality (20.5%)<br>Overall Positive Experience (9.5%) |
| **Dagger et al.** (2007) | | | |
| Interpersonal Quality | Staff warmth, communication, empathy | Service Attitude Issues (17.3%)<br>Inpatient Care (4.3%) | Nursing Care Quality (20.5%) |
| Technical Quality | Clinical competence, diagnosis, treatment | Medical Professional Quality (27.2%)<br>Surgical Care (5.3%) | Critical Care & Family Support (16.4%) |
| Environment Quality | Facilities, cleanliness, safety | Facility & Environment Quality (8.1%) | - |
| Administrative Quality | Registration, billing, scheduling | Registration & Billing Process (6.9%) | Billing & Insurance Issues (4.1%)<br>Outpatient Services (14.7%) |
| **System-Specific** | | | |
| Financial Access Barriers | Insurance, billing complexity, costs | - | **Billing & Insurance Issues (4.1%)** |
| General Satisfaction Expression | Overall praise/recommendation | - | **Overall Positive Experience (9.5%)** |

**Key observations from Table 5.1:**

First, **SERVQUAL's generic dimensions manifest universally but fragment context-specifically**. All five SERVQUAL constructs appear in both countries, confirming Parasuraman et al.'s (1988) claim that tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy represent fundamental service quality attributes. However, these generic categories do not map one-to-one onto patient-salient dimensions. Instead, SERVQUAL's "responsiveness" fragments into emergency care (both countries), registration processes (Taiwan), and outpatient services (USA), demonstrating that generic constructs require context-specific instantiation. This finding addresses Buttle's (1996) critique that SERVQUAL's factor structure varies across contexts—our results suggest SERVQUAL identifies valid conceptual categories but that empirical dimensional structures require inductive discovery within specific service settings.

Second, **Dagger et al.'s (2007) healthcare-specific framework provides better alignment but still misses system-specific concerns**. Interpersonal quality, technical quality, environment quality, and administrative quality all emerge distinctly in our data, validating Dagger et al.'s healthcare contextualization. However, two dimensions unique to the U.S. system—billing/insurance issues and overall positive experience—have no equivalent in Dagger et al.'s Australian single-payer-derived framework, revealing that even healthcare-specific models developed in one national context may inadequately capture dimensions salient in alternative system structures. The complete absence of financial dimensions from Dagger et al.'s (2007) framework reflects Australia's universal healthcare system, similar to Taiwan, demonstrating how institutional context shapes which quality aspects achieve dimension-level salience.

Third, **emergency care transcends frameworks as a universal healthcare priority** but operates differently from SERVQUAL's responsiveness. While SERVQUAL conceptualizes responsiveness as staff willingness to help promptly, emergency care in our data encompasses facility capacity, triage effectiveness, specialist availability, and system crowding—institutional factors beyond individual staff behavior. Emergency care's dominance (30.9% Taiwan, 34.8% USA) and its dramatic satisfaction gap (1.79 vs. 3.25 stars) demonstrate that structural system characteristics, not just service encounter qualities measured by SERVQUAL, fundamentally shape patient evaluations.

**Research Question 2: Which service quality dimensions represent universal concerns that transcend national boundaries, and which are country-specific?**

Through systematic cross-lingual semantic mapping, we identified four universal dimensions appearing in both countries with high or medium semantic similarity: (1) Emergency Care (High similarity), (2) Professional/Nursing Care (Medium similarity), (3) Outpatient Services (Medium similarity), and (4) Inpatient/Critical Care (Medium similarity). These four universal dimensions collectively account for approximately 78% of patient reviews in both countries, demonstrating that certain core healthcare concerns transcend national boundaries.

However, four country-specific dimensions emerged in only one country, accounting for approximately 22% of reviews. Taiwan exhibits two unique dimensions: Service Attitude Issues (17.3%, 1.69 stars) and Facility and Environment Quality (8.1%, 2.73 stars). The United States exhibits two unique dimensions: Billing and Insurance Issues (4.1%, 2.92 stars) and Overall Positive Experience (9.5%, 3.96 stars). These presence-versus-absence patterns demonstrate that national contexts—whether through healthcare system structure or cultural values—fundamentally shape which service aspects achieve dimension-level salience in patient evaluations.

This 78% universal, 22% country-specific split empirically resolves the longstanding debate in service quality research between etic (universal) and emic (culturally-specific) perspectives (Furrer et al., 2000; Donthu and Yoo, 1998). Rather than adopting an either-or stance, our findings support a hybrid model: core quality concerns operate universally, yet substantial portions of patient discourse address country-specific concerns requiring local contextualization. This finding extends Furrer et al.'s (2000) seventeen-country study, which found that while all cultures value all five SERVQUAL dimensions, their relative importance varies culturally—our results demonstrate an even stronger form of contingency where entire dimensions can emerge in one context yet remain absent in another.

**Research Question 3: What are the sources of cross-national differences in service quality dimensions, and through what mechanisms do healthcare system structures and cultural contexts shape these differences?**

Cross-national differences in service quality dimensions arise from two distinct sources, consistent with the theoretical frameworks established in Chapter 2. **Institutional sources** reflect healthcare system structure. The U.S. "Billing and Insurance Issues" dimension (4.1%) stems entirely from multi-payer complexity and is absent in Taiwan's single-payer system. This dimensional absence in Taiwan—where standardized, minimal copayments functionally eliminate financial considerations from care-seeking decisions (Cheng, 2015)—demonstrates what we term "system tax": satisfaction penalties imposed by multi-payer complexity independent of clinical quality. Administrative complaints also differ by system design—Taiwan focuses on process inefficiency (registration queuing, 6.9%), whereas the U.S. focuses on financial complexity (billing disputes, 4.1%). Both systems generate administrative dissatisfaction at similar proportions, but the nature of complaints reflects system design, consistent with Oliver's (1980) expectation-disconfirmation theory applied to institutional constraints.

**Cultural sources** reflect societal values and priorities, as theorized in Chapter 2's cross-cultural frameworks. Taiwan's distinct "Service Attitude Issues" dimension (17.3%, 1.69 stars) likely reflects collectivist East Asian cultures' heightened sensitivity to interpersonal treatment and harmony in social relationships (Hofstede, 1980, 2001). Furrer et al.'s (2000) finding that collectivist cultures rated empathy as most important (mean weight = 0.35 versus individualist cultures' reliability emphasis at 0.32) aligns with this dimensional salience. While U.S. reviews occasionally mention staff attitudes, these concerns remain embedded within other dimensions rather than coalescing into a separate evaluative dimension, demonstrating that cultural values determine which service aspects achieve dimension-level prominence. The U.S.'s significantly greater emphasis on emergency care (34.8% vs. 30.9%, χ²(1) = 13.74, p < .001) may reflect American cultural values emphasizing time efficiency and productivity, though both countries prioritize emergency care highly.

Critically, institutional and cultural sources interact rather than operating independently, as theorized in Section 2.3.3's culture-institution interaction framework. Taiwan's cultural emphasis on empathy and interpersonal warmth (Hofstede's femininity dimension; Furrer et al., 2000) combined with institutional constraints limiting consultations to three to five minutes (Tai-Seale et al., 2007; Cheng and Chiang, 2012) creates a larger expectation-disconfirmation gap than cultural preferences alone predict (Oliver, 1980). Taiwanese patients value communication (cultural expectation) but cannot receive adequate interaction time (institutional constraint), generating severe service attitude complaints (17.3% of discourse, 1.69 stars). This interaction effect demonstrates that institutional factors can amplify cultural expectations, producing magnified dissatisfaction when structural constraints prevent culturally-valued service delivery.

These sources shape patient quality perceptions through three distinct mechanisms. First, **dimensional composition through presence-versus-absence patterns**: healthcare system structure and cultural context determine which service aspects coalesce into distinct dimensions. The U.S. billing dimension and Taiwan's service attitude dimension exemplify this mechanism—each appears prominently in one country yet is entirely absent from the other, demonstrating that institutional and cultural forces determine which concerns achieve dimension-level salience rather than remaining latent or embedded within other constructs. This finding extends Dagger et al.'s (2007) healthcare quality model by revealing that dimensional structure itself varies institutionally and culturally, not merely dimension importance.

Second, **satisfaction levels within universal dimensions**: even when the same dimension appears in both countries, system structure influences satisfaction ratings. For emergency care—the only dimension achieving High semantic similarity permitting valid rating comparison—satisfaction diverges dramatically (Taiwan 1.79 stars vs. U.S. 3.25 stars, p < .001, d = 0.782). This 1.46-star gap suggests Taiwan's universal access generates higher demand including non-urgent cases, creating severe overcrowding (14.2 annual visits per capita versus 4.0 in the U.S.; OECD Health Statistics, 2022), while the U.S. system's financial barriers maintain lower relative utilization despite continued wait time complaints (Tikkanen et al., 2020). Berry and Bendapudi's (2007) observation that healthcare involves involuntary consumption and constrained choice helps explain why emergency care dominates both countries' discourse—patients cannot defer emergency needs despite system-imposed barriers (financial in the U.S., crowding in Taiwan).

Third, **differential emphasis on shared concerns**: both countries address emergency care and administrative processes, but the nature and intensity of complaints reflect system-specific pain points. Single-payer systems standardize pricing but face high-volume queuing (Taiwan's registration dimension), while multi-payer systems maintain lower facility utilization but impose financial navigation burdens (U.S. billing dimension). This mechanism demonstrates that even when conceptually similar dimensions exist, their operational manifestation and patient evaluation differ systematically by institutional context, consistent with Donabedian's (1988) structure-process-outcome framework where system structures (single- versus multi-payer) shape care processes (volume pressure versus financial screening), influencing patient-perceived outcomes (rushed consultations versus cost barriers).

## Contributions to Theory and Practice

This research makes contributions across theoretical, practical, and methodological domains, advancing understanding established in Chapter 2's theoretical foundations.

**Theoretically**, we reconcile the longstanding debate between universal and culturally-contingent perspectives in service quality research (Furrer et al., 2000; Donthu and Yoo, 1998; Brady and Cronin, 2001). Rather than adopting an either-or stance, our findings support a hybrid model: core quality concerns (emergency care, professional competence, administrative processes) operate universally, appearing spontaneously in patient discourse regardless of system structure or cultural context, yet the specific dimensional configuration requires substantial institutional and cultural contextualization. This finding extends Parasuraman et al.'s (1988) SERVQUAL by demonstrating that while generic dimensions (tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, empathy) manifest universally, their empirical fragmentation into patient-salient dimensions follows country-specific patterns. Our contribution lies in empirically quantifying universality (78% of discourse) versus contingency (22% of discourse), providing the first cross-national evidence of this hybrid structure in healthcare settings using identical unsupervised methods.

We introduce the concept of "system tax" to describe how multi-payer healthcare systems impose satisfaction penalties independent of clinical quality—billing and insurance issues constitute 4.1% of U.S. discourse yet are entirely absent from Taiwan's single-payer structure, representing an entire dimension of dissatisfaction that universal coverage systems eliminate by design. This concept extends beyond Cheng's (2015) documentation of Taiwan's NHI achieving universal access, demonstrating that single-payer systems not only expand coverage but fundamentally alter patient quality evaluations by removing an entire category of concerns. The "system tax" concept provides theoretical language for understanding how financing mechanisms shape service quality perceptions independently of care delivery quality, advancing institutional theory in healthcare services (Scott, 2008).

Our findings demonstrate that institutional effects dominate dimensional composition (determining which quality aspects coalesce into distinct dimensions), while cultural effects primarily shape evaluation standards within dimensions (how patients rate dimensions once salient). Taiwan's service attitude dimension and the U.S.'s billing dimension exemplify institutional determination—financing structure creates or eliminates entire evaluative categories. This finding advances Hofstede's (1980, 2001) cultural dimensions theory by demonstrating institutional structure's primacy over cultural values in shaping dimensional salience, qualifying Furrer et al.'s (2000) conclusion that culture determines dimension importance. Culture certainly matters—Taiwan's collectivism likely elevates service attitude concerns to dimensional status—but institutional constraints (three-to-five-minute consultations) interact with cultural expectations (interpersonal warmth) to generate the observed pattern. Our dual-source framework clarifies when institutions dominate (dimensional presence-absence) versus when culture matters (evaluation intensity within existing dimensions).

**Practically**, our findings provide actionable guidance for hospital administrators and health policymakers. For Taiwan, emergency care transformation should be the highest priority given its dominance (30.9% of reviews) and exceptionally low satisfaction (1.79 stars). Recommended interventions include implementing advanced triage systems to separate urgent from non-urgent cases, expanding emergency department capacity through dedicated staffing rather than relying on inpatient ward physicians, improving patient communication about wait times and treatment sequences, developing fast-track systems for minor ailments, and strengthening emergency-inpatient integration to reduce boarding times. These interventions address the structural volume pressure documented in Section 2.3.1 (Cheng and Chiang, 2012). Service attitude training represents the second priority (17.3%, 1.69 stars), requiring both symptom-focused interventions (interpersonal communication training for healthcare workers) and cause-focused interventions addressing the root problem—reducing healthcare worker burnout through improved staffing ratios and workload management that enable consultation times sufficient for meaningful patient interaction beyond current three-to-five-minute constraints (Tai-Seale et al., 2007).

For the United States, hospitals should address billing transparency and simplification to mitigate the "system tax" burden, including providing upfront cost estimates before procedures, assigning patient financial counselors to explain coverage and payment options, simplifying billing statements to enhance comprehensibility, and establishing clear appeals processes for disputed charges. These interventions address the financial barriers documented in Section 2.3.2 affecting 45% of adults who delay care due to cost (Commonwealth Fund, 2020). U.S. emergency care, while rated higher than Taiwan (3.25 stars), still represents the largest dimension (34.8%) and warrants continued attention through capacity expansion and process improvement. The twenty-four-day average wait for primary care appointments (Merritt Hawkins, 2017) suggests that access barriers may redirect non-urgent cases to emergency departments, similar to Taiwan's pattern but through different mechanisms—delayed primary access versus unrestricted emergency access.

Policymakers face system-level challenges requiring coordinated action beyond individual hospital initiatives. Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare should develop national emergency care standards including mandatory staffing ratios based on patient volume, financial incentives for hospitals achieving emergency satisfaction targets, and enhanced primary care access to reduce emergency department misuse for non-urgent conditions. U.S. policymakers should accelerate price transparency regulations following the 2021 Hospital Price Transparency Rule, standardize insurance explanation of benefits documents to reduce comprehension barriers, prohibit surprise billing for emergency and in-network care, and streamline prior authorization processes that delay care. Both countries should recognize emergency care as a universal challenge suitable for international cooperation, including cross-national best practice exchanges and jointly funded research on emergency department management innovations, given that emergency care emerged as the dominant concern transcending system boundaries.

**Methodologically**, we advance cross-cultural text analysis through three innovations building on the theoretical foundations established in Chapter 2. First, our integrated topic number selection framework balances statistical coherence and perplexity with semantic interpretability by domain experts and theoretical alignment with established service quality frameworks (SERVQUAL, Dagger et al.'s model), providing a replicable template for applied LDA research where statistical optima frequently diverge from practical utility. This framework addresses Steenkamp and Baumgartner's (1998) measurement equivalence concerns in cross-cultural research by allowing dimensional structures to emerge independently in each language before assessing semantic similarity, avoiding the imposition of predetermined constructs that may lack cultural validity.

Second, our systematic cross-lingual semantic mapping protocol enables comparison while respecting linguistic differences through independent LDA extraction in each language, explicit similarity classification (High/Medium/Low based on >70%, 50-70%, <50% thematic overlap), and tiered comparison strategies matched to similarity levels—presence-versus-absence comparisons for all dimensions, proportion differences for universal dimensions, and rating comparisons only for High-similarity dimensions. This protocol addresses the fundamental methodological challenge that statistical significance does not justify cross-national rating comparisons when dimensions measure substantively different constructs. Our approach operationalizes the theoretical concern raised in Section 2.2.3 that cross-cultural surveys face item equivalence challenges (Steenkamp and Baumgartner, 1998), providing a rigorous alternative that discovers equivalence empirically rather than assuming it a priori.

Third, our multi-method topic validation framework triangulates evidence from representative text analysis (95% alignment rate), keyword overlap analysis (mean overlap 16%, below 20% discrimination threshold), internal consistency assessment (mean topic probabilities 0.60-0.71), and theoretical alignment with SERVQUAL and Dagger et al.'s frameworks (Table 5.1 demonstrates complete mapping), providing substantially stronger validation than the common practice of relying solely on keyword inspection. This validation framework addresses Berry and Bendapudi's (2007) observation that healthcare's credence good nature (patients cannot fully assess technical quality) necessitates rigorous methods to ensure that discovered dimensions reflect genuine patient priorities rather than methodological artifacts.

## Limitations and Future Research

This study's limitations suggest directions for future research. First, Google Maps reviewers represent a self-selected sample potentially biased toward younger, technologically proficient, and strongly satisfied or dissatisfied patients (extremity bias), with the bi-modal rating distribution (high concentration at 1-star and 5-star) suggesting polarized feedback. Our focus on top-tier hospitals (Taiwan's 26 medical centers, U.S. News top-28 hospitals) limits generalizability to community hospitals or rural facilities where resource constraints may shift priorities differently. Berry and Bendapudi (2007) note that healthcare service experiences vary dramatically by setting—emergency departments versus elective surgery, teaching hospitals versus community facilities—suggesting our elite hospital findings may not generalize to broader healthcare contexts. Future research should employ multi-method data collection combining online reviews with structured surveys and patient interviews to validate findings across data sources, and expand sampling to include community hospitals to test whether the 78% universal, 22% country-specific pattern holds beyond elite institutions or whether community settings generate additional country-specific dimensions.

Second, our cross-sectional design (July 2024 data collection, reviews spanning 2018-2024) captures a snapshot of patient sentiment but cannot identify temporal trends or establish causality. Healthcare systems evolve—Taiwan's NHI implemented reforms including global budget adjustments and quality-based payment pilots, while U.S. price transparency regulations changed disclosure requirements (Tikkanen et al., 2020)—yet we cannot assess how these policy changes influenced dimensions or satisfaction over time. The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly disrupted healthcare delivery, potentially altering patient priorities (infection control, telemedicine access) in ways our data cannot disentangle from pre-pandemic patterns. Longitudinal research tracking how dimensions evolve over policy implementation periods would reveal whether dimensional structures are stable or dynamic, how specific reforms influence particular quality priorities, and whether pandemic-induced changes persist or revert to pre-pandemic patterns.

Third, LDA's inherent limitations constrain interpretation despite our rigorous validation framework. Topic number selection (K) required subjective judgment even with our integrated framework balancing statistical metrics, interpretability, and theoretical alignment—different researchers might reasonably select alternative K values yielding different interpretations. Topic labels, although validated through multiple methods (Table 5.1's framework alignment, 95% representative text alignment, keyword discrimination analysis), required interpretive judgment—alternative labels emphasizing different nuances might be equally defensible for multi-faceted topics. LDA's bag-of-words assumption discards word order and contextual meaning, limiting semantic sophistication compared to newer neural approaches. Future research could employ complementary methods—structural topic models incorporating covariates (system type, hospital characteristics), neural topic models leveraging word embeddings for semantic relationships, or transformer-based models enabling context-aware analysis—though these sacrifice LDA's advantage of unsupervised discovery without predetermined categories that we prioritized to avoid imposing Western frameworks on non-Western patient discourse.

Fourth, our bilingual analysis (Chinese, English) enabled cross-cultural comparison but simplified cultural complexity within each country. Taiwan represents one East Asian cultural context, but East Asian cultures vary substantially—Japan's high uncertainty avoidance (92) differs from Taiwan's moderate-high (69), while South Korea's individualism (18) resembles Taiwan's (17) but mainland China's (20) operates under different political institutions (Hofstede, 2001). The United States contains substantial internal diversity across regions (Southern hospitality cultures versus Northeastern efficiency orientations), racial/ethnic groups (collectivist immigrant communities versus individualist mainstream culture), and urban-rural divides. Our analysis treats each country as culturally homogeneous, potentially obscuring important within-country variation that Furrer et al.'s (2000) within-country analyses revealed. Future cross-cultural research should expand to multiple countries within cultural clusters (East Asia: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China; West: USA, UK, Canada, Australia) to distinguish cultural patterns from country-specific idiosyncrasies, testing whether Taiwan-USA differences reflect individualism-collectivism dimensions generalizing across cultural clusters or unique institutional features of these particular systems.

Despite these limitations, our findings demonstrate the value of combining unsupervised machine learning with cross-cultural research methods to discover how institutional structures and cultural values jointly shape patient quality perceptions. Future research directions include: expanding cross-national comparison to additional countries to test whether Taiwan-USA patterns generalize, particularly comparing multiple single-payer systems (Taiwan, UK, Canada) and multiple multi-payer systems (USA, Switzerland, Netherlands) to isolate system effects from country-specific factors; linking patient review data to clinical outcomes (mortality rates, readmission rates), hospital characteristics (teaching status, ownership type), and regional socioeconomic indicators for multi-level analysis explaining why some hospitals achieve high satisfaction within the same system structure; and conducting experimental or quasi-experimental studies manipulating specific dimensions (reducing emergency wait times through capacity expansion, enhancing service attitude through training interventions) to test causal mechanisms our cross-sectional data can only suggest, moving from correlation to causation in understanding service quality determinants.

## Concluding Remarks

This research demonstrates that patient-perceived healthcare service quality exhibits both universality and contingency. While emergency care, professional competence, and administrative processes represent universal concerns appearing across dramatically different healthcare systems, the specific dimensional structure through which patients organize their quality evaluations reflects system structure and cultural context. Multi-payer healthcare systems impose a "system tax"—billing and insurance dimensions—that single-payer systems eliminate by design, whereas single-payer systems accepting all patients may face infrastructure strain (facility crowding) and interpersonal challenges (service attitude problems from healthcare worker burnout) less prominent in systems with financial access barriers limiting utilization. These findings extend service quality theory (Parasuraman et al., 1988; Dagger et al., 2007), cross-cultural research (Hofstede, 1980; Furrer et al., 2000), and healthcare systems analysis (Cheng, 2015; Berry and Bendapudi, 2007) by empirically demonstrating how generic quality frameworks require context-specific instantiation.

The policy implications are clear: emergency care requires both universal solutions (improved triage, expanded capacity, better communication) applicable across systems and system-specific solutions (Taiwan: demand management through enhanced primary care; USA: financial barrier reduction to prevent delayed care leading to emergency presentations). International cooperation on emergency care best practices could benefit all health systems given the shared nature of this challenge. However, system-specific dimensions require tailored interventions—billing transparency and simplification for multi-payer systems to reduce the "system tax" burden, service attitude training and healthcare worker protection for single-payer high-volume systems to address expectation-disconfirmation gaps created by culture-institution interactions.

As healthcare systems worldwide grapple with quality improvement amid financial constraints and aging populations, understanding which quality challenges are universal and which are system-specific becomes essential for effective resource allocation and international learning. Our findings suggest that while all health systems can learn from each other's approaches to universal challenges like emergency care management and professional excellence, system-specific challenges require solutions tailored to institutional and cultural contexts rather than wholesale importation of foreign practices. The future of healthcare quality research lies in hybrid approaches that recognize both commonality and contingency across the world's diverse healthcare systems, employing data-driven methods that allow patient priorities to emerge authentically rather than imposing predetermined Western frameworks on non-Western populations. By combining the rigor of unsupervised machine learning with the depth of cross-cultural research methods grounded in established theory, we can build truly global understanding of healthcare quality that respects both universal human needs and culturally-specific values.
