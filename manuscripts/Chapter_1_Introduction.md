# 1. Introduction

Healthcare service quality remains one of the most pressing challenges facing health systems worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, inadequate quality of care contributes to millions of preventable patient harms annually, with significant variations observed across countries and healthcare systems (WHO, 2020). While substantial research has examined healthcare quality within individual nations, a critical question remains largely unanswered: Do patients in different healthcare systems—particularly those with fundamentally different organizational structures—prioritize the same service quality dimensions? Understanding these cross-national patterns is essential for identifying universal healthcare challenges that transcend system boundaries, while also recognizing that healthcare system structure and cultural context may generate entirely distinct quality dimensions that emerge in one context yet remain absent in another. Distinguishing universal from system-specific quality dimensions has profound implications—universal challenges enable international best practice transfer and collaborative solutions, whereas system-specific dimensions require interventions tailored to particular institutional and cultural contexts.

The contrast between Taiwan's single-payer National Health Insurance system and the United States' multi-payer, market-based system provides an ideal natural experiment for examining how healthcare system structure influences patient quality perceptions. Although both nations achieve high healthcare outcomes by international standards, their patients navigate vastly different care delivery and financing mechanisms. Taiwan's NHI system provides universal coverage through a government-administered insurance program with standardized fee schedules, effectively removing financial barriers to healthcare access. In contrast, the U.S. system operates through a complex mix of private insurance, employer-sponsored plans, and government programs (Medicare, Medicaid), creating substantial variation in coverage, out-of-pocket costs, and access barriers. These structural differences create divergent constraints and enablers that may fundamentally shape which service quality aspects patients evaluate—financial complexity and insurance navigation may constitute central concerns in multi-payer systems yet remain entirely absent where single-payer systems eliminate such barriers (potentially representing what we might term a "system tax" on patient satisfaction), while universal access systems may face capacity and crowding challenges less prominent in systems with financial gatekeeping. Understanding how system structure shapes dimensional composition—not merely dimension importance—represents a critical yet underexplored theoretical question with substantial policy implications.

Prior research has confirmed that Taiwan-USA healthcare system differences generate distinct patient experience patterns. Yoon and Cheng's (2021) large-scale comparison of 1,374 hospitals (350 in Taiwan, 1,024 in the United States) using standardized patient satisfaction surveys found that perceived inpatient care quality was significantly higher in the United States across multiple dimensions. More importantly, they discovered that the association between regional socioeconomic status and patient satisfaction exhibited opposite patterns: in Taiwan, higher socioeconomic regions showed lower satisfaction (ORs = 0.83-0.88), while in the United States, higher socioeconomic regions showed higher satisfaction (ORs = 1.48-2.51). Yoon and Cheng (2021) attributed these contrasting patterns to systemic and cultural differences between the two countries. However, their study examined only three predetermined satisfaction dimensions using structured surveys, leaving unexplored what additional service quality dimensions might emerge when patients express concerns in their own words, and whether the specific dimensional structure itself—beyond satisfaction levels within dimensions—varies between these healthcare systems.

Traditional healthcare quality assessment relies predominantly on structured instruments such as SERVQUAL (Parasuraman et al., 1988) and healthcare-adapted variants (Dagger et al., 2007). While these instruments provide standardized measurement, they suffer from systematic limitations that are particularly problematic in cross-cultural research. First, researcher-imposed frameworks constrain patient expression to predetermined dimensions that may not capture culture-specific priorities or emerging concerns (Carman, 1990). Second, cross-cultural translation introduces measurement non-equivalence, with survey items carrying different connotations across languages and response styles varying systematically by culture (Harzing, 2006). Third, social desirability bias may suppress honest criticism, particularly in cultures emphasizing social harmony and respect for authority. Finally, the temporal lag between survey design and data collection means findings may be outdated before publication, which is especially problematic in rapidly evolving healthcare systems.

The proliferation of online patient reviews on platforms like Google Maps presents methodological opportunities to address these limitations. These unsolicited patient narratives offer several advantages: authenticity (no researcher prompting or framing), immediacy (real-time patient sentiment), scale (thousands of reviews enabling robust statistical analysis), cross-cultural comparability (identical platform mechanisms across countries), and richness (contextual details and emotional intensity often absent from structured surveys) (Ranard et al., 2016). However, extracting service quality dimensions from massive volumes of unstructured, multilingual narratives requires analytical methods that avoid imposing predetermined frameworks while enabling rigorous cross-national comparison.

Three critical gaps constrain theoretical advancement and practical application. First, existing healthcare quality research remains predominantly single-country in focus, with limited cross-national studies employing different methodologies that make direct comparison problematic (Fung et al., 2008). No prior study has applied identical analytical methods to patient-generated data across drastically different healthcare systems to systematically identify universal versus country-specific dimensions. Without such systematic comparison, we cannot determine what proportion of patient quality discourse addresses universal versus system-specific concerns.

Second, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)—an unsupervised machine learning approach that extracts latent themes from large text corpora without researcher-imposed categories (Blei et al., 2003)—remains underutilized in healthcare contexts and exceedingly rare in cross-lingual applications. While LDA has been increasingly applied to hospitality and retail service reviews, no prior study has developed a systematic framework for applying LDA across Chinese and English hospital reviews to enable semantic mapping and cross-cultural comparison.

Third, service quality theory contains a fundamental unresolved tension: Are quality dimensions universal across cultures and contexts, or are they fundamentally shaped by cultural values and system structures (Brady and Cronin, 2001)? Existing research has not empirically quantified the balance between universality and contingency—we lack evidence on what proportion of patient-perceived quality dimensions transcend national boundaries versus reflecting country-specific institutional and cultural factors. Moreover, we do not know whether country-specific dimensions reflect primarily system structure versus cultural values, as most studies confound these sources by comparing only pairs of countries.

This study addresses these three gaps through a comparative analysis of patient reviews from Taiwan and the United States. We pose three research questions: (1) What service quality dimensions emerge from patient reviews of hospitals in Taiwan versus the United States when analyzed using identical unsupervised topic modeling methods? (2) Which service quality dimensions represent universal concerns that transcend national boundaries, and which are country-specific? (3) What are the sources of cross-national differences in service quality dimensions, and through what mechanisms do healthcare system structures and cultural contexts shape these differences?

To answer these questions, we collected 5,007 patient reviews from Taiwan's 26 leading medical centers and 3,240 reviews from 28 top-ranked U.S. hospitals, all obtained from Google Maps. We applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling independently to each language corpus, then conducted cross-lingual semantic mapping to identify universal dimensions appearing in both countries versus country-specific dimensions. This approach enables us to empirically quantify what proportion of patient quality discourse addresses universal versus system-specific concerns, determine whether country-specific dimensions reflect primarily institutional structure or cultural values, and identify which service quality dimensions transcend system boundaries versus those that emerge in one context yet remain entirely absent in another.

The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Chapter 2 reviews relevant literature on service quality theory, cross-cultural healthcare research, healthcare systems comparison, online reviews as data sources, and topic modeling applications. Chapter 3 details our data collection procedures, text preprocessing for Chinese and English corpora, LDA modeling approach, cross-lingual semantic mapping protocol, and statistical testing methods. Chapter 4 presents extracted quality dimensions for each country, cross-national comparisons revealing universal and country-specific patterns, and statistical tests quantifying differences. Chapter 5 presents conclusions addressing the three research questions, theoretical and practical contributions, methodological innovations, study limitations, and directions for future research.
