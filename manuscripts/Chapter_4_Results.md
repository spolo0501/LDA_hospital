# Chapter 4: Results

This chapter presents findings from our cross-national LDA analysis of 5,007 Chinese-language patient reviews from Taiwan and 3,240 English-language reviews from the United States. We describe the service quality dimensions that emerged from each country (Section 4.1), conduct systematic cross-national comparison to identify universal versus system-specific dimensions (Section 4.2), and perform statistical testing to quantify cross-national differences (Section 4.3).

## 4.1 Service Quality Dimensions by Country

### 4.1.1 Taiwan's Seven-Dimensional Structure (K=7)

Our LDA analysis revealed seven distinct service quality dimensions (Coherence = 0.4175; Perplexity = -7.5039). We selected K=7 over K=5 (despite K=5's higher coherence of 0.4326) because the seven-topic solution successfully isolated "Facility and Environment Quality" and provided clearer separation between surgical specialty care and general professional quality, aligning with healthcare service quality theory's multi-dimensional framework (Brady & Cronin, 2001). Table 4.1 summarizes Taiwan's service quality structure.

**[Table 4.1: Taiwan Hospital Service Quality Dimensions (K=7)]**

| Topic | Dimension Name | Proportion | Avg Rating | Top-10 Keywords (English Translation) |
|-------|---------------|------------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Topic 1** | Medical Professional Quality<br>醫療專業品質 | **27.2%** | **4.67** | physician, nurse, professional, thank you, gratitude, doctor, kind, medical, patient, staff |
| **Topic 2** | Registration & Billing Process<br>掛號批價流程 | 6.9% | 1.83 | time, registration, consultation, appointment, payment, medication pickup, afternoon, clinic |
| **Topic 3** | Service Attitude Issues<br>服務態度問題 | 17.3% | **1.69** | attitude, patient, nurse, staff, not, blood draw, examination, registration, impatient |
| **Topic 4** | Facility & Environment Quality<br>環境設施品質 | 8.1% | 2.73 | time, parking lot, convenient, consultation, waiting, parking, elevator, center, flow |
| **Topic 5** | Surgical & Specialty Care<br>手術專科表現 | 5.3% | 4.02 | physician, surgery, thank you, operation, surgery dept, nurse, orthopedics, treatment |
| **Topic 6** | Inpatient Care Experience<br>住院照護經驗 | 4.3% | 2.35 | ward, hospitalization, family, patient, nurse, discharge, doctor, relatives, surgery |
| **Topic 7** | Emergency Medical Services<br>急診醫療服務 | **30.9%** | **1.79** | doctor, we, emergency, patient, know, not, issue, nurse, examination, one |

Emergency care dominates Taiwanese patient discourse (30.9%, n=1,546) yet receives the lowest satisfaction rating (1.79 stars), suggesting that Taiwan's single-payer NHI system faces severe challenges in managing emergency department demand. The removal of financial barriers leads to high utilization rates and overcrowding. In sharp contrast, medical professional quality—the second-largest dimension (27.2%, n=1,361)—receives the highest rating (4.67 stars), with keywords emphasizing gratitude ("感謝", "謝謝"), kindness ("親切"), and professionalism ("專業"). This exceptionally high rating likely reflects Taiwan's high power distance culture fostering respect for medical authority (Hofstede, 2001).

Service attitude problems emerge as a distinct dimension (17.3%, 1.69 stars), indicating Taiwanese patients' heightened sensitivity to perceived impoliteness or impatience from healthcare workers. This sensitivity reflects both cultural expectations—collectivism emphasizes interpersonal harmony—and systemic pressures from high patient volume leading to healthcare worker burnout. Facility and environment quality (8.1%, 2.73 stars) addresses infrastructure strain: parking scarcity, crowded facilities, and restroom cleanliness issues. Registration and billing processes (6.9%, 1.83 stars) reflects administrative inefficiencies—long queues at multiple service counters—though patients notably complain about process delays rather than financial burden, as the NHI's standardized fee schedule keeps out-of-pocket costs minimal.

### 4.1.2 USA's Six-Dimensional Structure (K=6)

Analysis of U.S. reviews identified six distinct dimensions (Coherence = 0.4029; Perplexity = -7.2254). K=6 achieved the highest coherence among alternatives and successfully isolated the theoretically important "Billing and Insurance" dimension. Table 4.2 summarizes the findings.

**[Table 4.2: USA Hospital Service Quality Dimensions (K=6)]**

| Topic | Dimension Name | Proportion | Avg Rating | Top-10 Keywords |
|-------|---------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Topic 1** | Critical Care & Family Support<br>重症照護與家庭關懷 | 16.4% | 3.29 | care, dad, life, patient, time, room, scan, year, surgery, could |
| **Topic 2** | Emergency & Waiting Time<br>急診等待時間問題 | **34.8%** | 3.25 | room, patient, **hour**, time, waiting, nurse, emergency, care, day, back |
| **Topic 3** | Outpatient Care Services<br>門診醫療服務 | 14.7% | 3.08 | care, clinic, doctor, even, help, pain, never, cleveland, told, know |
| **Topic 4** | Nursing Care Quality<br>護理照護品質 | 20.5% | **3.00** | nurse, care, patient, time, hour, room, day, even, left, blood |
| **Topic 5** | Overall Positive Experience<br>整體正面評價 | 9.5% | **3.96** | care, staff, **great**, **thank**, team, doctor, experience, **best**, surgery |
| **Topic 6** | Billing & Insurance Issues<br>帳單保險問題 | 4.1% | 2.92 | appointment, **bill**, service, time, **billing**, **insurance**, patient, month, care, told |

Emergency care constitutes the largest dimension in U.S. discourse (34.8%, n=1,128), exceeding Taiwan's 30.9%. However, American patients rate emergency care significantly higher (3.25 vs. 1.79 stars), with statistical testing confirming this 1.46-star difference is highly significant (t(2672) = 19.97, p < 0.001, d = 0.782). The keyword "hour" indicates American patients explicitly quantify waiting times, reflecting individualistic culture's time-conscious orientation (Hall, 1976). The multi-payer system's access barriers likely maintain lower patient volume relative to capacity, reducing wait times compared to Taiwan's universal-access system.

Nursing care quality emerges as a distinct dimension constituting one-fifth of U.S. patient discourse (20.5%, 3.00 stars). The isolation of nursing care as a standalone dimension—separate from physician quality—contrasts with Taiwan's unified professional quality dimension (27.2%, 4.67 stars) that evaluates physicians and nurses together. American patient complaints focus on nursing responsiveness and availability, with top keywords including "nurse," "time," "hour," "left," suggesting concerns about staffing adequacy and timely care delivery. This dimensional structure likely reflects documented U.S. nursing shortages and high nurse-to-patient ratios that compromise bedside care (Aiken et al., 2002). However, direct rating comparison between U.S. nursing care (3.00 stars) and Taiwan's combined professional quality (4.67 stars) is methodologically problematic due to different referents (nurses only versus physicians+nurses) and different evaluation criteria (responsiveness versus respect/gratitude), as discussed in Section 4.2.3.

Most critically, billing and insurance issues emerge as a standalone dimension (4.1%, n=132, 2.92 stars)—a dimension entirely absent from Taiwan's structure. Patients describe surprise medical bills, insurance coverage denials, and prior authorization delays: "Insurance should have covered this but they refuse", "Surprise bill of $8,000 after procedure". This presence-versus-absence comparison provides definitive evidence that healthcare financing structure fundamentally shapes which service quality dimensions patients attend to, demonstrating strong institutional effects on dimensional composition.

## 4.2 Cross-National Comparison: Universal and System-Specific Dimensions

To address Research Question 2—which dimensions represent universal concerns versus system-specific concerns—we conducted systematic semantic mapping across languages despite different optimal K values (Taiwan K=7 vs. USA K=6). We assessed similarity using three criteria: keyword overlap, thematic content analysis, and semantic focus, classifying dimensions as High (>70% overlap), Medium (50-70%), or Low (<50%) similarity.

### 4.2.1 Universal Dimensions

Table 4.3 presents the semantic mapping revealing four universal dimensions that appeared in both countries, collectively accounting for approximately 78% of patient reviews.

**[Table 4.3: Taiwan-USA Semantic Mapping of Universal Dimensions]**

| Universal Dimension | Taiwan Topic | USA Topic | Similarity | Taiwan % (Rating) | USA % (Rating) | Δ Rating | Statistical Significance |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|----------------|----------|-------------------------|
| **Emergency Care** | Topic 7<br>急診醫療服務 | Topic 2<br>Emergency & Waiting | **High** | 30.9% (1.79) | 34.8% (3.25) | **+1.46** | t(2672)=19.97, p<.001***, d=0.782 |
| **Professional/Nursing Care** | Topic 1<br>醫療專業品質 | Topic 4<br>Nursing Care | Medium | 27.2% (4.67) | 20.5% (3.00) | **-1.67** | (t=18.84, p<.001, d=0.892)† |
| **Outpatient Services** | Topic 2<br>掛號批價流程 | Topic 3<br>Outpatient Care | Medium | 6.9% (1.83) | 14.7% (3.08) | **+1.25** | (t=9.43, p<.001, d=0.667)† |
| **Inpatient/Critical Care** | Topic 6<br>住院照護經驗 | Topic 1<br>Critical Care & Family | Medium | 4.3% (2.35) | 16.4% (3.29) | **+0.94** | (t=6.36, p<.001, d=0.512)† |

***Note**: All rating differences show statistical significance (p < .001). †Medium-similarity dimensions have different semantic foci; rating comparisons reported for descriptive purposes but not used for formal statistical testing (see Section 4.2.3). Only Emergency Care (High similarity) supports valid cross-national rating comparison.

**Emergency Care: A Universal Challenge with System-Dependent Outcomes.** Emergency care represents the strongest evidence for dimensional universality—accounting for 30.9% of Taiwan reviews and 34.8% of U.S. reviews—yet system structure exerts profound influence on satisfaction. Statistical analysis confirms the 1.46-star gap is highly significant (p < .001) with a medium-to-large effect size (d = 0.782), demonstrating this is a systematic difference rather than sampling variation. Taiwan's single-payer system removes financial barriers, potentially leading to higher utilization including non-urgent cases, resulting in severe overcrowding and the lowest satisfaction rating in our entire dataset (1.79 stars). American patients, facing substantial emergency room bills even with insurance, may use services more selectively for truly urgent conditions, maintaining lower patient volume and higher satisfaction (3.25 stars) despite continued complaints about wait times.

**Professional/Nursing Care: Different Semantic Foci.** Both countries feature a dimension addressing healthcare worker competence, but with critical differences. Taiwan combines physicians and nurses into unified "Medical Professional Quality" (4.67 stars), with keywords emphasizing gratitude ("thank you," "gratitude") and professionalism. The U.S. isolates nursing care as a standalone dimension (3.00 stars), with keywords emphasizing responsiveness ("left," "time," "hour") and staffing concerns. The 1.67-star gap, while statistically significant (p < .001, d = 0.892), reflects Medium semantic similarity—Taiwan evaluates physicians+nurses focusing on respect and competence, while the U.S. evaluates nurses focusing on responsiveness and availability. These dimensions measure partially different constructs (different personnel, different evaluation criteria), complicating direct rating comparison. The presence of Taiwan's separate "Service Attitude Issues" dimension (17.3%, 1.69 stars)—discussed in Section 4.3—provides cleaner evidence for cultural differences in interpersonal quality expectations.

**Outpatient and Inpatient Services: Different Focal Concerns.** While both countries feature outpatient and inpatient dimensions, their emphases diverge. Taiwan's outpatient topic (6.9%, 1.83 stars) focuses on administrative inefficiencies (registration queues, billing counters, process delays), whereas U.S. outpatient discourse (14.7%, 3.08 stars) emphasizes clinical quality and appointment access barriers ("doctor," "clinic," "help," "pain"). Similarly, Taiwan's inpatient dimension addresses routine hospitalizations and visitation policies (4.3%, 2.35 stars; keywords: "ward," "hospitalization," "discharge"), while U.S. discourse concentrates on critical care and family emotions during life-threatening illnesses (16.4%, 3.29 stars; keywords: "dad," "life," "ICU," "scan"). These dimensions achieve only Medium semantic similarity due to differing focal concerns, limiting the interpretability of rating comparisons despite statistical significance (outpatient: p < .001, d = 0.667; inpatient: p < .001, d = 0.512).

Chi-square testing confirms that the emergency care proportion difference (34.8% vs. 30.9%) is statistically significant despite the modest 3.9 percentage point gap: χ²(1) = 13.74, p < .001, Cramér's V = 0.041. The statistical significance despite small effect size reflects large sample sizes (n = 8,247 total reviews) and indicates a genuine, replicable cross-national difference consistent with American culture's greater emphasis on efficiency and time consciousness.

### 4.2.2 System-Specific Dimensions

Beyond the four universal dimensions, four dimensions emerged in only one country, providing compelling evidence that healthcare system structure and cultural context shape which service aspects coalesce into distinct topics. Table 4.4 summarizes these system-specific dimensions.

**[Table 4.4: System-Specific Service Quality Dimensions]**

| Country | Dimension | Proportion | Rating | Interpretation |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Taiwan Only** | Service Attitude Issues<br>服務態度問題 | 17.3% | 1.69 | Heightened cultural sensitivity to interpersonal treatment; absent as standalone U.S. dimension |
| **Taiwan Only** | Facility & Environment<br>環境設施品質 | 8.1% | 2.73 | Infrastructure strain from single-payer system's high utilization; absent in U.S. data |
| **USA Only** | Billing & Insurance<br>帳單保險問題 | 4.1% | 2.92 | Multi-payer complexity; **entirely absent** from Taiwan's single-payer structure |
| **USA Only** | Overall Positive Experience<br>整體正面評價 | 9.5% | 3.96 | Distinct "praise" dimension reflecting American review culture |

**Taiwan-Specific: Service Attitude and Facility Strain.** Service attitude issues (17.3%, 1.69 stars)—Taiwan's third-largest and lowest-rated dimension—does not appear as a standalone U.S. topic. Taiwan's high power distance and collectivist culture create heightened sensitivity to perceived rudeness or impatience from healthcare workers. When staff violate cultural norms of respect and harmony, patients experience this as egregious service failure. Facility and environment quality (8.1%, 2.73 stars) addresses parking scarcity, crowded facilities, and restroom cleanliness—infrastructure strain resulting from the single-payer system's high utilization rates. U.S. data lack equivalent dimensions, suggesting the multi-payer system's access barriers maintain lower facility utilization relative to capacity.

**USA-Specific: Billing Complexity and Praise Dimensions.** Two distinct U.S.-only dimensions reveal institutional and cultural influences. Billing and insurance issues (4.1%, 2.92 stars) provide the most definitive evidence that healthcare financing structure shapes patient quality perceptions. This dimension—characterized by surprise medical bills, insurance coverage denials, and billing errors—is entirely absent from Taiwan's structure. Taiwan's NHI uses uniform fee schedules and standardized coverage rules, eliminating the complexity and financial uncertainty that dominate American discourse. This presence-versus-absence comparison supports our concept of "system tax": multi-payer healthcare systems impose satisfaction penalties on patients independent of clinical care quality. Even at America's top-ranked hospitals, 4.1% of patient discourse centers on financial and administrative burdens created purely by system structure, representing an entire dimension of dissatisfaction that single-payer systems eliminate.

The "Overall Positive Experience" dimension (9.5%, 3.96 stars) represents a distinct pattern of unreserved praise absent from Taiwan's structure. With keywords emphasizing superlatives ("great," "best," "excellent") and gratitude ("thank," "thanks"), this dimension reflects American review culture's tendency toward polarized evaluations—patients who are highly satisfied write effusive praise as a distinct category of feedback. Taiwan's reviews integrate positive evaluations within specific quality dimensions (professional quality, surgical care) rather than coalescing into a standalone praise dimension, possibly reflecting cultural differences in expressing extreme positive emotion or review-writing norms that favor balanced, specific feedback over general enthusiasm.

### 4.2.3 Methodological Considerations for Cross-National Comparison

The semantic mapping in Table 4.3 reveals a critical methodological challenge: while all four dimensions appear in both countries, they vary substantially in semantic similarity. Only Emergency Care achieves "High" similarity (>70% thematic overlap)—both countries' dimensions centrally address emergency department services and waiting times. The three other dimensions achieve only "Medium" similarity (50-70%), with meaningful differences in semantic focus:

- **Professional/Nursing Care**: Taiwan combines physicians and nurses emphasizing gratitude and respect (keywords: "physician," "nurse," "professional," "thank you"); USA isolates nursing emphasizing responsiveness and staffing (keywords: "nurse," "patient," "time," "left")
- **Outpatient Services**: Taiwan emphasizes administrative processes (keywords: "registration," "billing," "queuing"); USA emphasizes clinical quality and access (keywords: "doctor," "clinic," "appointment," "pain")
- **Inpatient/Critical Care**: Taiwan addresses routine hospitalizations and visitation policies (keywords: "ward," "hospitalization," "family," "discharge"); USA concentrates on critical care and life-threatening illness (keywords: "dad," "life," "surgery," "ICU")

**Implications for Rating Comparisons.** Cross-national rating comparisons require semantic equivalence—dimensions must measure substantively similar constructs (Harkness et al., 2003). While statistical tests can be computed for all four dimension pairs, only the Emergency Care comparison (High similarity) provides methodologically defensible evidence of system effects on satisfaction. The rating differences for Medium-similarity dimensions (Table 4.3 shows all p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.512 to 0.892) may reflect not only system and cultural differences but also different referents (physicians vs. nurses), different focal concerns (administrative vs. clinical), or different patient populations (routine vs. critical care). We therefore limit formal statistical testing to Emergency Care ratings (Section 4.3) and rely on presence/absence patterns for other cultural and institutional inferences.

This methodological conservatism strengthens our conclusions. When we find strong evidence for institutional and cultural effects using only High-similarity comparisons and presence/absence patterns, these findings rest on solid methodological foundations rather than potentially confounded rating comparisons.

## 4.3 Statistical Testing and Cross-National Comparisons

This section performs statistical testing where our cross-national topic analysis provides methodologically rigorous evidence. We focus on three types of comparisons that our data can definitively support: (1) **presence versus absence** of dimensions across systems, (2) **proportion differences** for semantically equivalent dimensions, and (3) **rating differences** for dimensions with high semantic similarity only.

**Methodological Note on Semantic Equivalence.** Cross-national rating comparisons require that dimensions measure substantively similar constructs. We classify semantic similarity as High (>70% thematic overlap), Medium (50-70%), or Low (<50%). Only dimensions classified as "High" similarity justify direct rating comparisons (Harkness et al., 2003). For example, Emergency Care achieves High similarity—both countries' dimensions focus centrally on emergency department services and waiting times—permitting valid rating comparison. In contrast, Professional/Nursing Care achieves only Medium similarity (Taiwan combines physicians and nurses emphasizing gratitude and respect; USA isolates nursing focusing on responsiveness and staffing shortages), making direct rating comparison methodologically problematic despite statistical significance. We therefore limit rating comparisons to the Emergency Care dimension and rely on presence/absence patterns for other inferences.

### 4.3.1 Billing and Insurance: The "System Tax" of Multi-Payer Healthcare

**Research Question:** Do multi-payer healthcare systems generate billing and insurance concerns as a distinct service quality dimension, while single-payer systems eliminate this dimension entirely?

**Analytical Approach:** Presence-versus-absence comparison of billing/insurance dimensions.

**Evidence:**
- **USA**: Billing & Insurance Issues emerges as a standalone dimension (4.1%, n=132, 2.92 stars) characterized by surprise medical bills, insurance coverage denials, prior authorization delays, and billing errors. Representative keywords include "bill," "billing," "insurance," "charge," and "payment."
- **Taiwan**: No equivalent dimension exists in the seven-topic structure. The Registration & Billing Process dimension (6.9%, 1.83 stars) addresses administrative inefficiencies (queues, waiting times at service counters) but contains no keywords related to costs, insurance, or payment disputes. Taiwanese patients complain about process delays, not financial burdens.

**Interpretation:** This presence-versus-absence pattern provides definitive evidence that healthcare financing structure fundamentally shapes patient quality perceptions. Taiwan's National Health Insurance employs uniform fee schedules and standardized coverage rules, eliminating the complexity and financial uncertainty that characterize American healthcare. Even at top-ranked U.S. hospitals, 4.1% of patient discourse centers on financial and administrative problems created purely by multi-payer system structure—burdens independent of clinical quality. We term this phenomenon the "system tax": multi-payer systems impose satisfaction penalties that single-payer systems eliminate by design.

**Conclusion:** **Strong Evidence for Institutional Effects**

---

### 4.3.2 Emergency Care: Time Consciousness and Efficiency Differences

**Research Question:** Does American culture's monochronic time orientation (Hall, 1976) and individualistic values lead to greater emphasis on efficiency, wait times, and timeliness in healthcare evaluations compared to Taiwan's polychronic, collectivist culture?

**Analytical Approach:** We compare the Emergency Care dimension—the only dimension achieving **High semantic similarity**—using (1) chi-square test for proportion differences and (2) independent samples t-test for rating differences.

**Evidence:**

**(1) Proportion Emphasis**
- Taiwan: 30.9% of reviews (n=1,546 / 5,007 total)
- USA: 34.8% of reviews (n=1,128 / 3,240 total)
- Difference: +3.9 percentage points
- Chi-square test: χ²(1) = 13.74, p < .001***, Cramér's V = 0.041
- **Interpretation**: American patients dedicate significantly more discourse to emergency care despite the modest effect size, reflecting heightened salience of timeliness concerns.

**(2) Satisfaction Levels**
- Taiwan: 1.79 stars (lowest rating across all dimensions)
- USA: 3.25 stars
- Difference: +1.46 stars (US higher)
- Independent samples t-test: t(2672) = 19.97, p < .001***, Cohen's d = 0.782 (medium-large effect)
- **Interpretation**: Despite both countries showing emergency care concerns, American patients rate emergency services significantly higher, suggesting better management of wait times in the multi-payer system where financial barriers reduce utilization.

**(3) Linguistic Evidence**
- USA emergency dimension features prominent temporal quantification: "hour," "hours," "wait," "waiting" appear in top-10 keywords
- Taiwan emergency dimension emphasizes interpersonal aspects: "doctor," "patient," "know," "issue," with less explicit time quantification
- **Interpretation**: American patients explicitly measure and report waiting times, reflecting monochronic time consciousness (Hall, 1976)

**Conclusion:** **Strong Evidence for Cultural Effects** (convergent evidence from proportion, rating, and linguistic patterns)

---

### 4.3.3 Service Attitude: Interpersonal Sensitivity Patterns

**Research Question:** Does Taiwan's collectivist culture and emphasis on interpersonal harmony (Hofstede, 2001) lead to heightened sensitivity to healthcare worker attitudes, manifesting as a distinct service quality dimension absent in individualistic American culture?

**Analytical Approach:** Presence-versus-absence comparison of service attitude dimensions. We do NOT compare ratings for Professional/Nursing Care dimensions due to Medium semantic similarity (methodologically inappropriate).

**Evidence:**
- **Taiwan**: Service Attitude Issues emerges as the third-largest dimension (17.3%, n=866, 1.69 stars)—the lowest-rated dimension after emergency care. Keywords emphasize interpersonal violations: "attitude," "impatient," "rude," "unfriendly," "disrespectful." Patients describe perceived rudeness or impatience from nurses, registration staff, and laboratory technicians as egregious service failures.
- **USA**: No equivalent standalone dimension exists. While nursing care quality (20.5%, 3.00 stars) receives criticism, complaints focus on understaffing, slow response times, and task competence rather than interpersonal demeanor or rudeness.

**Interpretation:** The presence of Service Attitude Issues as a distinct 17.3% dimension in Taiwan—but absence as a standalone U.S. dimension—provides strong evidence for cultural effects. Collectivist cultures emphasizing interpersonal harmony (Hofstede's Individualism: Taiwan 17 vs. USA 91) create heightened sensitivity to perceived interpersonal slights. When healthcare workers violate cultural norms of respect and courtesy, Taiwanese patients experience this as a distinct category of service failure warranting separate dimension status. American patients, with lower expectations for formal courtesy and higher tolerance for directness, do not elevate interpersonal demeanor to dimension-level salience.

**Methodological Note:** We deliberately avoid comparing Taiwan's Medical Professional Quality (4.67 stars) with USA's Nursing Care Quality (3.00 stars) despite the 1.67-star gap's statistical significance (p < .001, d = 0.892). These dimensions exhibit only Medium semantic similarity—Taiwan's dimension combines physicians and nurses with emphasis on gratitude and respect; USA's dimension isolates nursing with focus on responsiveness and staffing. Comparing ratings across these semantically distinct dimensions risks attributing differences to culture when they may reflect different referents (physicians vs. nurses) or system factors (staffing ratios). The presence/absence pattern for Service Attitude provides cleaner cultural evidence.

**Conclusion:** **Strong Evidence for Cultural Effects** (with clearer methodological justification than rating comparison)

---

### 4.3.4 Administrative Complaints: System-Dependent Patterns

**Research Question:** Does healthcare system structure shape the specific nature of administrative complaints, with single-payer systems generating process efficiency complaints and multi-payer systems generating financial complexity complaints?

**Analytical Approach:** Qualitative comparison of administrative dimension content across systems.

**Evidence:**
- **Taiwan**: Registration & Billing Process dimension (6.9%, 1.83 stars) emphasizes process inefficiencies—long queues at registration counters, slow medication pickup, crowded billing windows, inefficient patient flow. Complaints center on time wasted navigating administrative procedures, not costs.
- **USA**: Billing & Insurance Issues dimension (4.1%, 2.92 stars) emphasizes financial complexity—surprise bills, insurance coverage denials, billing errors, prior authorization delays. Complaints center on financial uncertainty and administrative burden of insurance navigation.

**Interpretation:** Both systems generate administrative dissatisfaction, but the nature of complaints reflects system structure. Taiwan's single-payer NHI standardizes pricing and coverage, eliminating financial uncertainty but creating high-volume queuing problems as universal access removes demand-side barriers. America's multi-payer system maintains lower facility utilization but imposes complex insurance navigation, billing disputes, and financial risk on patients. This divergence exemplifies institutional isomorphism (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983): system structure creates distinct administrative pain points that shape patient quality expectations.

**Conclusion:** **Strong Evidence for Institutional Effects**

---

### 4.3.5 Theoretical Implications

Our statistical testing reveals three methodologically important patterns:

**(1) Institutional effects dominate dimensional composition.** The strongest evidence comes from presence-versus-absence comparisons (billing/insurance, service attitude), demonstrating that system structure and cultural context determine which service aspects coalesce into distinct dimensions.

**(2) Rating comparisons require semantic equivalence.** Statistical significance does not justify cross-national rating comparisons when dimensions measure different constructs (e.g., Taiwan physicians+nurses vs. USA nurses only). Only the Emergency Care dimension achieved sufficient semantic similarity for valid rating comparison.

**(3) Service quality is simultaneously universal and contingent.** Core concerns (emergency care, professional competence, administrative processes) appear across contexts (universal), but which concerns achieve dimension-level salience and how they are evaluated varies systematically with institutional and cultural factors (contingent). This reconciles universal service quality frameworks (Parasuraman et al., 1988) with culturally-contingent theories (Donthu & Yoo, 1998).

## Summary of Key Findings

**Research Question 1** (What dimensions emerge?): Taiwan revealed seven dimensions, USA revealed six, with emergency care dominating both countries' discourse (30.9% and 34.8% respectively).

**Research Question 2** (Universal vs. system-specific?): Four dimensions are universal (emergency care, professional/nursing care, outpatient services, inpatient care), accounting for ~78% of reviews. Four dimensions are system-specific (Taiwan: service attitude, facility environment; USA: billing/insurance, positive experience), accounting for ~22% of reviews.

**Research Question 3** (System structure influence?): Healthcare system structure fundamentally shapes patient quality perceptions through: (1) presence/absence of dimensions (billing/insurance exists only in USA; service attitude dimension exists only in Taiwan); (2) satisfaction levels for semantically equivalent dimensions (emergency care shows 1.46-star difference, p < .001, d = 0.782); and (3) administrative pain points (Taiwan: process queuing; USA: insurance disputes).

**Statistical Testing** (Section 4.3): Four key patterns received strong empirical support with rigorous methodological justification: (1) multi-payer system tax via billing/insurance dimension, (2) American time consciousness via emergency care emphasis, (3) Taiwanese interpersonal sensitivity via service attitude dimension, and (4) system-specific administrative complaints. We tested only patterns where our data provide clear, defensible evidence—relying on presence/absence comparisons and limiting rating comparisons to dimensions with High semantic similarity (emergency care only).

**Theoretical Contributions:** (1) Service quality is simultaneously universal and contingent—core dimensions transcend contexts, but evaluative standards and dimensional composition vary systematically with institutional and cultural factors; (2) The "system tax" concept: multi-payer healthcare systems impose satisfaction penalties independent of clinical quality; (3) Institutional effects dominate dimensional composition; cultural effects shape evaluation standards and dimension-level salience; (4) Cross-national comparison requires semantic equivalence—statistical significance alone does not justify rating comparisons across semantically distinct dimensions; (5) Presence/absence patterns provide cleaner evidence than rating comparisons when dimensions measure different constructs.
