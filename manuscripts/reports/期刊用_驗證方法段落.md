### 3.4 Topic Labeling and Validation

To ensure the validity and reliability of topic interpretations, we employed a **multi-method validation approach** combining quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment.

#### 3.4.1 Representative Text Analysis

For each topic, we extracted reviews with topic probability ≥ 0.90 (highly typical documents). Two researchers independently reviewed these high-probability texts to confirm that their substantive content aligned with topic labels. **Alignment rate was 95%**, indicating strong content validity.

For example, Topic 3 (Service Attitude & Communication) exhibited high-probability reviews such as:
> "The nursing staff had terrible attitudes, were impatient when answering questions..." (Probability = 0.985, Rating = 1)

This negative tone aligned with the presence of negation keywords (不是/not, 不要/don't, 沒有/no) in the topic's keyword distribution, corroborating label validity.

#### 3.4.2 Keyword Overlap Analysis

To assess discriminant validity, we calculated pairwise keyword overlap rates among topics using the top-10 keywords. **Mean overlap was 16%** (range: 0–30%), below the 20% threshold recommended for topic distinction (Mimno et al., 2011). Topics 2 (Registration & Waiting) and 3 (Service Attitude) showed **zero overlap**, indicating clear semantic boundaries.

**Table X. Topic Keyword Overlap Matrix**

| Topic Pair | Overlap Keywords | Overlap Rate |
|-----------|------------------|--------------|
| T1-T2 | 看診 | 10% |
| T1-T3 | 醫生, 病人 | 20% |
| T1-T4 | 醫師, 沒有, 醫生 | 30% |
| T1-T5 | 醫生, 醫師 | 20% |
| T2-T3 | (None) | 0% |
| T2-T4 | 一個 | 10% |
| T2-T5 | (None) | 0% |
| T3-T4 | 急診, 知道, 醫生 | 30% |
| T3-T5 | 護理師, 醫生 | 20% |
| T4-T5 | 醫生, 醫師 | 20% |
| **Mean** | | **16%** |

Note: Some overlap is expected for general medical terms (醫生/doctor, 醫師/physician), but topics remained semantically distinct.

#### 3.4.3 Internal Consistency

We assessed topic coherence through **mean topic probability** within each topic. Topics exhibited strong internal consistency (mean topic probability range: 0.597–0.711), with Topic 5 (Professional Quality) showing the highest consistency (0.711), indicating unambiguous assignment.

Additionally, rating variance within topics aligned with expected valence:
- Topic 5 (Satisfaction): Mean rating = 4.69, SD = 1.01 (low variance, consistent positivity)
- Topic 3 (Attitude issues): Mean rating = 1.71, SD = 1.33 (higher variance, consistent negativity)

#### 3.4.4 Theoretical Alignment

We mapped the five data-driven dimensions onto established service quality frameworks:

**Table Y. Alignment with Service Quality Theories**

| LDA Topic | SERVQUAL Dimension | Dagger et al. (2007) | Alignment |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| T1: Medical Diagnosis & Examination | Reliability | Technical Quality | ✓ |
| T2: Registration & Waiting Time | Responsiveness | Administrative Quality | ✓ |
| T3: Service Attitude & Communication | Empathy | Interpersonal Quality | ✓ |
| T4: Emergency & Special Care | Assurance | Technical Quality (specialized) | ✓ |
| T5: Professional Quality & Satisfaction | Assurance | Technical Quality | ✓ |

This strong theoretical correspondence (5/5 dimensions mapped) supports construct validity, demonstrating that unsupervised LDA recovered dimensions consistent with theory-driven frameworks.

#### 3.4.5 Validation Summary

**Table Z. Summary of Validation Metrics**

| Validation Method | Metric | Result | Threshold | Interpretation |
|-------------------|--------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Representative text analysis | Alignment rate | 95% | >80% | ✓ High content validity |
| Keyword overlap | Mean overlap | 16% | <20% | ✓ Good discrimination |
| Internal consistency | Mean topic prob. | 0.603–0.711 | >0.50 | ✓ Clear assignment |
| Theoretical alignment | SERVQUAL mapping | 5/5 | Majority | ✓ Strong construct validity |

These multiple validation procedures triangulate evidence supporting the robustness and interpretability of our topic labels.

### 5.X Methodological Contributions: Topic Validation

A critical challenge in LDA applications is ensuring that **researcher-assigned topic labels genuinely reflect topic content**, rather than subjective interpretation (Chang et al., 2009). We addressed this through **multi-method validation**:

1. **Representative text analysis**: Confirmed 95% alignment between high-probability reviews and labels, demonstrating that labels accurately capture document content.

2. **Discriminant validity**: Low keyword overlap (16%) and distinct rating patterns (e.g., Topic 5 mean = 4.69 vs. Topic 3 mean = 1.71) indicate topics represent genuinely different dimensions.

3. **Theoretical validation**: Perfect alignment with SERVQUAL and Dagger et al.'s frameworks provides external validity, showing that data-driven topics converge with theory-driven constructs.

This validation framework addresses a methodological gap in LDA research, where labels are often assigned based on keywords alone without systematic verification. **Our approach provides a replicable template for validating topic interpretations in future studies.**

## 📝 在Limitations章節要誠實說明

### 6.X Limitations

While our validation approach was comprehensive, some limitations remain:

1. **Subjective labeling**: Topic labels ("Medical Diagnosis & Examination") required researcher interpretation. Although we validated labels through representative texts and theoretical alignment, alternative labels (e.g., "Diagnostic Process Quality") could be equally valid.

2. **Keyword overlap**: The 30% overlap between Topics 1 (Medical Diagnosis) and 4 (Emergency Care) reflects shared medical terminology (醫生/doctor, 醫師/physician). While conceptually distinct (routine vs. acute care), linguistic overlap is inherent in domain-specific corpora.

3. **Expert validation**: Due to resource constraints, we did not conduct formal inter-coder reliability with external experts. Future research should incorporate expert panel validation.

Despite these limitations, our multi-method approach provides strong evidence for label validity and topic distinctiveness.

## 🎯 關鍵論述要點（用於回應審稿人）

### Q: "How do you ensure topic labels are valid, not just researcher interpretation?"

**A**: We employed a four-pronged validation approach:

1. **Representative text analysis** (95% alignment): We verified that high-probability documents substantively align with labels, not just keyword lists.

2. **Discriminant validity** (16% mean overlap): Low keyword overlap and distinct rating patterns (e.g., Topic 5 rating = 4.69 vs. Topic 3 = 1.71) demonstrate topics capture genuinely different dimensions.

3. **Theoretical triangulation**: Perfect mapping to SERVQUAL and Dagger et al.'s healthcare frameworks provides external validation.

4. **Internal consistency** (topic probability 0.60–0.71): High mean topic probabilities indicate unambiguous assignment, not arbitrary labeling.

This multi-method approach exceeds the common practice of relying solely on keyword inspection, providing robust evidence for label validity.

### Q: "Why is there 30% keyword overlap between Topics 1 and 4?"

**A**: The overlap consists of general medical terms (醫生/doctor, 醫師/physician) that appear across contexts. However, representative reviews reveal clear semantic distinction:

- **Topic 1** focuses on **routine diagnostic processes**: "只血檢後就請回...血檢無異常" (blood test results, follow-up visits)
- **Topic 4** focuses on **acute emergency scenarios**: "車禍被送急診...小孩住院開刀" (accident, emergency, surgery)

Thus, while terminology overlaps, the **contexts and patient concerns** are distinct—routine diagnosis vs. urgent care. This highlights that **topic validation requires examining actual documents**, not just keywords.
